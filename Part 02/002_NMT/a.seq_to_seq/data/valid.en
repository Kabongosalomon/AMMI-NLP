did you vote ?
do you think parents should punish their children when they lie ?
we have no choice but to do so .
it s not done yet .
he finally achieved what he set out to do .
we were concerned .
he did well in all subjects particularly mathematics .
i don t know what s going on around here but i intend to find out .
i ll be back in two hours .
brush your teeth before going to bed .
will tom be ready ?
i don t think i can help you .
it s worth a trip .

we study english every day at school .
i thought you d be dead by now .
you may be right but we have a slightly different opinion .
let s take a walk for a change .
this tree is older than that car .
i am off duty tomorrow .
no sooner had he arrived than the bus departed .
why do so many people suffer from low self esteem ?
i think you already have enough money to buy what you need .
how could tom do such a thing ?
how old is this stuff ?
let me give you some advice .
cookie s mother died of cancer .
i m surprised tom never mentioned you .
did you do what i asked ?
do not throw anything out of the window .
the town has changed a great deal since then .
i can survive alone .
why are you looking at me that way ?
she teaches english .
i started this topic .
the girls giggled .
what s really going on here ?
what you re doing makes me nervous .
this room is not very large .

here we go .
that s useful isn t it ?
i want to find out what tom did yesterday .
how is your family name written ?
the style is nice but do you have it in a different color ?
no wonder they turned down her offer .
i have confidence in him .
tom was shot in the head .
i m doing my best .

he felt a pain in his back .
that house needs repainting .
the building that i saw was very large .
it s forbidden .
i have a favor to ask of you .
they replaced the broken television with a new one .
it s unlikely that a hacker could get into our website .

i need to get something to eat .
he fooled her .
they have a beautiful house .
you don t think i can do it do you ?

a true gentleman never betrays his friends .
flashy people irritate him .
he says what he thinks regardless of other people s feelings .
she doesn t know what she really wants .
we traveled together .

i asked a favor of him .
you ve been a good audience .
she asked him to come into her house .
are you going to the theater tonight ?
i want you to come right over .
that s only a temporary solution .
i will protect you .
i didn t see your car outside .

at first i mistook you for your brother .
it will clear up soon .
we both want to go to boston .
the escaped convict is armed and dangerous .
you were my friend .
how strange life is !
why do you laugh so hard at his jokes ? they re not even funny .
he has not written to us since last february .
nothing is more valuable than time but nothing is less valued .
this lid is so tight i can t open it .
he handled the tool skillfully .
we might die .
it might not even work .
this school was founded in .
i feel kind of hungry .
that s a waste of time and money .
turn left at the next corner .
i d like to speak with tom in private .

we waited up for him until two o clock and then finally went to bed .
there are members in the club .
she advised him against doing it .
i don t see a problem with this .
your proposal is a bit extreme .
i strongly agree .
do you think that money really matters to me ?
may i go with him ?

he has never been scolded by his father .
tom is still very unhappy .
she heard him sing .
tom knows a girl named mary .
why did i ever marry you ?
dad s in an impatient mood today .
i don t have any books to read .
isn t he a bit young ?
the park is located in the center of the city .

i admire you .
can i afford it ?

familiarity breeds contempt and children .
i have a truck .

i d say you did well .
i know you want to make me happy .
i thought you d be grateful .
tom wondered why his wife left him .
do not attempt this at home .
i feel better today .
the birds are singing .
get on your knees .
tom has never met mary .
i don t like you anymore .
he said that he would call you later .
you decide .
do you want me to be your bodyguard ?
don t be fooled by his good looks .
we ve used almost all the money .
i can t think of anything that i d like better .
there is an urgent need for better communication .
you d better eat everything that s on your plate .
i m feeling fine now .
the new bridge will have been completed by march .
the company will soon go bankrupt .
tom has actually never been to boston .
i d like to be as rich as tom is .

what are you still doing here ?
how do i look ?
you re doing it right .
the statue has no head .
i lay down to rest .
the statistics gave ammunition to her argument .
that s my chair .
how old is this tree ?
they can t all be full .
you couldn t possibly understand .
do you have plans tonight ?
i want something to eat .
i won t tolerate it anymore .
his explanation doesn t make sense at all .
give them to me .
it was quite funny .
a sponge absorbs water .
don t worry about it ok ?
of the who were arrested four escaped .
tom wants to borrow my car tomorrow .
would you work for minimum wage ?
this year valentine s day falls on a sunday .
nobody suspected anything .
it matters .
who else is here ?
it hurts so much .
i ve been looking all over for you .
i have to say i envy you .
tom pulled out a pencil .
turn down the music .
he must have gotten over his cold .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
i want you to do it at once .
it was worth every penny .
i built my son a new house .
go away . i don t want to see you .
i went to bed early because i was tired .

i wonder what tom thought of it .
your dinner is getting cold .
they want you dead .
tom was annoyed by mary s silence .
i can never stay angry at tom for very long .
i just don t feel that way about you .
what is your decision ?
don t stand up .
are you speaking to me ?
here are the tickets .
my uncle was standing there with his arms folded .
we know very little about the cause of this disease .
it s not funny .
they want you to resign .
i don t want you to do that tom .
i want to have something to remember you by .
the boat sank during the storm .
i had him write the letter for me .
her mother will continue to work .
tom has changed a lot since then .
you must know tom pretty well .
i didn t know where to get the bus .
we discussed the matter .
the suspect began to confess at last .
i remember those days .
try not to cry .
he s a very nice boy .
the idea isn t bad .
it looks so real .
i figured i could count on you .
