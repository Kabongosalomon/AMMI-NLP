how much am i paying you ?
fortunately the weather was good .
i think we should be allowed to go anywhere we want .
i lost my camera .

i ve been evicted .
i want to look different .
you ve got to be bold !

his silence surprised me .
her complaints never cease .
i thought we were welcome here .
i know a good restaurant that s inexpensive .
according to the papers the man has finally confessed .
we will soon be having snow .
how long do you plan on staying here ?
he s not such a great writer and i think he knows it .

i think it s highly unlikely that you ll be able to do that by yourself .
i ll take my dog out for a walk .
i d like to go home now .
i m calling from tom s mobile phone .
i m surprised no one else heard the gunshots .
i m creative .

she invited him in .
mary s husband abused her .
the weather turned better .

how does she do it ?
i ordered the book from england .
help me out here .
we accept all major credit cards .
tom didn t attend today s meeting .
i have a dictionary .
i m aware of my responsibilities .
during the rush hours in tokyo traffic is heavy .
he gave me a smile of recognition .
i gave way to their demands .
i was curious .
we ve all done things we re not proud of .
it is doubtful whether he will come or not .
many people encouraged me to fulfill my ambitions .
it tastes like chicken .
the value of the dollar began to drop .
don t your neighbors ever complain ?
he had scarcely escaped when he was recaptured .
my mother put a large vase on the shelf .
a gentle wind is blowing .
this food smells rotten .
her fears gradually quietened down .
i can t give up .
i can t believe what i m hearing .
she called off the party .
it is not surprising that he was elected mayor .
straighten up .
i rescued the cat .
we have plenty of time to spare .
your answer to the question turned out to be wrong .
tom seems to have it in for me .
that was ours .

i always feel blue on mondays .
i found it difficult to understand what he was saying .
what are you smiling at ?
i had chicken pox as a kid .
i didn t get much sleep last night .

i can t really remember .
he is accustomed to hard work .
i want you back today .
you re resourceful .
i bought the book for ten dollars .
i couldn t walk .
i don t know if he knows it .
i hope i can count on your discretion .
i see what you did there .
what were you doing when she came ?
is anyone going to eat that ?
tom could have told me the truth .
they really slept on the floor .
i made it myself .
i think it d be better if tom didn t tell mary about this .
do you agree with this ?
tell me where you ve been .
why would anyone do such a thing ?
he failed the entrance exam .
i thought he was rich .
you ll get another chance .
we came by to wish you luck .
i ve never seen him before .
to make a long story short everything went fine .
tom fell asleep while driving and caused an accident .
school begins at nine .
nobody saw anything .
above all you must help each other .
everybody likes to goof off .
i believe we can get that done .
there are frequently earthquakes in japan .
i m not worried about you .
they did not know it was impossible so they did it .
he s curious about everything .
i want to deposit some money .
it was a crime of passion .
eating too much may lead to sickness .
your wife is going to ask you for a divorce .
you were there weren t you ?

i m pleased with their performance .
i tried to protect you .
i don t know how long i can stay .
i ve been trying to get your attention .
we have to go .
the u .s . department of health says people should exercise at least two and a half hours a week .
perhaps he will come .
a fire broke out in the middle of the city .
he took off his coat .
she is quite a clever girl .
i lost the watch .
will you please let me go now ?
tom owns a small advertising company .
i ve known her since i was little .
why did you make such a mistake ?
you must do it .
she took advantage of her paid vacation and went skiing .
have you ever been run over ?
the dogs bayed at the full moon .
he left me the keys .
the fugitive crossed the river .
where are our friends ?
we have to bring our teaching methods up to date .
we need to conserve ammunition .
are you sure about this ?
i m absolutely certain of it .
he got more than he bargained for .
actually it was quite simple .
pork doesn t agree with me .
i had a great time here .
they are very cheerful .
the sea is blue .
he will be delighted to see you .
my brother did it on my behalf .
i suppose you want to ask me where i ve been .
the snow melted away when spring came .
let s take a trip .
he betrayed my confidence .
my grandfather always sits in this chair .
he was wounded in a burglary .
you re very timid .
you may still be in luck .
i can t blame you .
i can see some people walking across the street .
i m breast feeding my baby .
you think you re pretty funny don t you ?
what grade did you get on the test ?
she thanked him for his help .
you re the laziest person i know .
i hope that it is fine tomorrow .
i m delighted to meet you .
we have a similar predicament .
i once worked in a restaurant .
we bought a new washing machine .
i can t believe you didn t recognize me .
i want to be noticed .
did i hurt you ?
children are sometimes afraid of the dark .
sorry about the mess .
is that you ?
you re going to win today .
everyone s eating .
she is related to him .
they found gunshot residue on the victim s hand .
how do you access the internet ?
she gave an oral report to her boss .
what scared tom the most was the thought that he might not be able to walk again .
i still want to go .
i took control of the situation .
what does silence sound like ?
it is true that he is young but he is very reliable .
what a clever dog !
he complained about the noise .
i never received the money .
i often spend my leisure time listening to the radio .
he is over the hill you know .
has he gone already ?
tom isn t sure where to go .
as far as i know he s a nice guy .
don t be naive .
i m sorry i yelled at you .
tom didn t die in vain .
i wanted to help you .
she kept crying all night .
where is your father ?
who else is with you ?
perhaps we overlooked something .
i d never let that happen .
the news made them happy .
am i under arrest ?
i guess both of us were lying .
ain t he cute ?
nobody contributed to the understanding of dreams as much as freud .
it is no good to you .
that cheese is made from goat s milk .
i m not sure i want to do this now .
cuff him .
let me paint you a picture .
this isn t a safe place .
i saw the cake you made .
why were you absent yesterday ?
i want my father to see the movie .
thanks a lot . i appreciate that .
cows provide us with milk .
he was impatient to see his son .
i ll take it into consideration .
he s a senior .
that leaves no room for doubt .
that s not our fault .
i hate when that happens .
i think it s time for me to call it quits .
they did it in front of the staff .
a good lie is easier to believe than the truth .
it was sort of fun .
she aimed at the target .
don t make me say it .
i ve finished all except the last page .
i tried to tell tom but he refused to listen .
i will forgive him out of consideration for you .
i know you must be afraid .
they re two very different things .
he kept on telling lies .
it s not the same anymore .
the company produces soy sauce and other food products .
don t worry . my lips are sealed .
he likes sweets .
i didn t even see you once last year .
where have you been all this time ?
stand where you are !
they lifted her above their heads .
stop grumbling .
i never thought that would happen .
the product is guaranteed to be free from defects .
he turned his back on the old tradition .
i strolled along the streets to kill time .
would you ever go out with a guy who couldn t sing ?
she donated countless pieces to the museum .
tom sat at his desk .
what would he know ?
you re considerate .
i m going to have to call you right back .
god sent a sign .
he seems to have told a lie .
he had a bitter experience .
he had a talent for painting .
tom sounds exhausted .
have a beer with me .
i figured i d find you here .
my sister is always weighing herself .
i d like to get married to someone like you .
there s no such thing as a free lunch .
you re articulate .
i knew someone would come rescue us eventually .
i thought i recognized you .
i m not going to lose .
i just want to be left alone for a while .
i wish i had your job .
tom pressed the intercom button .
spend your time wisely and you ll always have enough of it .
swimming makes your legs strong .
i have a hunch that it will rain .
she hates country music .
i want you to help me clean it up .
you d better tell him the truth .
tom is chubby .
i m sure we can work this out .
wait . i want to tell you something .
he was so sad that he almost went mad .
i hate to see you so miserable .
he never fails to write to his mother every day .
he came to japan seven years ago .
he moved from place to place .
how can i repay you ?
are you sure about that ?
the train has not arrived yet .
i ve never seen so many birds at one time before .
do you really think tom is happy ?
tom told mary to tell the truth .
relationships involve compromise .
tom is sleeping like a baby .
what did you get hit with ?
we volunteered .
do you have to stay ?
this is my i .d . card .
get off at the next stop and take a bus headed to the airport .
tom broke his arm .
they all knew .
i don t like going out by myself at night .
tom hasn t met mary .
i m still married .
i m going to kill him for this !
the people are friendly here .
are you still in love with your wife ?
he accepted reluctantly .
where s the mail box ?
a flu shot contains antibodies that fight the h n virus .
at what time is dinner served ?

tom tried to stand up but he couldn t .
what else can you do ?
i lost three kilograms .
do you mind if i turn on the radio ?
do you know how to pronounce this word ?
who is your favorite player ?
the teacher pointed her finger at me and asked me to come with her .
i saw one .
give that book back to me .
it made me laugh .
tom has red hair .
it is abnormal to have the heart on the right side .
this is nothing .
he is not the sort of man who counts on others for help .
what newspaper do you subscribe to ?
i met him by chance .
she picked out a pink shirt for me to try on .
she showed us a beautiful hat .
tom groaned loudly .
yesterday was a good day .
i m sorry i lost my temper .
we will only consent on that condition .
hundreds of unemployed men sleep there day and night .
he s a lovely young man .
she was lying face down on the bed .
i need to be alone .
he used a big piece of paper to make the bag .
this book is easy to read .
please remain seated for a few minutes .
i see her sweeping the room .
one minute has sixty seconds .
canned food doesn t interest her .
tom doesn t understand because he wasn t paying attention .
why would you ever want to do a job like that ?
few people came to the lecture .
everyone thinks i m going mad .
he has a swelling on his head .
it s a fine day .
i can t forget about that stupid movie .
i heard strange noises coming from his bedroom .
you ll be safe .
would you go to your room ?
tom will leave the company at the end of the year .
she asked me if i could sew .
i just don t want to discuss it right now .
i m done with it .
tom hurried out of the building .
i think it s time for me to get a new email address .
i m sure it wouldn t be too hard to find out who hacked into our system .
how do you feel about gun control ?
i think we re going to stay for another day .
i prefer to go alone .
place it wherever you like .
tom does love you .
do you think that you would enjoy being famous ?
why are you guys so angry ?
if you could come i d be really happy .
you ve got a lot of nerve bringing me here under false pretenses .
i may actually have to go .
do you think he s really into me ?
you ll be safe with him .
there s a car coming .
can you translate this manuscript from french to english ?
all the desk drawers were empty .
is he tall ?
i m cleaned out .
i love parties .
he s a nerd .
i ve asked you this question before .
advance two steps .
britain is separated from the continent by the channel .
there s something about this translation that isn t quite right .
the falling of the berlin wall was truly a momentous occasion .
were the windows closed ?
save me some ice cream .
since i was sick for a week i m making every possible effort to catch up .
my mother is sick in bed .
may i go home now ?
i won t be here that long .
tom went to a nearby convenience store to buy something to eat .
the post office is the brown building .
i want to be certain you are who you say you are .
there were many things that we wanted to do but we never got around to doing many of them .
tom took a book down from the shelf .
tom can trust mary .
they re enjoying themselves .
that s not an issue anymore .
you ain t seen nothing yet .
i felt ill .
i hate being alone this time of year .
i came with my friends .
how is your last name written ?
we ll be back after the break .
just ignore him .
i amused myself .
it s an old custom .
only one man survived .
what s today s exchange rate ?
i hope my dream will come true .
i m fussy .
i never should ve let you go home alone last night .
bring me a drink .
i don t get along with that guy .
we apologize for this inconvenience .
i want you to think about this .
he did the right thing .
we are looking forward to the holidays .
you have changed a lot .
she is quick at everything .
she met him on the beach .
do you mind if i turn off the ac ?
i didn t know there was a pond here .
i have nothing else .
i m going to rewrite this report .
when will you go ?
tom is a close friend of mine .
did you tell anybody ?
i m beginning to get curious .
what is the good of having a car if you don t drive ?
i think that s fair .
nobody knows what s going to happen .
you must obey the traffic rules .
don t change a thing .
i m not as stupid as you think i am .
i had no idea you were so young .
i wanted to laugh .
i need your answer by the end of the day .
you should be careful not to become overconfident .
he likes to talk about himself .
he had an accident at work .
i want to die soon .
how did you get hurt ?
you re the only one who can help me .
is there a timetable ?
do you think that ll happen soon ?
i saw her taking a walk in the park at midnight .
this is taking forever .
i invited all my friends .
i appreciate you calling me .
i shouldn t have to put up with this noise .
i didn t even notice you were there .
i ll tell you whatever you want to know .
i know what they re like .
i want him to play the guitar .
i fell in love in an unlikely place .
i m tough .
ain t that cute ?
get out of the van .
tom was dangerous .
how did you get into this line of work ?
is it true that tom has a twin ?
it was much more difficult than we initially thought .
they took a big risk .
what did you hide ?

many trees fell down .
isn t there something you want to say to tom ?
he had served as a congressman and senator .
no sooner had she opened the door than a cat ran out .
i think we re going to win .

i ended up winning .
you lost an earring .
you re the owners .

his lackadaisical attitude to studying explains his poor grades .

this climate is having a bad effect on your health .
tom knows what the problem is .
i m pretty sure that tom doesn t have a brother .
do you still want me to give tom your old computer ?
you need this .
she advised him to come back at once .
i thought you d agree .
that s too easy .
i ve forgotten my email address .

he felt it was his duty to go .
you never should ve done that .

urgent business kept me from coming sooner .
i regretted having wasted a great deal of time .
scientists are fighting to stem the spread of the aids virus .
tom dug a hole in the sand .
can i get you a drink ?
christmas is coming soon .
have you ever heard such a story ?
i saw the light at the end of the tunnel .
that s what i told him .
my uncle lives in new york .
it was impolite of him to do so .
is it that hard ?
please leave .
it can be very cold here even in may .
you can stay till tonight .
i know what s right .
nobody can keep us apart now .
that doesn t surprise me .
this is kind of embarrassing .
mary wanted me to look the other way while she was getting dressed .
you should read a book like the one he is reading now .
she was very proud of her father .
are you going to a movie ?
did you do this ?
tom is not a hero .
they knew exactly how much of a risk they d be taking .
she brushed her husband s hat .
she nodded in response to my question .

i m rarely this angry .
tom s eyes were glued to the screen .
i ll be sixteen years old next month .
keep your eyes on the road .
all our money is gone .
people live only about years .
i opened the box but it was empty .
tom felt helpless and frightened .
let s hope for the best .
are you good at keeping secrets ?
you were hot weren t you ?
he asked me what i had been doing .
it was a beautiful sunny day .

you don t have to use a dictionary when you read this book .
he s reading a novel now .
what language were they speaking ?
i want you to go upstairs .
you didn t have to say yes .
because of that virus many elephants lost their lives .

i want to watch .
something is not right .
tom didn t know where mary wanted to spend her summer vacation .
help is on its way .
it s better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes .
you need to be prepared .
they mistook my politeness for friendship .
he is a bad person .
you should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive .
i smoke cigarettes .
here s where the fun begins .
good luck with the new job .
i d rather do this without your help .
nobody came to help him .
the story was in all the papers .

which way should we go ?
it won t take so long .
i don t think tom is listening .
she kept me waiting for over an hour .

i wish you had come with us .
it s quite clear to me that this is the truth .
what exactly do you want us to do ?
tom died a few years ago .
the bullet penetrated his chest leaving him in critical condition .

he was found mysteriously murdered .
you re very upset .
i like your new hair color .

a day without laughter is a day wasted .
the mere sight of a dog frightens him .

tom returned from the kitchen with two mugs of coffee and sat down next to mary .
and then he chased the cattle the sheep and everyone out of the temple .
the students divided themselves into three groups .
i agree with what you said .

i think i d like to be a teacher .
we re deluding ourselves .
i know you re busy but i could use some help .
she told me his name after he had left .
this information checks out all right .
i shouldn t have gone there by myself .
stay out of my way !
try it again .
tom wants mary s approval .
i used to work in a bank .
that sounds reasonable .
i thought we talked about this already .

how are you ?
don t tell me to calm down .
we don t trust the government .
you can t keep this a secret .
let s concentrate .
you have to be strong .
my friends don t pay attention to me anymore .
i carried one bag but the other one was left behind .
you must read the textbook closely .
why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors ?
who will pay ?
i found no money left in my pocket .
she turned her old dress into a skirt .
if you don t want to go you don t have to .
he who is not satisfied with a little is satisfied with nothing .
i don t know whether to accept or refuse .

the telephone is ringing . if you want i ll answer it .
how long have you been waiting for the bus ?
tom put on his coat and left .

it s a misunderstanding .
he usually comes home late .

we arrived at the office on time .
i know where you hide your diary .
you re the only one i trust .
he doesn t look his age .
i m adding the finishing touches now .
he has gone mad .
tom lost the bet .
you should return what you borrow .
i don t know whether it is true or not .

i m glad i invited you .
i never said that .
we are fully aware of the importance of the situation .

it s a pity that he can t marry her .
we had a lot of rain last year .
he held his breath .
you don t have to come .
it s six degrees below zero .
this computer is powerful efficient and easy to use .
he beckoned me to follow him .

are you threatening me ?
would you say it once more ?
you must show respect to your guests .
i can t do it .
i m ready !

when we arrived the crowd had faded away .
i asked her if she could go to the party .
do you think this plan is unrealistic ?
that man has a bad reputation .
you don t have the nerve .
you shouldn t get married .
she has never danced with him .
we all sang in unison .
radio is a great invention .
we need it .
leave out this word .
you re annoying me .
they laughed .
you ll understand it later on .
i think it s time for me to call a doctor .
i hope you re well rested .
do you know what i mean ?
i heard her sing a song .
that changes nothing .
why would anyone do that on purpose ?
can you believe what he said ?
don t get all high and mighty .
i should ve seen this coming .
tom might be able to fix that .
my camera can shoot high definition video .
it s difficult being rich .
are you a student ?
don t slam the door .
life seems so unfair .
you don t even know who they are .
these pills come in a blister pack .
i like writing with a fountain pen .
they agreed on everything .

if you came that would be great .
i thought you d be dead by now .
he pointed to the tower over there .
we re adaptable .
you re such a flirt .
they work at night .
presently the plan is still in the air .
tom told a joke but nobody laughed .
the way she talks gets on my nerves .
he remembers to write to her every week .

you could pass for a teenager if you wore a t shirt .
he was constantly borrowing money from me .
tom i m in trouble . i need you to come get me .

he said he would not come in but he came in after all .
i don t think we should do that .

according to the newspaper it s going to rain today .
i have no time to do my homework .
tom said he didn t want to eat anything .
she was advised by him to stop smoking .
how will you change this ?
you can t go out .
it sickens me .
it is necessary that we provide for the future .
i guess you re right about that .
by the way where are you from ?
they slept in the same room .
i totally believe you .

this is someone i want you to meet .
have you ever broken a bone ?
since i had a slight fever i stayed in bed .

you re bossy .
i need a little help here .
he came when i was out .
he s a friend of my brother s .
it reminded me of you .
he seems to have missed the point .
it d be better to avoid her now because she s violent .
it was nice of you to come all this way to see me .
his success delighted his parents .
i don t believe that either .
we did nothing wrong . it was only a kiss .
i wash my hair every day .
they looked up at the sky .
could we take you somewhere else ?

he succeeded in swimming across the river .
strange rumors are going around .
i must have tried on everything in the shop but nothing looked right on me .
when mary reached the bus stop the last bus had already left .
we ve already begun .

yesterday as i was walking along the street i saw an accident .
you don t need to wait .
the room is crawling with spiders .
when do you want to eat ?
tom is clearly lost .
he has a beard .
someday you should give it a try .
you re not late .
i intend to listen to it tonight .
finishing the job by tuesday will be a piece of cake .
he works in a call center .
all are present .
tom has a beard .
what makes you so sure that this won t happen again ?
it is never too late to learn .
they have to repair their car .
that sounded like a gunshot .
will you tell me how long you have loved him ?
tom often talks to his parents on skype .
you have a lot of money and i have none .
she is all skin and bone .
my pen is out of ink .
wake up !
don t forget your toothbrush .
i hope i m wrong but i doubt it .
i just want tonight to be special .
i usually don t bother with people like him .
one of my hobbies is collecting old stamps .
she tore the letter to pieces .
i eat a lot of carrots .
europeans like to drink wine .
we re not guilty .
everything went smoothly .
i believe that story .
you disappoint me .
open your mouth !
do you still want to go to the lighthouse ?
tom certainly gave the impression that he wasn t planning on being there tomorrow .
the park was almost empty .
i only have one condition .
tom is sweating .
i don t have enough money to advertise .
the government is not doing its best to solve the housing problem .
tom pressed a hidden button .
the boy didn t change his opinion .
she assumed an air of indifference .
i made the deal .
tom bought mary some expensive clothes .
i have no recollection of seeing the man .
have you ever had lunch at this restaurant ?
are you ready to begin ?
i know what to watch for .
americans have the right to bear arms .
i ll just have one or two beers .
i could scarcely believe it .
do you like surprises ?
tom is kind of worked up about it .
i think your answer is correct .
i thought i heard you .
just pretend you don t know me .
he lived there all by himself .
please reconsider .
i came back to help you .
to the best of my knowledge the rumor is not true .
my mother made a sweater for me .
you re missing the point .
a man s worth lies not in what he has but in what he is .
what did your mom say ?
half of the apples are rotten .
i refuse to be taken in by her guile .
we played on the beach .
that s the way he likes it .
okay i m ready .
i have every confidence in his ability .
we sat face to face with executives .
i m sorry if i disturbed you .
compare the two carefully and you will see the difference .
i don t know if i still have it .
do you know what tom does in his free time ?
i m really not busy .
is that all we need ?
it s a misunderstanding .
where can i buy stamps ?
do you need a ride home ?
it doesn t matter which side you re on .
how did you get acquainted with her ?
he dashed out of the store .
the car stalled because you didn t step on the clutch .
the next station is where you get off .
i caught a cold .
i opened one eye .
we were up all night talking .
when tom opened the door he saw mary standing there with a six pack and a pizza .
your sister is beautiful as ever .
tom will be in boston next year .
let s paint the town red .
tom didn t get paid for the work he did .
you re too old for me .
what s your favorite non alcoholic beverage ?
i took tom to the hospital .
i stayed up late last night .
they re part time employees .
she advised him to stop taking that medicine but he felt he needed to .
who said you could speak ?
where do you think we came from ?
tom doesn t know where he was born .
he patted me on the shoulder .
a lot of houses were washed away by the flood .
i m ready to start working whenever you are .
how many times do you have to go to the dentist ?
he crossed the street .
are you up to the task ?
he never breaks promises .
i had stuff to do .
i study at school .
that was then and this is now .
i can t believe we haven t run into each other before .
what sort of things do you do on weekends ?
tom is older than me .
they kidnapped me .
his heart is broken .
we just want to be happy .
you ought not to call at this time of night .
have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant ?
i can t help thinking my father is still alive .
they didn t offer me anything to drink .
do you remember what you were watching ?
i just did what the boss asked me to do .
i share your feelings .
you will have to work a lot .
do you wish to go ?
i know you did this .
after we finish digging the trench planting the flowers will be easy .
tell me again where you live .
do you really want to win ?
what time is dinner ?
must i write in ink ?
my mother told me to mow the lawn .
whatever you do don t push that button .
i hate that you have to be here .
i hate what i ve become .
are you certain ?
some of the money was stolen .
i couldn t find it .
we re fine .
how would you like your steak done ?

you may use my new car .
i don t believe that ghosts exist .
you re very emotional .
he has been gaining weight .
i always brush my coat when i come home .

i got off lightly .
can you describe it ?

they will get married next month .
i know that this is important to you .
we ll keep in touch .
i have ten times as many books as you have .
the days grow shorter as winter approaches .
they received a box of books .
he walked across the garden .
i m going to move next month .
i have three children .
a conductor directs an orchestra .
i had everything under control .

since it rained i did not go .
i don t consider that adequate .
you re greedy .
we all quit .
let s talk this thing out ok ?
tom and mary finally decided to get divorced .
i like listening to tom play the guitar .
a relationship based on total honesty is bound to fail .
why are you sitting there ?
he said i will say nothing more because i hate making excuses . 
you re not wanted here .
why take that risk ?
tom walks quickly .
you re a wonderful friend .
i m watching you .
you should eat vegetables .
stick out your tongue .
i love watching movies that make me think .
it s been a pleasure doing business with you .
you must turn in your old license in order to get a new one .
i see you had to work late again last night .
i watched tv this morning .
he rejected our offer .
allied forces were attacking from the west .
generally women live years longer than men .
tom sometimes walks to work .
i m not young anymore .
i felt awful .
i m not buying your story .
he was checking you out .
he asked for a cigarette .
he denies having broken the window .
the meat is really tender .
don t shout like that . i can hear you perfectly .
these cars are ours .
one of us will have to go .
i am lazy .
what relieves the pain ?
tom was the one who took this picture .

i really like china .
i think we should all go inside .
your father won t buy it .
you should help your father .
you are the one .
i got my hair cut today .
thanks for having me .
don t interrupt me .
all of a sudden i felt a sharp pain in my stomach .
she has many valuable books .
my father cut wood with a saw .
we ve just finished breakfast .
that s not what i had in mind .
write something .
knowledge is power .
i ll be with you in a second .
where are you now ?
you must respect senior citizens .
tom may not wait any longer .
my father has been in good shape since his operation .
every family has a skeleton in the closet .
he is riding a bicycle .
i don t understand women .
i destroyed everything .
his record will never be broken .
put some salt on your meat .
the old man looks sad .
she always walks to school .

price is not an issue .
he couldn t understand the sentence .
i can t carry on like this .
tom doesn t know what s going on .
i expected better of tom .
don t you think that s a bit odd ?
it s just a formality .
this doesn t work !
if you re smart you ll cash out while you re ahead .
is there a problem ?
they all cheated .
tom put thirty dollars on the table .
let me tell you how i really feel .
i was thinking exactly the same thing .
can t we start again ?
i m already rich .
you re making a terrible mistake .
he s the one who touched me .
we saw you .
i think tom can help .
the news made me happy .
her speech was excellent .
we have two kids .
tom said he d be willing to try anything once .
i think of you as a friend .
every movement is painful .
they re jittery .
tom is hardly ever at home .
we re done talking .
i couldn t get that lucky .

he is the most obstinate child i have ever seen .
i can t agree with you .
he can t come with us .
i wish tom would stop that .

that kind of thing isn t important .
i was lonely .
i don t believe this is really happening .
i m lucky today .
i wish this was all over .
it s none of your business .
the snow prevented the train from running .
the flood deposited a layer of mud .

tom was trying to control his anger .
why are you alone ?
i had a good time during the trip .
the president s son leads the special forces .
let me get this straight .
i remember when i first saw you .

the five of us stood in a circle holding hands .
you ve made your point .
he deserves to know the truth .
it s hard to tell .

he went far away .
tom couldn t hide his pain .

i finally bought the toy .
i never saw you .
what is he doing ?
when the man saw a policeman he fled .
what does that prove ?
tom just died .
hey you two ! what are you doing ?
he gets up early .
i think you re completely right .
i thought you might be lonely so i came over with a bottle of wine .
if anyone can do it you can .
he fell in love with her .

they didn t see it .
tell me what i did wrong .
i feel so embarrassed .
she put on socks .
i love her so much i could die .
things are only going to get worse .
you are so stupid .
the spectators cheered the players on .
i don t know about the others but as for me i m for it .
these aren t my keys .
i just had to check on something .

why would you do that without telling us ?
i have nothing else to wear .
she made me cookies .
she had no one to turn to .
they re lying .

i appreciate the invitation .

i realized what was happening .
that s really all i know .
she looked him right in the eye .
no one saw us .
it is good to be a winner .
lemons and limes are acidic fruits .
i told tom i was going to handle it .
never in my wildest dreams did i ever think you d go out with me .
that s the law .
his father is conservative and old fashioned .
what am i to do now ?
i don t think it was a mistake .
i wouldn t want to be a judge .
they awarded her a gold metal for her achievement .
you still have a lot to learn about women .
i arrived too late to hear his speech .

he was unaware of the danger .

i doubled over with laughter .
smartphones would have seemed like science fiction ten years ago .
we re too vulnerable .
have you ever lived in boston ?
it made me laugh .
we listened to her for some time .
he believes he knows everything .
she cried .
her family is very large .
we don t have enough time .
you shouldn t have gone to visit tom alone .
you re not like me .
minnesota s state bird is the mosquito .
he does not understand modern technology .

we re on speaking terms .
tom left mary alone in the car .
i really misjudged you .
i eat alone .
most boys take after their fathers .
he said nothing that would make her angry .
can i speak to the person in charge ?
a decision had to be made .
i ll quit .
you d better believe it .
he comes here almost every day .
he s the scapegoat .
you can t pay someone to sleep for you .
how lucky can one guy be ?
we got ready .

you ll be able to see the difference very easily .
can you keep a secret ?
no one got sick .
i am in trouble .
i lost my favorite pen .
they ve defused the bomb successfully .
if anyone were to talk to me like that i would call a police .
her coat was too casual for the occasion .

who is that guy ?
i thought your house was downtown .
i beg you to give me a little water .
i know you re probably mad about what i said yesterday .
we got lost in the fog .
we have no hot water because the pipes broke .
i m not blushing !

i want to hear what everyone has to say .
he is alert to every chance of making money .

my significant other works at a language school and loves it very much .
we must be cautious .
i heard that .
bad teeth often cause pain .
the drug addict had to undergo rehabilitation .
i can t understand anything tom is saying .

what happened to all those people ?
he went to the store .
mary looked at herself in the mirror .
are you close to your family ?
now let s get down to work .
hurry up or you ll miss the bus .
the glass is full of milk .
does the price include breakfast ?
they did not want to spend much time talking about it .
i lost sight of my friends .

the telephone rang a few minutes later .
you re resilient .
stop being so nice .

the ground was very rocky .
she isn t afraid of death .
in lincoln was elected president of the united states .
i think tom said he d be staying in boston for three weeks .
you obviously don t live here .
i couldn t tell you why .
tom and i aren t friends . we re just coworkers .
they regarded the man as a danger to society .
she is familiar with the subject .
this is terrible .

america did away with slavery .
during droughts farmers are barely able to eke out a living .
i couldn t stop laughing .
he described exactly what happened .

i do not like this song .
we ought to be ready for whatever comes .
we re not cowards .
i ll take a shortcut across the garden .
the locals are very hospitable .

i d be surprised if they asked me to give a speech .
he has three sons .
something was wrong with the watch .
go get your shoes polished .
please take care of my dog while i am away .
he hesitated before answering .
a considerable amount of money was appropriated for the national defense .
please answer me .
be confident .
what makes you think i want your help ?
she told him that she didn t love him .
it should be fun .
we did nothing wrong .
where do you work now ?

fire is dangerous .
i ll get my coat .
who is he talking to ?
i d like you to postpone your trip .
i don t have any money .
do you have a pet ?
tom declined my invitation .
i thought i d find you here .
which way did you choose ?
she lay awake for hours thinking about him .
i paid attention .
my younger brother is watching tv .
do you have a problem with what was suggested ?
my sister got married in her teens .
smoking is harmful to your health .
don t you want to go ?
i m looking forward to the party .

that toy is made of wood .
i didn t understand much of what they were talking about .
what happened to you ?
you re not leaving until i say it s ok .
i believe in my abilities .
we ll talk about this later .
she has him under her thumb .
men know nothing about women .
even though it s small it s still a great car .
i really doubt it .
i still care .
why did you guys break up ?
they were not impressed .
i don t think tom can deal with the situation .
it s a lot easier to fall in love than to stay in love .
i hope this fine weather holds .
you re enjoying yourself aren t you ?
i didn t read it all .
relax a moment .
a lot of people feel the same way tom does .
he has access to the american embassy .
i want you to handle it .
she asked him if he was a student at this school .
you re not supposed to do that are you ?
i thought we were friends .
you re so sweet .
tell me where she lives .
i opened the drawer .
i just don t want anybody to get hurt .
we don t want you to hurt yourself .
let s ask the boy who lives next door .
let me have a try .
sooner or later his luck will run out .
what do you think you ll do with your life ?

i ll talk to you tomorrow .
no one escaped .
i wish you had done what i asked you to do .
everyone was shocked by the news .
tom doesn t know who mary is going to go to boston with .
let me take a gander .
nothing i did helped .
you re the most beautiful woman i ve ever held in my arms .
i need to find something to cut this with .
that hat becomes you .
i can t believe you think i m pushy .
i hope this data will be useful to you .
there s nothing we can do about it .
mind your own business !
he can only pay twenty dollars at most .
they were afraid of being overheard .
i speak from experience .
it seems that tom is upset about something .
tom never gets invited to parties .
what are you guys drinking ?
we work from nine to five .
i think you deserve more than this .
i think tom is in love with me .
i m certainly not your friend .
i made a deposit in the bank yesterday .
my wife looked surprised .
we discussed the problem at length .
can i pay later ?
i found the bed very comfortable .
you cannot swim here .
give it to anyone you like .
divide and conquer .
the bike s mine .
i hope it helps .
this happened to us too .
the prince was lost in the woods .
i can t afford to shop at such an expensive store .
his father disapproved of him .
you look terrific .
look at the picture at the top of the page .
i m not done with you yet .
you shouldn t look down on him .
an apple a day keeps the doctor away .
he would give an arm and a leg for that .
i didn t understand any of that .
my aunt gave me an album .
our uncle bought us movie tickets .
that s just what he needed .
he had suffered some failures .
you should make sure that you have enough money in your pocket to pay for the ticket .
i m asking you to tell me how you feel .
how are we feeling today ?
have you ever donated blood ?
next thing you know you ll be in the papers .
every day they killed a llama to make the sun god happy .
i didn t meet him again after that .
she thought that i was the doctor .
tom is determined to help mary .
don t use your real name .
it was quite dark when i got home .
it is no good to you .
i just want to hang out with you .
you can pour the wine into the glass .
to the best of my knowledge this is the only translation available .
i have no reason to lie to you .
i just want you to be happy .
he has no more strength .
i d like you to meet a friend of mine .
how do you want me to handle that ?
take mine .
you look terrific .
i m sorry i can t help you .
it s very entertaining .
what s your hobby ?
that s a very old saying .
i must study .
i told him what to do .
farmers always complain about the weather .
i want to stay alive .
as soon as she got her salary she spent it all .
no one can help you tom .
she has a cheerful personality .
he appeared honest .
he must have entered this room .
you guys having fun ?
if your tooth hurts you should see a dentist .
they don t like to do that .
i like wearing old clothes .
this won t be the last time .
i can t put up with him .
it had started to rain .
the time has come for you to play your trump card .
i m sure tom told you i was coming .
i live nearby .
you don t mind if i leave early do you ?
remember what we spoke about yesterday .
what if he fails ?
don t make this personal .
that s the point i m trying to make .
i only found out about that today .
i hope that won t happen .
this isn t the time or the place .
open the bottle .
i had fun here .
i think we re already too late .
nobody suspected anything .
you are such a sweetheart .
he added a little sugar and milk to his tea .
they aren t alone .
we don t know for certain .
tom was charged with drunken driving after he was involved in a car accident in boston .
could you please tell me again why you are late ?
i had met him many times before then .
he will be here soon .
tom hid behind a tree .
i ll make some coffee .
i m going to stay there for about a week .
that s all i was thinking .
how do i thank you ?
he likes being surrounded by young people .
please move to the rear of the bus .
i don t care what you thought .
i d like to sit further back .
i ll give it a shot .
if i had known about it i would have told you .
can i buy you another beer ?
you should have come earlier .
i tried to run fast .
tom has some very good news .
when did he go to europe ?
how come you know all this ?
they are very proud of being students of that college .
can you tell me about that conversation ?
do i look old ?
i tried that .
take the medicine three times a day .
he devoted a lot of time to study .
could you please overlook it this time ?
do not do that .
it s not funny .
i never promised you anything .
we are going to have a baby .
i can t remember how to spell her name .
they worked like bees .
nobody knows it but me .
tom doesn t look pleased .
i think we re getting close .
you re a wonderful guy .
she took over the business after the death of her husband .
she wasn t polite to him .
my mother was usually very busy .
i ve got a meeting at .
science has discovered that there are five types of human beings .
here have a drink .
i d be delighted if that happened again .
i m proud of the work i ve done here .
we were greeted by a cute waitress .
she is very popular among the boys .
why were soldiers lost ?
the more laws the more offenders .
where s your school ?
he became a hobo .
i shouldn t complain .
i m fixing the radio i found on my way home .
he and i are teachers .
we were not invited to the party .
tom complained about the room being too small .
i was absent from the party .
i have been waiting for almost half an hour .
i ll sleep here .
show me an example .
i don t want to see tom again .
let me see .
watch out the man has a gun .
tom despises mary .
can you tell us about it ?
funny i don t remember that .
he stiffed me for fifty bucks .
we were all devastated .
a coat is an article of clothing .
i found it necessary to ask for help .
my father is always forgetting things .
we heard what sounded like gunshots .
he shall have it .
we love what we do .
i want to go to america someday .
we have no one but ourselves to blame for that .
i d like to talk to tom alone .
it will not be long before spring comes .
tom came to boston hoping to find a job .
he s got an uncle who works in a bank .
i think it s obvious .
feed the bird !
you re extroverted .
tom s a beginner but he catches on fast .
i thought i d lost you .
do i have it right ?
i didn t want you to get involved .
let me see it .
are you finished with your work ?
do you mind if i join you ?
she lived to be ninety .
the weather is bad .
we must take into account the fact that she is old .
they were lucky .
i heard a noise in the bedroom .
i d explain it to you but your brain would explode .
i looked for the key .
a triathlon is a forbidding test of endurance .
i think it s time for me to come clean .
i assemble car engines .
i m not deaf .
i am unable to agree on that point .
he helped me carry the baggage .
i just don t want to be reminded of it .
i m firing you .
i haven t finished my breakfast yet .
i find foreign languages very interesting .
you don t know what you re missing .
i respect your opinion .
what did you do last sunday ?
we owe more on our house than it s worth .
can you see tom ?
what are your strong points ?
i feel like someone is watching us .
she caught a cold last night .
do you think the situation will improve ?
is there something in particular that you want to hear ?
we need to be prepared .
it was just as i thought .
how did you get to know her ?
i try to do what i can .
complaining about something doesn t change anything .
do you have other family ?
i believe in the immortality of the soul .
everyone changes .
the desk drawer is open .
the only thing that matters is that you weren t injured .
i m sorry i didn t hear you .
did you go out ?
i couldn t find what i was looking for .
i get dizzy when i stand up .
their rude behavior makes me angry .
she cremated him against his wishes .
here s my account number .
it s very simple .
he walked through the forest .
what are you drinking ?
i never for a moment imagined i d be able to afford to live in such a fancy house .
i m not going to play this game .
i did my best .
my grandmother became sick last week .
you re very forward .
do you ever think about that guy ?
are you content with your present salary ?
you obviously don t have time .
you re in luck . the plane is on time .
she hugged him .
they say they cannot compete with low priced foreign products .
obviously it s not working .
isn t this wonderful ?
tom slammed on the brakes .
how much money did you spend on your car ?
i d help if i could .
that s why i m telling you not to go alone .
you don t have to be so rude .
the audience consisted mainly of students .

i couldn t bring myself to tell her the truth .
i ll pray hard .

tom got into the cab .
if you want something done right you should do it yourself .
no one s watching me .
i don t know why you didn t tell the truth .
don t be crude .
i m going to figure this out .
tom should know that .
he likes oranges .
you never want to give anything away .
that s exactly what i did .
your parents didn t come did they ?

tom is refusing to pay his bills .
in my city there is no school for learning esperanto .

even a loser can dress for success .
a boy came running towards me .

the pain was almost unbearable .
i can t do it today .

my parents hardly ever punished me for anything .
mine is totally different .
let s ask him .
i can wait no longer .
your dreams will come true .
could you please tell me again who your father is ?
i don t know how to handle this .
i always counted you as a friend .
it s a very sad story .
tom promised mary that he d help her .
call me this evening .
cats like playing in the sun .
we re lost .
i ll trust you .
what did i ever do to you ?
tom is overemotional .

i ve never made this kind of mistake before .
it s for you to decide .
i m being held hostage .
don t be so pessimistic .
i ve never had a friend quite like you .
i m not sure i m ready for this .
the roads were empty .
i was asked to wait here .

that would be unfair .
he threw a stone at the dog .

that was really difficult .
someone scratched my car .
they took a walk .
they caught tom .
he won t tell me what happened .
i d like you to cut my hair .
they greeted each other warmly .
you don t seem too surprised .
how s your old lady doing ?
look at this one .
all of the tree s leaves turned yellow .
you re still alive .
he was jealous of my success .
how are you going to deal with it ?
can we just drop it ?
she is a most beautiful lady .
i don t think it s such a bad idea .
subtlety never was your strong suit .
i will never see him .
i don t know really .
i m surprised to see you .
i would like you to come with me .
can you deliver it to my house ?
tom spent the remainder of the night thinking about mary .
i ll go this way .

it didn t go very well .
you ve been warned .
you have too many irons in the fire .
we need action .
you look happy today .

i m looking forward to seeing your father .
i tried again .
democracy encourages freedom .
if you re tired rest .

i never want to see him again .
i ve already done the hard part .
i d like to do an autopsy on this body .
this dictionary isn t mine .
i don t know where he lives .
he plays golf every sunday .
which one is broken ?
it serves you right .
we set up our tents before dark .
i do worry .
houses built with wood burn more easily than houses built out of stone .
take your time when you eat meals .
i m scheduled to have lunch with him .
we heard gunshots from next door .
why are we helping tom ?
i thought that he was honest .
can you keep it a secret ?
tom was sitting alone in his room .
i was present at school yesterday .
i had business to take care of .
he doesn t listen .
did anybody see you ?
tom takes the trash out every day at six o clock .
i had no idea you were involved .
you re too young to marry .
didn t your parents teach you anything ?
you re lazy .
i m not good with names .
i need to make a few calls .
they are in the teachers room .
if you don t hurry you won t get there before dark .
don t be rude .
i am deeply grateful to you for your kindness .
are you saying that you don t want to see me anymore ?
i expected that he would come .
my shoelaces came undone .
do you remember where you left your umbrella ?
i m in danger .
never mind !
i hope to see you again .
you should do that right now .
we re all to blame for that .
i didn t argue .
the dead and wounded soon lay everywhere .
are you enjoying it ?
she likes jazz and so do i .
we had to stop .
the police compared the fingerprints on the gun with those on the door .
i succeeded thanks to his advice .
i do not fear death .
she s asking how that s possible .
i need someone who i can talk to .
that applies to him too .
don t blame me .
is he sleeping ?
i felt very relieved when i heard the news .
please don t speak so fast .

i considered that .

he was about to speak .
they hold me responsible for it .
i ll send you the link .
i don t know who i ll miss more you or your brother .
i rushed out to see what was going on .

you re very wise .
it seems as if you are the first one here .

she asked him questions .
tom doesn t have the will power to quit smoking .
i don t want to lose my boyfriend .
i just keep finding excuses .

she is stubborn .
i m all yours .

i d like to read some books about the beatles .
there are still many things left to do .
i don t want to be your enemy .
tom is much taller than you are .
i put my hand on his shoulder .

i d like to forget the whole thing ever happened .
i just have a lot on my mind .
he was sentenced to death .
i have many talents .

the answer s no .
that s not wrong .
i don t think we can really say that one is right and the other is wrong .
you mean the world to me you really do .
be creative .
what sort of father do you think you ll be ?
there are a lot of people here .
after losing his job he went through a very difficult time .
i m starting to feel desperate .
i worry about my future .

we used to sit on these steps and talk .
you don t have to go .
