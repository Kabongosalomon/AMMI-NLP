these are not sized right . a 3x is always big on me and these r cut wrong ! i ' m returning them . i think they are darling but they are just cut wrong . i got them in a timely fashion . there was no problem with the seller . just an issue with sizing . 
a cool watch to have 
i own several watches , and this is my favorite dress watch . had a breitling before , but it ' s high profile didn ' t work well with my dress shirts . the slim design of the bulova makes this clearly a classic dress watch . 
i am happy with my recent purchase of the bulova men ' s 97b13 black tortoise shell leather strap watch . it was my first purchase of a bulova watch , and is amazed by the size and feel of my watch , 
having read hundreds of reviews of watches on this website i chose this one to add to my collection : - likes : - an elegant and easy to set watch - utterly easy to use and simpledislikes - perhaps too small for anyone with big wrists , the wrist band does not feel like it is high quality 
this is a favorite timepiece . the classic roman numbers on the clean white dial and contrasting black hands make this an all the time watch . i have a breitling navitimer and a vacheron , but the bulova goes everywhere . the calendar is handy on the job . the quartz movement is right on the mark when checked with wwv or the internet site . the leather strap is the right choice for the watch and it completes the classic look and style . i would buy it again and the price is a value . i like the quartz movt . as it is accurate and does not stop during a long rest . the watchcase is nicely styled with the lugs helping the classic look . the crown is small and causes no skin irratation , the calander is quick set and the gold second hand does not get confused with the minute hand . it is winner ! 
this watch looked good in the pictures , the dial is slim , and it is perfectly adequate , but the strap is short and looked cheap upon arrival . not a bad watch , but not great . i ended up returning mine . i would recommend viewing this model in person before buying to make sure you like it . thank god amazon makes returns easy . 
i definitely have loved what bulova has made in watches the past several years . not just the classic design , but how they have stood by the customers on what has made the customers keeping with time . this one is definitely the case with this watch . this brand new bulova men ' s leather watch is definitely a classic and simple design . it definitely improves on what bulova has had before with their basic leather - strapped watches . i definitely recommend this piece a lot , if you are looking for a basic piece that is classic , affordable , and a real steal for anyone who wants a watch that is definitely worth while in a beautiful quartz movement . this bulova watch is definitely worth the money . price : bsetup & quality : b - overall : b 1 / 2 - 
this is my ideal in an elegant watch - - gold ( tone ) case , uncluttered white face , black roman numerals . i have a small wrist and it fits perfectly . yes , the date window is a bit small , but i ' ve found that i rarely need to check the date . 
bought 6 of these for groomsman gift . something i new they wouldn ' t have but every gentleman should have . a dress watch . the only thing i didn ' t like about the watch was the small cheap wrist - band . my wife bought me a silver bulove same style as wedding gift and the band was top notch on mine . the band that comes with these will need to be replaced but the price is great ! 
beautiful watch . very happy with it except for the size . the band and the watch itself are much smaller than i would have guessed from the picture . not the size of a woman ' s watch , but smaller than a typical watch for a man . 
if you are a fan of large face watches , then this product is for you . the watch met all of my expectations and looks great ! a real bargain and highly recommended . 
i ' m buying one more right now , my cousin loved it so much hes gonna pay me 2x the price if i bring him it lol . 
it is a piece of art . i really love this watch ! i am a tall man and i prefer oversized watches and this one is perfect . it comes in a yellow box with a modern desing . 
this watch for the size is very comfortable . if you have a smaller than average wrist you might think twice before purchasing . the back is straight not curved so a larger wrist works best . this watch keeps good time and the chrono functions are easy to operate . at 200 meter w . r . this is a good sport watch . the band is extremely well made for the price ; in fact people will pay as much for a band / strap like this as they would for the watch . a good watch for my collection and i am sure if you get one you will also like it . lots of good fortune and namaste ' 
fast shipping & . great price . nice looking watch and appears very well made . however if you do not want to be noticed don ' t buy this watch , iti a large watch and people will notice it on your wrist right away . it ' s a nice and unusual looking watch that will look best with casual dress . i love it . 
i took a gamble when buying this watch , didn ' t really know if it will suit me , but my gut feeling told me to go for it . i like having stylish watches , and this one sure does have a lot of style . it is huge , but not heavy , the knobs on the side may pinch a bit sometimes to some sensitive people , doesn ' t bother me . the time is really easy to read , needless to explain why . the leather strap is of very good quality and looks great . the color is creamish off whitish going to yellowish side . the material of the metal can be better but at 99 . 99 price by amazon , i will settle for it . it is bit confusing to how to adjust the watch , the manual does not help . after 5 minutes of trying , i found out that the main knob on the side is actually like a screw cap and you can rotate it to remove the screw cap , and then you can use the button underneath it . i don ' t think it is practically too useful as a chronometer or all the sports / activity stuff , but just going for the looks , it does have it going for it . i would not pay full price for it , 99 . 99 is the perfect price for it , anything more would be more . comes in a nice yellow box by invicita , comes with a platinum warranty application which extends the default one year warranty to 5 year , supposedly for amazon . com customer , this upgrade is free , i will find out soon , have submitted my application to invicta . if you like watches , this one is for you . and for all you ladies out there , if you want to make your man happy , give him this as a gift alongwith a nice cigar . he will surely appreciate it . 
first things first , this watch is huuuuuuuuuuge , in my opinion , too huge ( except you ' re over 6 ' 9 " and 250lb ) . that ' s not the problem , the problem is that the watch looks cheap . the pull out crown it ' s tricky and take a while to adjust the hour . if this watch were a little bit smaller it would be ok . the chronograph function is ok and works well . the packaging is amazing . the price is great for what you get . if you want to be noticed , this is the right watch for you . 
i really like this invicta chronograph watch . it has a very attractive dial , and nice band and it is big . the face of this watch , while advertised as white , looks like a pale yellow to me . nevertheless , whatever the color , the face does stand out , not only because of its color but because it is so big - about 2 1 / 8 inches both height and width . this watch is a chronograph , and there are two sub dials on the face . i like the position of these dials , with the seconds dial being on the top and the minutes being on the bottom of the dial . however , whenever the second , and to a lesser degree the hour hand are anywhere from the 53 minute mark to the 8 minute mark , the second hand for the chronograph is obscured . i really do not find it that annoying , but they do obstruct the view . this happens , to a lesser degree on the bottom dial because the minutes do not move , or are needed as much , as the second hand . the face also has a date window at the 3 o ' clock position , and it is oversized so i can see both the date before and the date after . convenient for someone like me that can never remember what the date is on any given day . this black leather band is nice , and is has white stitching going along each edge . i think this really helps bring out the color ( whatever it might be ) of the face . the case is all brushed metal and i like how it complements the entire watch . this watch has a japanese quartz movement , so i was curious as to how accurate it was , so i tested it against the atomic clock in colorado over a period of 24 hours . i found that this watch was fast by 2 seconds over this time period , which means for each month , i have to set my watch back by a minute . i do not think that is bad for this japanese movement , but i am not sure how it would hold up against a precise swiss movement . this watch kind of overpowers my wrist , but i like it nonetheless . 
to buy this gorgeous watch ! i love gold and silver combined . the colors are beautiful . this watch is very classy . i went to macy ' s and had 3 links removed for free . 
i bought this for my mom for mother ' s day . it was a great gift ! classy but not too flashy ! it was just exactly what i was looking for . the face isn ' t huge which is the style now , big face watches are in but of course my mom is more conservative so she loved it ! ! i ' m very happy that she loved it ! ! great purchase and it came just in time : ) 
this is a stylish watch ; it looks very delicate , and at the same time it ' s very easy to read ( it has the numbers ) the big plus for me : it has a second hand . most of the nice watches i saw were missing the second hand , until i found this one . the bracelet has two colors which goes with all the outfits . the bracelet comes long , but it ' s very easy to adjust ( my husband did it ) . i used to have a bulova caravelle ( same size , with second hand ) , and this new bulova it ' s a perfect replacement ! highly recommend it . and amazon delivered it very fast ! 
this is a gift for my mom on mother ' s day . watches have always been a fancy for women and they consider it as a fashion accessory . this particular piece i picked from amazon the bulova women ' s white patterned bracelet watch is definitely a jewel . the metal strap comes in a bi - metal design a blend of silver and gold in the shape of tiny hearts . the dial is oval in shape to add grace to the uniquely designed strap . another worthwhile feature of the watch is that it comes in full arabic numerals which is hard to find and this gives it a classic look . to top it all the watch is both scratch and water resistant . 
we have hunted for a while to find a replacement for my wife ' s similar watch that she has worn for years . 
this might be ok for junk collectors , but if you are a diver or if you want this watch for everyday use , forget about this , this is chinese junk with a swiss name and believe me not even for 100 dollars or even 20 dollars this piece of junk is worth the money . 
my 3rd grand diver and probably won ' t be my last . grand divers have many outstanding features that make them a desirable want . screw down crown with mechanical wind function is an awesome feature . 
this is the third watch in this series that i have bought and like the previous two , it is top notch ! it keeps accurate time and feels well made and substantial on the wrist ; very much a & # 34 ; man ' s timepiece & # 34 ; delivery to the uk was prompt via royal mail . thoroughly satisfied and highly recommended , especiallt at this price ! ! ! ! ! 
the standard 8926 is listed in invicta ' s 2008 catalog as having a 43mm diameter and this 3044 is listed as having a 47mm diameter crown , which doesn ' t seem like much difference , just 4mm . well , the 4mm makes a huge difference . the images in invicta ' s catalog don ' t come close to showing how big the face of this watch is , compared to the standard 8926 . also with the bigger face , the luminous hour markers are bigger than those on the 8926 , making the face brighter and easier to read in the dark . the bracelet is scaled bigger too , compared to the bracelet on the 8926 , 22mm vs 20mm . the hinge on the bracelet is a precision made hinge instead of the stamped sheet hinge of the 8926 . the exhibition case back , as on the 8926 , is a nice touch for us automatic watch fans . the watch has a diving helmet on the face and band . the invicta name is prominent on the face , side of the case and clasp . the scalloped edge bezel similar to an omega . it is a pretty watch on it ' s own , styled much like classic swiss diving watches . the automatic movement , especially with the viewing window on the back of the case , is for us old school automatic watch enthusiasts . being an automatic it will not keep time as precise as a quartz watch . i have found mine to be one minute per week fast , which is acceptable for an automatic for me . i was looking for an automatic diver with a big easy to read face , classic styling , reasonably priced , this works for me . 
i just love this grand diver , it ' s not heavy to me but for some smaller folks it ' s maybe to heavy for them . it fit my wrist just fine . great price point for a automatic watch this big . 
my son - in - law was very pleased to receive this watch as a gift . however none of the adults present could rotate the outer rim as the directions instructed to get it to pop up and then proceed with the setting process . the band is quite large and has to have at least 4 links removed so hopefully a jeweler can assist with the initial set up of the watch . i was a little disappointed that it was so complicated to set but since the band was so large it couldn ' t be worn immediately . 
this is my second automatic grand diver and i love it . i ' ve always wanted one but i wanted a good one ; you really have to look at an automatic grand diver up close to appreciate their beauty and their craftsmanship . the grand divers ' do seem to be underpriced for how well they ' re put together . the glass display on back adds a nice touch of elegance , and the engine inside does appear to wind in both directions ! the screw down crown with mechanical wind hack function was found to be an unbelievable surprise . i have a 9 inch wrist which is why i bought a grand diver as so many others seem to fall short at the eight inch mark for me . i will have to remove a link or two on this watch but that ' s nothing ; it will fit a person with a wrist larger than 9 inches . the second hand glides nicely across the dial and everything is highly polished . the royal blue color is a true and deep royal blue . the deepness of the blue is similar to the ones seen on many high end luxury watches , meaning it doesn ' t look purple . overall , i ' m really becoming a huge fan of this line . 
i got this to replace a non - automatic diver as i expand my collection . it ' s definitely diver - sized ( read : oversized ) , so if you want something not so hulkish , look elsewhere . i recently picked up a citizen bn0000 - 04h , which is much smaller if that ' s your thing . as far as this invicta , it ' s now my favorite to take in the water ( i ' m still keeping my overall fav diver , the orange monster , on land ) . the rest of my divers have rubber straps , which i love , but the bracelet works well on this watch , adding to the heft . it took a week in the ocean unscathed and i ' m hoping it lasts for a long time to come . the rolex - like cyclops eye over the date is a nice addition and the lume works well . 
an excellent watch that keeps very accurate time . delivered in secure packaging by amazon . it looks great and would definitely recommend . presently looking at other models in this series . 
i ' ve had this watch for over a week and have to say the level of quality for the price ( $ 108 ) is astounding . keeps great time , high quality parts and very stylish . received a number of compliments on the watch . definitely would buy again and get the sapphire crystal . can ' t go wrong if you are looking for high quality in a low cost package . 
when it has came down to invicta , they definitely have been the quality leader in making great watches over the years , not just in demand , but class and innovation . they have made some really great automatic watches for the past several years , but the demand of their great timepieces has definitely exploded over the past years . but for anyone that wants a over - sized timepiece without worry about the price , this is definitely one i recommend . this pro diver grand diver automatic is a great timepiece that is simple and easy to take care of . what i honestly love abut this piece isn ' t just the style , but the blue face and excellent illumination of the watch . what i do though wish was that this piece would be a bit easier to open and close with the safety lock . it can be uncomfortable , and the unidirectional bezel can stick a bit . but nevertheless , thi is a good watch to get for anyone that wants a bulky automatic , without the waste of price . price : bsetup & comfort : b - overall : b 1 / 2 - 
i love the blue color dial face on this classic style heavy duty diver ' s watch . the all stainless steel band and case with screw - down crown are great . i like that the watch is water resistance rating to 300 meters and that it is a 21 - jewel automatic movement . this is a heavy duty watch , but feels really great on your arm . 
this is a very nice looking watch . it looks like the quality timepiece that it is . it ' s got the heft to prove that it ' s built from solid , surgical - grade stainless steel . it ' s a cinch to operate , you just set the time once and it ' s self winding ( no battery , but powered by wrist movements ) - but you have to wear it , since if you let it sit for a few days it slows down . ( note that it comes big , so unless you ' ve got enormous forearms , you ' ll need to take it to a jeweler to fit it , or adjust it yourself like i did after looking up how to do it online ; even though i have large wrists i had to remove two of the links before i could adjust this to fit just right . ) the crown locks down , which helps ensure the water resistance . you just unscrew it and pull it out to set the time and date . it ' s bare bones as far as features go , but that adds to the elegant simplicity . there ' s no alarm clock , no calculator , no digital timer , no multiple time zones . it just tells the time and the date , and the rotating bezel allows you use it as a timer ( just rotate it to line up with the minute hand and wait until it reaches a deadline up to sixty minutes ) . i have to say , i ' m not a pro diver . i don ' t ever expect to wear this underwater to 300 meters . i use it to tell time - and i don ' t always wear it since it is a bit heavy . you do feel its weight when you wear it , which is kind of cool , but could be a bit of a distraction for everyday use . i think of it more like a useful ornament that i ' ll wear when i dress up . for most days , i ' ve got a much less expensive plastic digital watch with some of the frills they decided - probably wisely - that for the purposes of this watch were just not necessary . 
the invicta grand diver 3045 is a very large , solid watch . i think they made them specifically for football players and navy seals . you ' ll see what i mean if you take a look at the picture i ' ve attached of my husband wearing it - he ' s 6 ' 3 " and 185 pounds . he put it on and mentioned the need to start weight lifting . the silvery blue of the watch face is brilliant and very eye - catching . this is definitely a sporty watch , and you wouldn ' t wear it with any kind of business or formal clothing . i look at this watch and the feel is one of wearing it out on a boat with blue waters and bright sunlight and . . . the person wearing it is alex o ' loughlin of hawaii five - o . the funny thing is that daniel dae kim wears one that is more in line with this watch . see pics on imdb from hawaii five - o . the luminous phosphorescent glow on this watch is wonderful . it does run a few seconds fast in a day . all in all , a beefy watch ! 
it is expensive looking and feels the same . i am a collector . i am glad i got this one . impressive 
this is my 4th invicta watch . it is a very nice time piece ; however , when i called invicta to inquire about the size they noted that it was the same as the 8926 automatic . it actually is not , so there web site ( invicta ) was incorrect . it ' s pretty sad when the manufacturer does not have the accurate information . the watch has more of a purple versus blue background ; however , it is a nice look . invicta also notes that this is a mako swiss . the watch is made in japan and does not have any notes or swiss markings . the case back requires a special tool to remove it and change the battery . overall it is a nice time piece ; however , i only gave it a 4 primarily because of the invicta inaccuracies and lack of customer service that they are known for . 10 - 8 - 09 update ; i had to change the battery in this watch . i opened the back and was shocked when i saw that the inner ring that holds the movement in place was made of cheap white plastic . i could not believe how cheap the interior of this watch was . if i could return it i would in a heart beat . the watch should be on a shelf at wal - mart for under $ 10 . 00 . very disappointed . 
on the good side , this is a very , very handsome watch - - i get lots of compliments ( even from rolex owners ) . the gold plating is nicely done . to my surprise the gold - plated band really does feel different than stainless - - it is softer on the skin and feels warmer . the invicta 8937 has proven to be very waterproof . i use it for swimming , sailing , jet - skiing . so the screw - down crown does its job . ok , here ' s my complaints . the watch is a terrible time - keeper . when it runs for 24 hours straight , it will lose about 1 . 5 to 2 . 0 minutes per day . but what ' s worse , it will , once or twice a week , simply stop running ( even while on my wrist ) . usually it stops at night , but i ' ve had it stop in the middle of the day . to prevent this i now manually wind the watch every morning and when i go to bed . that will usually ( but not always ) keep it running . as for the poor time - keeping , i know it could be regulated , but i don ' t feel like spending $ 50 to fix an $ 80 . 00 watch . my strong recommendation - - get the invicta model 9312 with swiss quartz movement instead . it looks identical to the model 8937 ( though the 9312 is slightly thinner and lighter in weight ) . i also own a model 9312 and it is amazingly accurate . i ' ve set and checked my invicta 9312 with the web atomic time clock . the 9312 has not lost or gained one second in two weeks . amazing . the 9312 is without a doubt the most accurate time piece i own . the only reason i can see for getting the model 8937 is if you absolutely need the screw - down crown . unfortunately invicta no longer offers a screw - down crown with the model 9312 , which , in all other respects , is a better watch . 
i purchased this watch for my father . he was thrilled with it and told all his friends at the living facility it was a gift from me . he recently passed away so i inherited it back , but it still brings back great memories of his response when i gave it to him . 
this is the best 80 dollar watch i ever had . i have had several that were over 200 dollars and i think this one is better than those also . it ' s a handsome watch . i have small wrists and it looks just right on my arm . i had to go to a local jeweler and have 2 links removed from the bracelet . it was right after christmas and she either felt charitable or sorry for me so she did it for free . it took her less than a minute . it is keeping very good time . as for people that complain about the magnifying bubble over the date , i like it because i hate squinting to see the date . the blue dial and outside minute bezel are beautiful . i own a whole drawer full of watches and this is my favorite . until i buy another invicta of course . it comes in a nice ( huge ) yellow leatherette box with a soft cloth to polish it up with . it would make a very attractive gift . i prefer that is a battery watch as i have no experience with an automatic and don ' t wear one often enough to keep it wound . 
i want to say that this is not a poor quality watch . i don ' t get all the complaints of poor quality with invicta watches . i have several of them and haven ' t had the least problem with any of them . this watch is only $ 64 and while it certainly isn ' t on the level of a tag or rolex it is far above the quality of anything else out there in this price range . my only complaint about this watch is the size of the face . while i don ' t like the ' mega face ' trend watch makers are tending towards these days , this one is goes a little too far in the other direction . in fact when i opened the box i have to say i was a little shocked and thought i had ordered a women ' s watch by mistake . but if you can live with that this is a really great looking and well made watch for well under $ 100 . 
i wear the size small with socks . i have it in a few colors now . it feels like a cloud . i actually choose it to wear at home intead of my slippers because they are more comfortable and comforting . corrdinate them with clothes and wear matching socks and they are less conspicious . they are really great because they feel like a cloud . the soles are non skid so they feel really safe . i am not a vegan , but know that vegans struggle with non leather choices and think now the finally have something that works for them that feels good . i hear men choose black or brown to wear with kackis . i think these are a great breakthru . if your feet hurt like mine you will love these . if you are lucky and you can wear high fashion shoes you are lucky . if you hurt this could open a world of comfort to you . try the differnt models and styles because they fit differently . this size did not fit my mom and like i said the cayman looks similar but does not fit me . i looked on the crocs official web site and the have higher fashion ones in additon a rx line that is a medical line . i am going to try some of the dress crocs and see . oh i reviewed some microfiber chenille socks and that is what i like to wear with my crocs . crocs makes their own socks but they say cros all over them and i do not like logos . 
i ' ve seen these clogs worn by others for several years now but could never find them in my size ( 14w ) . well , thank you amazon ! not only in my size but priced well below many others and in stock ! they were delivered promptly , are true to size and fit perfectly . i use them as my " in - house " shoes and they are the best . the most comfortable slippers i have ever owned . now i know why the crocs products are so successful . i would recommend them to anyone . as a matter of fact , my wife just purchased a pair of crocs for herself . 
i bought my first pair of crocs while recovering from neck surgery over two years ago . i was really looking for some walking shoes so i could exercise in the mall . well , the crocs were on display so i tried them on . cheap , lightweight and oh , so comfortable . i figured they would last a few months and they would get tossed but , so what ? well i ' ve worn that original pair for all this time and i ' ve been using them this summer for my yard work . i hose them off and leave them by the back door . they ' ve gotten beat up and they ' re now pretty worn looking but they are still comfortable and still practical for a yard shoe . of course , they ' re goofy - looking in all those electric colors and that funky toe shape . not an issue for me . these things are as comfortable as birkenstock sandals and clogs but cost considerably less . they ' re so cheap , i don ' t mind abusing them . and they take the abuse and only need a quick hosing down to be clean and ready for more abuse . since that original pair , i ' ve bought two more . one pair is kept by the front door and one in the rv . i just ordered two more pair from amazon on sale . i can always justify comfortable shoes . 
i bought these as to replace another pair i had to use as a basic summer shoe to wear around when shopping , etc . . . wonderful , comfy shoes . 
i ordered these while deployed , as shower shoes . i had to walk across rough , golfball size rocks to get to the shower . it was tearing through my cheap flip flops . i used these daily and never experienced any noticeable wear and tear . for a durability , i give these a 5 of 5 . if you need them for something similar , i recommend . if you are going for fashion , please do not wear crocs 
my wife got a pair of these crocs and absolutely loved them so i figured i would give them a try and i purchased a pair myself . they are the most comfortable shoe to wear . they look nice , they hold up well , they are so light and they massage your feet while you walk because they have all these little bubbles inside . i purchase them before we went on vacation and loved them because they can get wet or anything and can ' t hurt them . you really need to try a pair of crocs . you won ' t be disappointed . 
crocs " beach clog " model is just as awesome as the " specialist " model which i love so much . this model averages $ 23 and may be the model so many people think about when they say crocs are ugly . i have news for you , but you should believe your own eyes : crocs are not ugly . no matter how ugly you may think they are , once you try on a pair , you will never want to take them off - guaranteed . this model as you see is riddled with swiss - cheese - style holes . it ' s good ventilation for summer , but i think you ' ll be pretty hot under the collar if it rains . that cold rain gets into these holes faster than spinach into popeye ! yet crocs , made of a unique material known as croclite , are in my opinion the finest and most brilliant shoes ever manufactured . sturdy design , functionality , practicality , a comfortable fit that will make at least your feet think they ' ve died and gone to foot heaven . . . it ' s all here . and anyone who says they are ugly is an insulting , insensitive and tasteless snot . let me just say these shoes will take a beating and then some . you ' ll barely notice any wear on the soles . they love all feet and all styles of socks - or no socks . got them stained or dirty ? wash them off in the bath or shower , it ' s that simple . comfort , go - almost - anywhere ( i know a guy who wears his black crocs to funerals but i would not do it ) , toss - them - anyplace , last forever , and no they are not ugly . these spectacular shoes lured me away from my decades of wearing okabashi sandals . . . they are that comfortable . not too worried about cold feet , then wear these in winter . perfect year - round and you won ' t believe how cool they are in the summer heat . these will be the last mules , clogs , driving moccasins or loafers you ' ll ever really want to buy . you may buy more , you may buy other types of shoes too - but these things will make you fall in eternal love . crocs : you only think they ' re ugly . wait til you wear them . otherwise , you can ' t pass up the chance to own a couple of pairs of this style . it is comfort , good support , ease of maintenance , hard - wearing , and you will find your color and size , just read the options carefully . crocs : they ain ' t ugly , they ' s snappy ! 
this is my third pair . i ' m a crocs fan . i have foot problems ( long story ) but crocs give me some needed room . i can ' t advise about too big or too small , but since i live in japan , i put on and take off shoes many times a day . with out the heel straps these make great slip - ons . i also have some of the no strap type ( without vent holes on the sides that i use in the ( often ) rain . they aren ' t as good for driving because the tend to slip off during stop an go driving . even so , i wear my crocs even in winter , ( one size up to accommodate thicker socks ) and my feet don ' t get any colder than they did with other shoes . for me , crocs are tops . 
so comfortable , lightweight and convenient . now i ' ve graduated to crocs malindi . they ' re my " dress " crocs . i highly recommend ! ! 
i love my crocs . i have two colors and want more . i wear them as slippers , sandals , shoes . . . allll the time ! i think they look great with almost all casual wear . they are so comfy and don ' t make your feet smell like you might think . they can be tossed in the wash if they get dirty and they come out like new . i find myself not wanting to wear any other shoe . 
as everyone by now should know , classic crocs will perform great . nice to wear near the pool . 
as a woman with large , hard - to - fit feet ( 12ish , and wide ) and a variety of minor health complaints , it ' s hard to find shoes that are in my size , don ' t hurt any part of my body , and are not as expensive as a houseboat . people have their complaints about crocs , but i have found nothing better , and i have nearly a dozen pairs stashed in my closet now , for fear that one day the supply might dry up and i would be left sole - less again . i love that they are available in crazy colors , too - - " grape " is my current favorite . after years of being told " maybe you can find something in the men ' s department " or being pointed toward grey nun - like oxfords while other women could wear whatever they wanted , it ' s at least something of a consolation prize . 
my mom destroys all her casual footwear in the garden and i ' ve been promising her a pair of gardening shoes for ages . this one fits the bill perfectly . she wears her crocs every day , says they ' re very comfortable , and a quick spray with the hose gets rid of the mud and dust . no more ruined sneakers and flats - i hope ! 
this may be an ugly shoe but it has saved my feet a couple of times . for some reason bumping my toe causes my whole foot to swell and i ' m unable to walk on it for 2 to 3 months . this show has saved me . i will continue to wear . 
i love them , they were here earlier then expected . right size , right color . right everything . . . . i highly recommend . 
my husband wanted a pair of crocs for an upcoming fishing trip . i purchased the xl for him as he ' s a size 10 1 / 2 - 11 . they fit him perfectly and the color is just right ( khaki ) . so far so good . . . . . the crocs were put to use on a recent fishing trip and worked great . 
i wear these everyday . they are very comfortable and durable . i am very pleased . when these wear out , i plan to buy another pair . 
i used to have a pair of flip flops for the casual outdoor outing - to the nearby store or to the beach or for the quick after hours trip to my office to pick something up . the problem was they weren ' t very comfortable between the toes , and they didn ' t last very long . this time i went with a pair of black crocs , and they ' re ideal for the casual and quick outdoor trip . perfect for the beach ; great for grocery shopping . i like that i can just slip my feet in and be off . not so good for hiking or travelling or even just days out walking downtown , i think . they don ' t quite have the comfort and support level of , say , a birkenstock . the contoured plastic of the inner sole feels fine for a few hours but can be irritating after several . if i walk very long or very far , i find myself needing to take them off and give my foot a rest . still , the price is right and the feel is great for occasional spontaneous use - and that ' s exactly why i own them . my kids have colorful crocs and love them - they wear them everywhere except to school . i love that they have them , too , since i like to make spontaneous trips to the beach or to the park and having these means they can throw them on and we ' re out . no need to search for socks or to tie shoes . i hadn ' t been able to find them in my size ( 15 ) until i saw them for sale here and quickly ordered a pair . 
i like pink . these crocs were salmon colored . i use them but would have preferred a different color . still they are comfy and make it easy to get up and go . 
i have a narrow foot and if i get them long enough , they fall off my feet , but i bought these for my son who is a big man with a wide foot and he wears them all the time . he has them in every color , even pink , and takes the ribbing in good humor . he has terrible painful foot problems and couldn ' t care less what people way . he wears them for coaching baseball and just about everything else except work . 
i love my beach crocs . i have a little nerve damage under the ball of each foot , and these are the most comfortable shoes to wear . also , this model is ideal for people with a wide forefoot , unlike the cayman which is more narrow . 
i bought this shoe as a result of a recommendation from a lady in my physical therapy session . this shoe offers an extremely soft foot bed , which wonderful for sore or injured feet , as mine are . however , it ' s frustrating that the " crocs " company doesn ' t offer this shoe in definitive women ' s sizes . i had to purchase it in " mens 6 , women ' s 8 " , and it ' s much too wide and makes my feet look as though they ' re from the jurassic era . i wear them though , because it ' s the only shoe i can wear until my feet and tendon heal . 
they have really big bumps and lots of them inside . then the raised part under the toes is not too comfortable for someone with uncommon foot shapes . they are probably really good once you get used to them . i just looked inside the worn - out pair i have . they are smoother . i think they vary in the interiors quite a bit . i bought a pair of these , but returned them due to them being too bumpy . mine are so old now , i don ' t know what they were like new . 
i love my crocs . ive had them for years and they ' re still good . they ' re comfortable and last a long time 
these shoes are soooo comfortable . the sock is padded like sneakers , good support and cushioning , etc . but come on , the uppers are a mix of synthetic and the lowest possible grade of leather , which is basically just synthetic with a layer of ground up leather dust glued together underneath . they look it too . maybe you could get away with it in black , but the brown , which was more reddish , just looked to cheap to be seen in . dear stags used to be cheap , but acceptable , the kind of shoes you would wear if you had to look decent but be on your feet . but these are just beyond the pale , and considering they very close in price to much better shoes while being closer in quality to payless , i ' m not sure why anyone would buy these . 
amazon ' s deer stags men ' s times plain toe oxford shoe is a sharp , high quality , hard - to - find wide width shoe . unfortunately , my son needed an extra - wide shoe , so we regrettably had to return the pair . we were very disappointed to have to do so . the cushioned interior sole and sturdy exterior sole made it an all around comfortable fitting and attractive shoe . 
at my age , i do believe i am getting " wiser " , i turned 57 this past january , and i needed a new pair of comfortable work / casual shoes , so i was watching several brands and styles , having purchase a pair of deer stags about two years ago and are in still in very good condition i came across this shoe . i noticed there were limited quantities in my size ( 10m ) , but there also was a " used " pair in stock . the box ( packaging ) was damaged but the shoes were perfect ! i paid over half price , and i think now i would have paid 3 times the price , as these shoes are strong , sold and so comfortable . you know the saying " walking on a cloud " , well it fits ! these shoes are wonderful , maybe that ' s why they only have a few left in my size ? ? ya think ? buy a pair and prove me wrong ! 
great , comfortable shoes . i ' ve used a few pairs of these for about the last 4 years and wouldn ' t trade them for anything . 
i purchased these shoes for my 17 year ld son . he usually wears a size 14 but he said they were too small . so i went up a size to 15 . the size 15 were way too big but overall the quality is perfect for a 17 year old that will not wera them very often . 
i have been searching for years to find a pair of deer stags plain toe oxfords in size 14 . it is difficult to find any shoes in a size 14 here in rural oregon , the few that i do find are poorly made , ugly , and expensive . certain that i was doomed to a string of $ 75 - $ 150 that were too small , ugly , and needing replacement in 6 months , i logged onto amazon and was astounded to find these for less than $ 30 . i had a pair of these before and they lasted and looked good for constant use through 5 years , 6 moves and 2 states . these are the most comfortable and durable shoe of this type that i have ever owned . 
i bought this as a dress , church , or interview shoe . it is one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes i ' ve tried . ( i have purchased many rockports and several sas ' s in the past ) . i ' ve worn them about 50 times since i ' ve bought them and they ' ve never disappointed me . it has a matte glossy finish . even after a year , the shoes look great and i haven ' t had to polish them yet . even though my pair feels about a half - size too big , i don ' t mind at all as it is still very comfortable . i will likely buy another pair , but will try it a half size smaller . 
because i wear a size 15 , i normally have to pay about 70 dollars for work shoes , so it is very nice to be able to get a pair of these for 36 dollars . the shoes arrived in good condition , fit perfectly , and are very comfortable . per the picture , these shoes came in the perfect shade of mahogany which matched my tie and belt exactly . i am very pleased with this purchase , and will probably purchase another pair the next time i need some cheap dress shoes . 
i had problems with the sole coming apart on one shoe . then the leather would get the worst scratches and gouges from nothing . the leather was to soft for shoes , almost no durability . 
my husband had a pair of these he bought years ago . . . we found the brand on his worn out pair and ordered these . he said they are wonderful and the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn . he has a wide foot and trouble with other brands ! 
i ' m very pleased with these shoes . since i wear a size 16 , i am somewhat limited in my choices . i lucked out with this one . 
this is the 3rd pair of these that i have gotten , and each has been a positive experience . they last over a year , when worn daily . i never needed to polish them . the shine on these stays , and when scuffed , simple rubbing with a cloth or paper towel gets the shine back . these are waterproof as well , for everyday use , even those that doesn ' t seem to be advertised anywhere . great value for $ 50 or less . 
i have several different styles of deer stags . this is my second pair of this style . i would rate this pair of shoes as one of the most comfortable i have ever worn , and that includes althetic shoes . i could walk all day in these . my previous pair have held up very well . time will tell if this new pair is up to the same standards as the last pair . 
got these to replace some dockers i ordered where the sizing was off . the sizing on these is perfect , i actually have two pair , black and brown . these are definitely a reddish brown , but that ' s what i was looking for . they ' re mostly comfortable to walk in as well . my only minor gripe is that for a lot of walking , i can feel the side rub my ankle a bit . if i go out during lunch for a 30 - minute walk or so it ' s a tag uncomfortable , but only on my ankle and only in the one spot , but no blisters or long - lasting discomfort or anything . oh , and at the lace holes , there ' s some slight discoloration on the leather where the holes were punched , it ' s a little lighter , almost pinkish , but not really noticeable . overall i really like these shoes and would gladly get them again . 
got these for my son who just wanted a basic dress shoe . these were perfect and the price was good . 
i purchased a pair for my son as a birthday gift last march . he asked for another pair , i asked if there was something wrong with the first pair . he said absolutely not , i just want a second pair . it was a christmas gift and he was pleased 
i picked up another pair of shoes from this same brand and i preferred it much better than this one . it ' s much more shinier than the picture , which is a turn off for me . the shine makes it look rather cheap , like it ' s made out of plastic ( the description says it ' s leather but i doubt it ) . had it not been for that , i might have rated it a 4 star . 
these are great to wear in the summer with clogs to keep your feet from getting sweaty and rubbing on the inside of your shoes . they stay on well , and are a good length for the clogs that i have . 
ok , so a foot fetishist designed this , yes ? i just could not get them to stay on my feet , but i should have known that before i bought them . i believe they are in the trash now , but i should point out , i have big ole feet , and if yours are not , perhaps these will be just the ticket . 
as the peda bella ones . they ' re very cushy , these kind of shrink up and i don ' t know what ' s up with the dots . they ' re made out of some polyester / cotton stuff or something and i prefer my socks as cotton as possible . also , you need to wash them in a lingerie bag - all the half socks ! or you will never , ever see them again . the washer thinks they are very juicy indeed . 
i found these by accident when ordering some mules / clogs . love the idea . covering for the front of the foot , open on the heel where the clog / mule is open . not sure if they will be ' slippery ' or not . . . i haven ' t worn or washed them yet . definitely need a lingerie bag , or hand wash . . . 
these are comfy . helps feet from sweating a lot and shoe does not smell so bad as with bare feet . 
they do fit well but i always feel awkward when something just covers my toes . given the way i walk it can slip a bit when feet are sweaty . 
ample size ( i wear a 9 1 / 2 shoe ) , shoe goes on easily over it , footsie stays on all day without slipping due to little anti - slip pads , well constructed . all in all a good buy for a reasonable price . 
i found footies many years ago at macy ' s but could not find more . so when i saw these on amazon i was thrilled . i find they work so for me as i can not go with out some sock in sandals or shoes . 
they fit great . i had doubts that they would stay in place but they worked great . i would like more choice of colors . 
i purchased a pair of these half foot socks and my friend fell in love with them so i had to order a pair for her . they are great for shoes that have no backs to them and you would like to put something to cover your toes . it makes wearing the backless shoes more comfortable . 
excellent for those who hate socks but need half cover on their feet for those hard to wear shoes . my sister wears them around the house because sock are too hot . great fit , good quality , wash well and holds color . they cost more than some other socks of this type but i am very happy with this purchase . i got what i paid for . not easy to find in stores so i order from amazon . 
my high schoolers uses these toe socks during dance class . if i remember right , they have a cotton / poly blend and hold up well . 
i love love these - i ' ve ordered them 2 or 3 times now , to stock up on them . i have a bunch of ankle booties that are cut low enough on the heel that even & # 34 ; no show & # 34 ; socks still show . this is the perfect solution , protect and cover your toes without showing . it helps keep shoes from getting smelly and rubbing on your toes . 
i received these half - socks a few days ago . i haven ' t had the chance to wear / use them yet . i ' ll update my review later , but i can say , they are nice quality socks , and they seem to be well - made . i wear a & # 34 ; true & # 34 ; women ' s size 10 medium shoe and they fit me just fine . the sock isn ' t too short or too long ( they won ' t show , when you are wearing a mule type shoe ) , my only reservation , they do not have any type of skid resistance bottom . so , will they slip and slide around during the course of a day ? i ' m not sure yet . if they do , i ' ll post an update soon . 
this skirt really looks nice i love the style . . how ever . . . it doesn ' t fit true to size . . i am a size 16 regular . . i purchased a xl . and its too tight . . i do not feel like exchanging it because they do not have a xxl . i will try to loose some inches so that it can fit . . overall pretty skirt . . . but disappointment in terms to size 
i received this skirt months ago and am now just getting around to the review . it fits perfectly and the look is unique and a " head turner . " everyone compliments me on this . the bottom camouflage part is wispy and floats like a dream . you will love this skirt and the sizing is perfect . 
it fits a little to big also the top of skirt rolls up does not stay flat and i don ' t have a tummy , other then that just love the skirt . looks like the picture you can wear it with flip flops are boots 
this skirt was surprisingly cute and fit really well . i bought a large and am fairly curvy and loved it . 
i usually wear an 11 / 12 ( l ) , and the skirt in large fit me perfectly . it ' s a nice length . i ' m 5 ' 6 & # 34 ; and it hits mid - shin . the material is sturdy and not see - through . the zipper , however , is a bit on the cheap side and it doesn ' t work very well , 
i love this skirt . size is good . i wore it to dinner and got several remarks on how nice it was . i would recommend this product . 
i bought these for the wife for an occasional fun night out and boy does she love them . she says they make her feel naught but safe . i love them just because i know she ' s wearing them . certainly spiced our life up . . . . 
delicately made , and very soft to the touch . the pink lace up is very very hott ! they barely hide what you are not trying to hide anyways . 
the product is very cute but is on the small side , so buy a size or two larger than you normally would ! 
i ordered a plus size 1x / 2x due to the reviews i read and i regret it . i have to admit this is very sect and very cute but its a shame that its too big ! ! but i contact them and they were very nice and helpful and said i can either return it for a refund or exchange it for a smaller size if available . of course i ' m going to exchange it for a large because these just look so cute and sexy to wear on those special nights . 
but sort of baggy , i wear size 14 jeans and got the 1x due to the size chart but i could have gotten my reg large and they would have been perfect . no need to go up a size 
wife would prefer if the & # 34 ; crotch strings & # 34 ; would stretch for comfort . sexy when wearing , the strings in the back can be loosened , but the does help the comfort . 
it ' s really hard for bigger girls to find sexy pieces that are flattering but this piece works great ! i feel pretty and sexy in these . the lace is a bit scratchy but i ' d say it ' s worth it if you ' re trying to find something to spice it up with your man . 
so after reading all the reviews i thought ok they will fit good i will order the 3 - 4x well . . they fit but a little tight . they are super sexy and the husband loved them but wish they were a tad bigger . i am a size 22 / 24 about 300 lbs soooo im no small lady lol but i do like how they make you feel ! : ) 
even with the belt thing the thigh highs were like knee highs . i was constantly pulling them up , which of course gave then a big fat run from top on to toes . probably be fine for a night in but not a night out . 
i am waiting to wear them in feburary for valientines day , they will look great with my dress and my boots . 
about it being plus sized . maybe it ' s just my lack of knowledge but these seemed quite a bit larger than other nylons that i had bought for the same partner . as the size was not agreeable , she never really wore them and i can not comment on how they wore . 
my girlfriend wore them once , although they were flattering they stretched out and became loose around the lace top . she threw them away . as they were cheep i ' m not disappointed but my girlfriend was 
got these in beige . gotta say that they are a little bit too big for a queen size , even though i have pretty full legs , i am short , and they feel like they would look better if i was taller . the material is very - very soft . 
i love these earing cg more of themuffs i ware them constantly every day im planning on buyin thank you 
i love how these look on my ear . however i apparently have smaller than average ears or maybe oddly shaped ears , as i ' ve had trouble finding a spot where the cuffs will stay in place without having to adjust them to grip so tightly they make my ears sore . in anyone has any tips on how to wear these comfortably , please let me know , because i really do like them ! i ' ve bought from silver insanity before and as always they are an a + seller with good prices , quick shipping , and quality merchandise . i don ' t blame them for my trouble with the earrings - it ' s just my weird ears ! i will buy from them again . 
these are great , small , but quite noticeable . stay on very well and still gives a classic look . i wasn ' t sure if these were still around , they were the " big thing " in the 80 ' s , but today , anything goes , and they look very good dressed up or dressed down . i actually love them . 
these are perfect . they fit like a glove on my upper ear cartilage . comfortable and snug , yet i can ' t even feel them there . for me , there was no fussing or bending , they are the perfect size for the upper ear and the quality is very high . they look classy , and are very well made . as usual , i am very happy with amazon marketplace for their super prompt and efficient service ! 
i love these ear cuffs . i have received numerous compliments and they go with everything . i wear sterling silver balls where my ears are pierced and a cuff mid ear on each ear . 
very dainty and cute , and at such a good price . i got these for a costume i ' ll be wearing to a convention to hide the seam of little elfin ears i ' m wearing , and for that they ' ll be great . they fit nicely on the ears and are easily adjustable . i plan to wear one on a regular basis too i think ! 
they ' re beautiful , great quality and arrived quickly / as described . they ' re perfect size , not too big / bulky or too small . . i love wearing them and i recommend this seller as well as the item ! 
i was a little concerned when i bought these due to some of the negative reviews , but the cuffs are great . they ' re not fussy or difficult for me to get on - soft enough to open up a bit , but durable enough that they ' re not about to be easily bent out of shape . the edges aren ' t sharp or painful either . the bag they come in is pretty useless to me , but i didn ' t buy the earrings for the bag . overall : good cuffs for the price . 
my teens wanted a cartilage piercing and this was the compromise . it looks really expensive and is a very nice silver color . my teens love it and no one can tell it ' s not a tea piercing . very well made . 
this is a good product . a little narrow in width but still good for the price . 
i usually wear a 35x30 so i got a 36x30 and they were too small in the waist so i would recommend going bigger . and there really thick pants great for wear and tare . they just don ' t fit well in the waist . 
this pant fit just right , my size is 36 and i ordered 36 , just fit great and comfortable and well made 
these pants are really good but comparing whit the wrangler riggs the carhartt ' s are a little bit more baggy and more heavy . i think i prefer the wrangler riggs because they are just a little more comfortable but dont get me wrong these pants are really great and whit great fit too . . 
my husband only uses these for work , they are durable and can take a good beating . i dont have to mend them because they are double knee so by the time he wears thru them i just order more . 
all carhartt ' s fit differently , always have . this is a style that we know exactly what size to buy . each style fits very differently . other than that , these are the best work pants , and most durable of any other brand . we are carhartt fans . my friend ordered the wrong pair , and they were too long ( he ordered the size he would wear for normal jeans , but didn ' t know his & # 34 ; carhartt style size & # 34 ; . ) you can return them only if it ' s amazon ' s fault ( i . e . they sent the wrong size , color ) . you cannot return them if you got the size you ordered , and you can not return them . i don ' t know if that ' s an amazon thing or a carhartt thing . just make sure you are certain you know what size you want first . 
these are very sturdy work pants which would take anyone a long time to wear through . note that the waist size for these may run a couple numbers larger than what you would normally wear ( i . e . you may need to order a 32 instead of a 30 in the waist ) 
i bought these instead of arborwear ' s comparable version ( which is aerostich ' s preferred pant ) . the arborwear pair were suggested by a far more experienced rider than me . however , he ' s never tried carhartt , and i ' ve never tried arborwear , so i really can ' t compare the two . regardless , these carhartts are a pretty solid pair . they ' re of a very thick material , and they seem like they ' d handle well with sliding on asphalt & # 8211 ; in the event of a wipeout . they also allow plenty of room to move , and the gusseted crotch is great . they breathe fairly well , but could do better . i haven ' t tried any of the knee inserts , so i can ' t speak to those , but they do have that option . the biggest reason for me docking a star is due to sizing . i wish they had more / different sizes . the size down was a bit too small , and the size i ended up getting was a tad to big . all sizes were baggier than i ' d like . it ' s partially just a style thing ( because i think big baggy pants look goofy ) , but for riding purposes , it ' s also somewhat of a hazard and inconvenience . the gusseted crotch allows for all of the movement and flexibility you need for motorcycling . the baggy leg portion adds no value , and my legs were the part that actually breathed the least , so the extra size didn ' t even contribute to that . 
great carhartt quality . tough durable work pants . good selection of colors also . not sure whether i ' ll ever wear these out . 
says his pants fit fine and feel comfy . he bought the gray , brown , and black . love him in the black ! 
i also own a pair of dickies double knee , and those are the only to which i can compare : and i feel the need with reviewing these as they are much alike with a few differences - though admittedly i haven ' t washed these yet and am comparing them as they are now fresh off the truck , i can say these are a bit stiffer , they are probably made a bit better , for me , meaning they are going to last longer , probably longer than i ' ll live . my dickies are however , softer , more flexible , and more of a suede feel than these ( though admittedly , maybe after a few washes things will be different ) - one thing worth noting which i ' ll probably just learn to deal with as every piece of clothing they have their own issues , you can feel the chilly rivets through these - like , up against your skin . i do like the slightly more tapered cut of the dickies double knee i have more than these , as they ' d more likely be able to be used as a dressier pair than these carhartts . . the waist of these are a wee bit more snug in comparison . once again , perhaps many of these issues will resolve once ashed ten or twenty times , but upon first try , this is my initial impression . if things change i ' ll return and edit my opinion here in this review . hope it has been of some use to you - by all means a pair to grab , but worthy of comparing to dickies double knee first . 
these pants take the rough ranching treatment my family gives them . no mending for a very long time . wear them everyday ! 
baggier than expected , very firm and heavy canvas . ok , good for those baggy days . won ' t buy more of the same . . ok . . . 
again , for my grandson and he is so pleased he is going to order another pair as he plans on making these his daily wear . these are nicely put together and very serviceable and will wear well . we both are pleased . 
husband loves these ! he works outside . the pants are tough , don ' t tear as easy as levi ' s ( not putting levi ' s down , these are just better as work pants ! ) they also keep him somewhat dry when it is wet outside ! ! going to get some more ! ! 
my husband is a general contractor and he goes through trousers like it ' s nobody ' s business . : ( the only construction pants that even last him more than a few months are the carhartts , double front . i found them at a nice price on amazon . generally i will get them locally and cannot find his size ( 29x30 ) or a good price and have to order them in at the stores . i found them on amazon for about $ 10 less than locally . and , for some reason , i think they have even lasted longer ! i think it usually takes him a about 4 months to wear out even the double front carharrts . he ' s had these since march and they don ' t yet have holes in the knees ! ( no matter what i tell him , he won ' t use knee guards in his construction and he is constantly wearing out the knees in his construction pants - argh ! ! ! ! . ) i had been thinking to try the carhartts without the double front but i am wary because he wears out the double fronts usually pretty dang fast so i opt for the more expensive but more hardy double fronts . anyhow , when it is time to get more for him , i will be ordering from amazon again . happy with this product , as is my husband . 
i bought these to use as motorcycle pants . they are comfortable and offer some protection . i recently went on a bike trip through new mexico . the temps reached the high 90 ' s in spots and these pants were pretty warm . i also notice they are pretty heavy , but i am a big guy at 6 ' 4 & # 34 ; & 260lbs , so my nts coain a lot of material . but comfort is important on long rides and i love the way carhartt fits and they have that extra gusset of material in the crotch . 
the pants fit great . nice & comfortable plenty of room to move around with . long lasting for no matter what kind of work you do 
they are as advertised ! logger pant ! fitting is for work when bending over to pick something up theres plenty from in the crotch , a + for hours of work without showing your flower vase . 
i own 2 pair and i can move from framing to finish work and not have a problem . roomy for crawling in roofs to laying inside a cabinet . pockets are deep and roomy and can carry pens , bits , and phone . i am 6 ' 6 & # 34 ; and 200 lbs . 
you really * feel * the durability emanating from it as you wear it . i ' m a quite large guy with a little . . . plumpness . so far i ' ve done a lot of warehouse work and it has kept up with me without any worrisome feel of fraying . wonderful , i feel as i ' ve made a good investment with this pair of jeans . 
i would think that the carhartt double front logger jeans would be extremely durable , given the name brand . however much to our surprise , these jeans are constantly tearing , whether in the back pocket , front pocket , knee cap etc . the only good thing is that my husband , who is a licensed plumber , usually gets about 6 months out of each one before they start to tare . i even used those durable denim patches on them to cover up the holes and they don ' t last on this denim . overall , the price is decent . . . maybe my husband should be more careful ? ! 
wear these jeans all the time . double knee wears well , canvas quality with stands the roughest treatment . riveting withstand gates fences all you can give it . great fit , ready to wear , won ' t let me down out in the cold on the ranch . the cows think i ' m hot ! lol 
i have purchase carhartt bibs in the past . they are a good , quality product , and were what i expected . . . . right until i tried them on . i am 189 # and wear a 36 & # 34 ; waist pant which are not snug by any means . i could even get these on . i don ' t mean they were snug . they didn ' t remotely fit . i ordered a pair in 40 & # 34 ; waist thinking i would drown or at least be comfortable . they are roomier , although if i button the top side buttons i better plan on not breathing or bending over . sizing is a bit misleading ! ! 
great quality overalls . the only suggestion is to order 2 sizes larger . i had to return the first pair , as they were way too small . especially , if you want to fit a heavier shirt underneath . i got these for my husband to wear when he welds . the fabric is stiff , as most carhartt clothing is . very durable though . cant beat the price on amazon . i saw these in local stores for $ 85 and over . 
these overalls are well made and last longer because of it . my husband uses these for work ( heavy construction , welding , bridge building ) . he likes that these overalls help cushion his heavy tool belt sitting on his hips . as an added bonus , he looks pretty sexy in them . 
i ' m a big guy and i am tall and no matter how long i get my shirts i still get that damn plumber ' s butt ! ! so i decided to go with a pair of these overalls and i will say i am glad i did ! ! ! they are very comfy and look great ! ! they fit a little long in the inseam so if you wear a 32 get a 30 . i purchased a 32 and have to roll up the bottoms a litte so they won ' t drag . no more plumber ' s butt for me ! ! and they are made in the usa ! ! what more could you ask for . 
seems these bibs are cut on the snug side , at least for size large . i would suggest upsizing one size if you want assurances of functional comfort . find no other issue , bibs are the expected quality of this brand . 
fast service and with a very fair price . i bought an odd size of overalls that i cannot buy locally . i always buy carhartt work wear for the men in my house - very durable and they prefer this brand and like the way they fit . 
and he is very familiar with the brand and how it fits . . . however these bib overalls didn ' t fit as expected . they were to small and so were going to have to return them for a bigger size . we ordered a size 38 34 which is what his jeans size are , . and they fit like jeans should from hips down . . . however from hips up , not so much . . . he sys they were a little tight in the crotch area and pretty tight around the chest and stomach area . the length was right , just didn ' t measure up , on the rest . so if your a big guy that carries a little bit of a belly or plan to use them for getting on the ground or floor to work on cars and need that moving space in your pants and waste i ' d go with a size up with these . everything else was great about the overalls , the color , the stitching on the seams . . . double layered knees and the straps had a section that was stretched type material for the even bigger guys . very nice overalls they just run a little small . i ' ll come back and hope to give it 5 stars when we can get a proper sizing back . the package was done properly and they got here on time . i ' d order from this seller again . 
just what my brother was looking for . he like much , and says they are very comfortable . wears them all the time . so pleased and he is a happy camper . 
when you buy you need to remember you might be [ should be ] wearing something underneath . thus you need to buy a larger size . the folks were nice enough to allow a free return / exchange at no cost to me . so very cool of them ! ! ! yes thumbs up for carhartt . 
i ordered these one size larger than i take in levi ' s or wranglers , but they still did not fit . 
we ordered the correct waist size but ordered 1 size bigger in length because we were told by others that they run short . wrong , these were true to size so i will have to hem them . i do wish there was more adjustability on the shoulder straps . good quality product . 
i ' ve been wearing this particular model work bib for well over three years now and have been nothing short of satisfied . they are extremely durable , and even more comfortable . i would recommend these bibs to anyone who is sick and tired of having to constantly pull their pants up at work . to me , they are much more versatile than the lined versions , as i buy them a size big and add long underwear in cold weather . you really can ' t go wrong with these . 
my husband is an electrician and he likes to wear the lighter color carhartts . but these black ones are great for hiding the dirt ! i will definitely order more black . 
bought this at the request of my husband . he loves carhartt . can ' t say enough about the quality . you can ' t go wrong . just make sure you buy the right size ( lol ) . i accidently bought the wrong size but returning was a breeze ! ! i simply asked to return , printed a label , ordered the new size and woolaa ! ! easy , simple , happy , will return customer ! ! ! thanks so much for a quality product and excellent , out of this world , customer service ! 
the great looking bibs are durable for the tough jobs and have reinforced knees . i like the convenient pockets for the tools you use . 
i like and work in these almost daily they are that durable . i ' m normally rough on my clothing but these do take the abuse of farm life . the stretch of the elastic strap is an added benefit for my extra range of movement . they first came abrasive and stiff but nothing a couple of washings didn ' t take care . the extra padding in the knee is outstanding for now i don ' t hesitate to get down into the dirt . buy them again ? you bet ! i ' ll also buy some for the 6 yr old grandson , who is my main helper . 
i ordered these coveralls in black , 52x34 . when i received them , they were 52x30 . i thought i had made a mistake and had to eat the $ 17 return postage . i reordered the same item . i made sure of the size . when i checked the order it was listed as 52x30 again . i tried to cancel , but i was too late . i notified the seller with email . the seller called me back pretty quickly and told me that there was nothing they could do about it because it was amazon ' s fault for not removing the 34 inch length option . i asked him how that helps me and why would i do business with them again . he said , and i quote , " well , what am i supposed to do about it ? " . now , in order to get my refund i again have to eat $ 17 shipping . the guy that called didn ' t understand why that was a problem . never again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i purchased the bib overalls for my son and he loves them ! he could not be more pleased with the fit . 
these fit just as expected . they advised they ran a little small so we ordered the next size up and therefore they perfect , as expected . had a hard time finding this size in the store , we are very pleased . 
cant find a better price anywhere ! i have looked for these at local stores and they all cost so much more . 
i drive tractor trailer and pull a step - deck trailer for a living and the nature of my job is murder on work clothes . on a daily basis , i ' m climbing around on sharp steel and machinery that would shred lesser clothing . there ' s been several times where i have snagged my leg on a sharp steel corner hard enough to leave a nasty , deep bruise , yet the sanded duck material remained unaffected . i shutter to think about the damage i ' d have done to my leg had i only been wearing blue jeans or other light weight clothing . these things are little warm , so i only wear them in the cooler months or cooler places . the nature of my job is that this morning i might have picked up in northern nd where it is - 20 degrees , and then deliver two days later in laredo , where it might be 85 degrees , so i carry a wide selection of clothing in my truck ( all of it carhartt ) . i have one pair of lined bibs ( carhartt men ' s quilt lined sandstone bib overall ) , that when worn with thermal underwear , i have been warm and toasty working outside for several hours in windy , minus 15 degree fahrenheit weather . the non - insulated bibs , i wear when the weather is colder than 30 degrees and above zero , and then i have blue jean material carhartt bibs ( carhartt men ' s washed denim bib overall ) that i wear when the weather is above freezing . these things may seem pricey to some , but taking into account that they last virtually forever , they are a steal at this price . 
i bought these for my husband for work as he is a carpenter . he likes them and says they are great for work . they did shrink a tiny bit after the first wash . we did read the reviews prior to ordering and most said to order one size up which we did . you need to order one size up . 
these bibs tend to run one size smaller in the waist dimension , went up from 44 to 46 - 32 is still good for length on all bibs / pants i buy . i ' m 6 ' 240 lb . i really like the elastic straps super comfortable . only feature i would ask for would be pencil pocket , usually have paint marker - carpenter pencil when wearing these bibs . duck material is so durable - wear these welding - framing - truck repairs . sooo comfortable . summer time i hang them up til cooler weather . 
this is a great shirt for work . it is heavyweight and great for cold weather layering . it is great carhartt quality and can ' t be matched . 
the look of the shirt is great , the quality 5 stars too but i order a medium size and it is a bit bigger than i though . keep that in mind . maybe a small size if you are not overweight fits you better . 
overall i ' m very pleased . the color is exactly as in the picture ( midnight ) , the quality is self evident . nice and thick cloth , tightly sewn buttons , couple extra buttons , nice leathery decal on left pocket . also , the xl size i ordered ( 5 ' 10 , 210lbs ) fits me exactly like store bought xl . no complaints about any of that . i took it down one star as , the picture led me to believe the shirt had shape to it . it has none . it ' s straight up and down . i prefer shaped outer shirts but , i ' ll get used to this one . overall , i ' m very pleased . 
i was surprised to find out how well the shirts fit and how strong the material is . it is a beautiful material . the buttons and the stitching are all well made . 
this shirt is nice , but the material is heavy . so it makes for a perfect shirt at night during cooler weather . can be worn casual or dressed up . 
perfect sizing , great fit and style , very high quality material . this shirt is worth the money and i imagine i ' ll get a few years out of it . that alone makes it worth every penny . 
good solid heavy duty shirt that will stand up to whatever my hard working hubby will dish out . he likes his shirts thick , with pack able ( small tools , parts , etc ) pockets , and long tail that stays tucked into his work pants . hopefully the dark color will fade a bit in the sun on the clothesline , but the midnight was all that was available . carhartt items are always worth the price . wish it was in a western style with the snap front . 
got these today . . . extremely well made and good quality . . . . very happy with the fit and quality . . . wasn ' t sure when i ordered them . . . but am very glad i did and the price was a little high but worth the money . . 
having just gotten carhartt ' s pocket - t ' s and finding the large just right , i bit the bullet and bought the twill shirt to wear over the t ' s for early morning hikes and walks in what has been a very mild winter . pros : the material is heavy , but moves with you . in other words , it ' s not a jacket , but a heavy shirt . the twill is extremely comfortable . it is very soft , yet you can tell that it ' s " sturdy " and will wear well . the large fits over a heavy t , but fits perfectly without being tight around the middle . cons : the sleeves are about an inch short . i have worn a 16x33 in a long sleeve shirt for over 30 years . this is about a 16x31 . 5 , but if i had gotten the tall xl , the cuffs would cover my hands . ( see their sizing chart . ) this is not a box cut as the photos show . it ' s meant to be worn inside the pants . not a deal breaker , but disappointing . the label ( nylon ) stitching at the neck scrapes and chafes . it had to be carefully removed . will i buy another ? maybe , but i can ' t say for certain . if it shrinks in the wash , probably not because i don ' t want to go through the process of trying an xl . if it doesn ' t shrink and the shorter sleeves don ' t " bind " when buttoned , i probably will . stay tuned for washing results . ew 
one of my late , larger than life uncles could warm the air with a stream of salient cusses so unique that no one minded . one thing he liked was carhartt ' s quality . some things remain , and i continue to appreciate the workmanship in carhartt products . this is one generously proportioned , carefully constructed work shirt ; these guys don ' t skimp . for once , if you order an xxl , it will be really roomy . so , if you normally find xxl a little too big , the x - large may be large enough . you get every penny ' s worth from this totally practical shirt , it ' s truly durable and will last a long time while looking professional . the only caveat is be aware that this soft and comfortable high - quality shirt consists of thick heavy - duty fabric , appropriate for cool / cold weather . carhartt provides the real thing , this is not for ornamental or pretend - work wear . a borgnine thumbs - up . enjoy . 
fits good , i wanted the xxl but only one left was the xxl tall , so i went with it and even though it ' s a little big i still really like the shirt . 
looks and fits really nice . only complaint is that the length on the arms is a little to short for my liking but i can still wear it just fine . 
i liked it but just didn ' t fit like it looked in the picture . even down sized to a small which fit better from a medium but just wasn ' t at it seemed . all depends on your style . 
the moss color shows a much lighter green than the actual shirt . it is a very dark navy green . the fit is also really off . i ordered medium , which is normally perfect for me . ( although sometimes i have issues with sleeve lengths being too short . ) this is labeled medium , but definitely a large . however , i can tell that if i were to exchange it for what they label as small the sleeves would likely be a bit short . the shirt itself is very comfortable and looks durable . i ordered several other carhartt clothing and the fit is all over the place with them . everything is either larger or smaller than it should be . 
i purchased this because the shirt was made by carhartt . what can i say . . it ' s made to last forever . triple stitching , flawless . i ' m very happy with my purchase . i ' m going to buy another color just as soon as i finish this review . 
this is a great shirt from carhartt . it is warm in winter . it requires periodic ironing especially after it is washed and tumble dried . the material is soft and warm . the long sleeves cover your arms and the fabric in the main part of the shirt doesn ' t come out of your britches when you bend over . ( i bought the tall size - because i ' m tall of course ) . the buttons work well and most of the time they don ' t need to be resewn on like most of the crappy clothes imported from overseas or mexico . pocket flaps keep your junk from falling out of the pockets when you bend over to tie your work boots . the collar can be folded up to cover your neck when the cold wind of winter blows or when you come out of a scary movie at the theater and you don ' t want the monsters to grab your neck . oh my , am i projecting ? silly me . great shirt . carhartt is the best for work clothes . 
this shirt makes a comfortable light jacket . i like to wear short sleeve shirts , or just a tee shirt , but sometimes it ' s nice to have a little more protection from the wind or chill . this shirt is perfect for me . two pockets was one of my requirements . 
comfortable . roomy . well made . large pockets . here in south fl this gets used for a winter coat and the sleeves can be rolled up when it warms up . plenty of shirt tail to tuck in if it ever gets cold enough to bother here . this will last a long time . get one . 
this shirt is okay . it fits large so get one size smaller that normal . it seems to be fading fast too . for the money , it ' s not that great . a lot of people seem to highly rate this shirt , but to me it ' s nothing special . 
this is a wonderful shirt . soft yet tough canvas fabric makes it an instant favorite . i am gathering each different color together in the closet . 
very happy with the purchase . the shirts fit well and are very durable . heavy cotton construction , good for cooler climates 
this shirt , like the other ones i ' ve ordered is a large . . . . . but it fits smaller . the quality is there . . . . sizing continues to be an issue . 
when i purchased this , i was looking for something larger than my conventional insulated lunch box . this pack easily lives up to that requirement , and more . there is plenty of storage in the main insulated area , enough space for lunch for several people . beyond that there is a handy place to drop your water bottle in . there are several other outside pockets for all kinds of purposes . i normally pack my lunch , a twenty six ounce insulated thermos bottle , a kindle , and various and sundry other pieces of equipment . it is not perfect , i would like a little more space on some mornings , but for most of time it is a great solution . i would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for something slightly more commodious than their current lunch box . 
one week in , this backpack cooler has been great . it ' s very well made and intelligently designed , with plenty of storage for all my lunch items and various doodads . the front pocket is just the right size for my 7 & # 34 ; kindle fire and a couple of other items . the insulation seems to be of adequate thickness , and it has thus far kept my stuff cold when necessary , and it has not leaked water from the condensation of ice packs . the mocha color is great , and this is an attractive backpack that i have no qualms about hauling around - plus , the size is perfect . it ' s plenty big enough for what it needs to be , but not so large that you would hesitate to bring it on a day trip or wherever else you might need to go . i ' ve found myself throwing it in my car when i take off somewhere . . . it ' s super handy ! there a lot of thoughtful touches , such as a sturdy carabiner , and lots of pockets and pouches . i purchased this backpack for $ 40 with free shipping from amazon . at that price , it ' s a steal . i could have purchased something vastly inferior at one of the nearby big box stores ( i looked there first ) . . . but why ? i would much rather spend the extra ten dollars and get a backpack that actually looks good and is built to superior standards for longevity . i ' m going to use this for my lunch ( and other things ) every single day , so it only makes sense to invest in something worthwhile . i bring a lot of food and water on the job with me , and this is way , way better than trying to jam it all into my old cooler ( and it ' s much easier to carry , too ) . on that subject , i was very pleased to see that the manufacturer guarantees this product for life . the only thing that i didn ' t like was that it claimed damage due to & # 34 ; ordinary wear and tear & # 34 ; is not covered ( i don ' t expect them to cover damage due to abuse , etc . ) . . . . i ' m not exactly sure what that means . if one of the major zippers breaks after being used over the course of a couple of years , the backpack will become useless . will the manufacturer do the right thing , and honor their word ? or will they shrug their shoulders and say it ' s a result of wear and tear ? the backpack is very well made , don ' t get me wrong . but if i should have an issue and the manufacturer attempts to squirm out of their responsibility , my rating will promptly descend from five stars to one . here ' s hoping that picnic time ' s ethics are as good as this backpack ! if you need a suitable backpack for bringing your lunch to work , or are looking for something for the beach and / or day trips . . . look no further ! this is the one . 
i needed an insulated lunch carrier for work . . . i didn ' t want the typical square box . this is very well insulated . . . has a lot of nice compartments . it really holds the cold in all day . the bottle carrier is nice for things other than bottles too ! it does not come with a water bottle . . . so i am confused why there are any complaints on that topic . plus , i use if for my own bottles . . . i don ' t fill my own bottles with any drinks or water . the back pack part actually works and is comfortable . it is basically the perfect size backpack that is also insulated . not as big as a regular back pack which really makes it perfect for your lunch and / or a couple days of clothes . the perfect bug out bag too . oh , and the water bottle holder comes off if you want it to . 
my wife picked this up for me as a daily lunch carrier since i tend to carry books and other items besides my lunch . it was a bit larger then expected but since i work in an art field no one seemed to make fun of it since some of them carry truly strange things . although it ' s larger then i ' d like it is good for what it is and therefore i recommend it . pros : rugged , thick canvas . strong zippers , though plastic . thick insulation . plenty of zippered pockets . large capacity . good for a day trip on the trail . external bottle carrier . cons : cheapest water bottle ever made . leaks . ( you ' ll be replacing it . ) velcro on small side pockets is worthless . should be magnetic snaps . pocket inside main compartments lid is very awkward to use . main flap has small velcro strip . not a secure fastener . 
it ' s a nice size bag , for going out for a picnic . and it ' s useable for going on vacation , in aairline trip . 
fits well , looks like pictured . hasn ' t tarnished or changed color and ive had it for a few years now . pretty decent quality for the price . 
bought this as a birthday present for my girlfriend and she adored it . i have absolutely no complaints about it . 
i feel in love with this ring when i saw it . when it arrived in the mail , i put it on and havent taken it off . and that was while ago . 
i love this ring ! it is so beautiful ; the design is gorgeous and it is great quality . i got it for my sister , but i am very tempted to buy one for myself ! 
i bought thhis ring for my daughter , and i liked it so much that i purchased another one for myself ! it is lovely ! 
i got this ring as an anniversary present . i asked for a pretty , inexpensive ring that i could wear while tdy and deployed because i didn ' t want to lose my wedding set in a foreign country . i love celtic designs , and the sizes are pretty much spot on ( at least for me ) . 
i bought this ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend , and she really liked it . the product was very well made , and arrived promptly . a + + 
very shiny unlike other sterling silver i own . if the other reviews weren ' t so good i would worry that it isn ' t sterling . love the ring hate the shipping but i needed a size 3 and couldn ' t find one anywhere else . if the ring holds up i will order another style of size 3 from the seller . the ring is big enough for any finger in my opinion and larger than i would normally wear on my pinkie but i already got over that ! - - lots of compliments on the ring . i do love it but on my pinkie that is where the eye goes and the ring outshines anything else on that hand . the ring is holding up very well . 
i love the look of celtic jewelry so when i saw this , i love it ! it arrived on time and it looks cute ! the only thing that ' s a little different from the picture , it that the picture makes the ring look a little thicker than it really is . but it ' s still a good quality ring , i wear mine everyday and have no problems . i would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but cute ring 
ring was bought for grandchild ' s birthday . nice quality and weight ; good design touches . . . and she ishappy . best deal yet ! 
bought for pinkie finger ; sizing fits perfect and comfortably ; very happy with ring ; like the way it looks and fits on pinkie finger ; ordered size 4 . 
i bought this in a size 7 and it fits perfectly for me . i wear this ring almost every day and it still shows no sign or wear and tear or tarnishing . excellent detailing , true to size , and durable ! 
i love rings ! ! actually , i have a ring on all my fingers , really , except my thumb which i might do next lolanyways , this one pinky ring i had on my pinky , was getting old , so i decided to replace pinky ring for my little finger which was size 3 . its beauitifull ! i now have 5 heart rings . . . i never never take my rings off . . . i keep them on till they get old lolsometimes i tap tap to music of the beats with my rings haaayes it kinda wears them down loli try not to tho . anyways , this ring has a great meaning to me & it shines really nice , it also would be great for a childs ring , the design is stunning ! ! ! id recommend this ring for anyone who loves tiny rings for there little finger or as a gift , or for a child , i believe theres more good reviews than bad , 
true to size . well made and pretty . looks like it will hold up well . exactly as pictured , that ' s a plus to me . 
absolutely wonderful - - bought it as a pinkie ring , and it fits perfectly . the design is raised enough to be eye - catching , but not so high that it catches on things when you are working around the home or yard . just love this ring ! 
this is an eye catcher ! i have gotten many compliments on this little ring which costs very little . it has a very nice shine and design and really is a great bargain ! 
i bought this as a pre - valentine ' s day present for myself and am glad i did . i have long and slender fingers but although the ring is small it filled the front of my finger very nicely - - because my fingers are long some delicate rings just seem to get " lost " and don ' t look like much no matter how nice they are , but this one is very much " there " in an understated way . the ring is flat and smooth and does not catch on to clothing , hose , etc . , as a similarly designed ring might . i would love a ring like this in gold but in the meantime this is a nice and girly fun thing to wear from time to time and a new addition to my silver collection that i am quite fond of . i think this would be a special yet inexpensive gift for a girlfriend , sister , daughter , etc . which is almost guaranteed to bring a smile to the receiver . 
have bought this ring twice , the first time it was too small . it is very pretty . the heart and knots are not chunky looking , but instead are very feminine . i use it as a toe ring . it has bent out of the round , but this was a plus for me because now the decoration stays on the top of my toe instead of sliding to the underside . i never take it off . 
like silver love hearts already have on but it was to big so i ordered another one , fits nice , looks good on , never take it off 
i bought 4 of this ring , one for each of my three sisters and one for myself . i like the delicate , filigree celtic knot heart design . we all have small hands and fingers . this ring design doesn ' t overwhelm our hands . 
very cute and very sturdy . i ' m very rough with this ring and it has never faded in color or bent in shape . it doesn ' t exactly look expensive , but it works as an everyday ring . 
this ring is so detailed and beautiful ! i wear it as a pinky ring and with other rings - it looks great . 
we both love it and constantly wear it ! it arrived quickly and as described , very good quality ( does not leave green ring on your finger ! ) . i recommend it . 
i absolutely love this ring ! this ring fits perfectly and is simply gorgeous . everybody complemented the ring and asked me where i got it . i would definitely buy it again for a present . 
my daughter was impressed with this ring . it is danty and looks good on her finger . i forget what we paid for it , but her reaction was priceless . 
very nice looking ring , also seems well made . bought it for my daughter and her friend . they both love it . 
i needed this shirt for work on a fine dining dinner boat . it was exactly what i needed , and has served me well for almost a year now . i find the material to be of good quality , but almost 1 / 2 the price of men ' s warehouse . 
although the shirt is a poly cotton blend , it does not look like a cheap shirt and looks really great . 
the quality of the shirt is rather good but the sizing is way off . i read this comment from other reviews but decided to take a chance as there were sufficient positive reviews to substantiate making the purchase . this is something which i believe the seller can easily correct . it was a bit frustrating to have to go through the process of doing the return and having to go out and look for another shirt at the mall . 
shirt fits well and i ' ll probably buy at least one more . it ' s also has very comfortable collar compared to my previous tux dress shirt of the same size . 
i needed a formal shirt with a down turned pointed collar . found this one on amazon and ordered it . it arrived promptly and fits just right . material is good quality and just what i wanted . 
i ordered by neck size , what was sent was x size and they do not come close to being the same . the shirt was of good quality , but the size was wrong . 
i wear this shirt on formal nights on a cruise ship . the pleated front is classy . the price was good and the fit was just fine . i don ' t need to iron it , if i get it out of the washer quickly and dry it on the permanent press cycle it looks good enough thanks to the poly / cotton blend material . 
this is my third pair of keen sandals . very comfortable with excellent support . the sandals are sturdy and wears well . i wasn ' t quite ready to get another pair but they were on sale and what woman cant use another pair of shoes in a different color 
love these sandals . i did order 1 / 2 size up , and they fit great . they are very comfortable , and have good support , and are great for hiking . love the leather , and the color . 
i really like keens for the summer . they ' re so much more supportive than crocs or flip flops , yet they ' re not as hot and sweaty as gym shoes . i love that you can still do many outdoor activities in these shoes . there is a lot of foot support . 
made me look like a mountain goat . front too high and uncomfortable and hard to get foot inside . . . a dumb design . . . . surprised people didn ' t say this in reviews before - must have numb feet and don ' t know what is a comfortable shoe . . . keen - you should be ashamed . 
i normally take a size 9 in keen shoes , and this size always gives me a bit of room allowing for different keen styles . i would say though that these sandals feel alot smaller , not sure if its the style / cut of the sandal . they are comfortable , yes a bit bulky but my foot is secure and does not slip around when walking . i would suggest to anyone buying these that if you take a size 9 normally and its usually a proper fit with not much extra room to order at least 1 / 2 a size up . i like the colour of these sandals and the fact that the straps are leather , they will be perfect for walking the dog in the summer . they provide good arch support 
these are my go - to shoes for hiking or walking long distances . i ' ve purchased 3 pairs so far & they ' ve worked out really well for me . the toe box is roomy , they ' re fairly supportive , well - made and rugged . i ' ve been very thankful for the toe protection and have alot of miles on these . they ' re worn for walking , on moderate hikes of 10 - 14 miles , and on rafting trips . other than being slightly faded they look as they did when purchased . as far as cons go - they ' re a little heavy for sandals , and if worn in sandy environments the sand gets caught in the toe area & you ' ll have to take them off to dump it out . i got my regular shoe size & the fit was perfect . the toe box is roomy , which i like since i have somewhat wide feet . those these have served me very well , i ' m on the hunt for a sandals with all the good qualities of this pair along with less weight . on my last trip we ( and our luggage ) had to get weighed in for the tiny plane we were on , and i realized it would be great to have all these pluses along with something that weighs a bit less - both for the weight of my luggage and the comfort of my feet ! oh - i should mention that my 3rd pair is definitely smaller than the 1st two . they must have changed their sizing , and now 1 / 2 size up might be a good idea . 
i thought my feet were on the wide range of normal . these shoes shouldactually be sold for people with who are specially wide . doesn ' t fit at alllike arroyo . arroyo ' s are longer and more slender . overall quality is stillgood . just doesn ' t fit me correctly . 
owning 2 other pair of keene newports , i was pretty sure of my choice ! ordered a half size up on advice of online raters as they are water shoes and i do wear my thorlos in them a great deal of the time . the only difference in feel from my newport h2s is that the leather grabs the socks a bit on foot entry as opposed to the nylon straps . i expect the leather will smooth and leaving the laces in loosened position helps too . support and looks are great as well . my 3 season ( and work ) shoes are great ! 
i was thrilled to find my perfect size , 10 . 5 ! however , even though my feet are very slender , there sandals were very tight and extremely hard to pull on over the heel . the entire shoe including the toe bed is very tight ! so disappointed . . . i love keen , but these are a very poor fit . 
i bought these shoes to replace my worn out work shoes . i own a bakery and am on my feet 12 hours a day . these shoes were put to the test the other night when i started work at 2 : 30 a . m . decorating cakes , then worked a farmer ' s market until 1 : 00 p . m . standing on concrete . before wrapping up the day , l went shopping for supplies in one of the big box stores - again on concrete . finally got to bed at 10 : 00 p . m . of course i was tired , but my feet didn ' t hurt , my legs felt great and no hip or back pain . i love these shoes . my advice ? go for it you weekend hikers ! 
these provide strength and protection , more so than the venice which are more open . true to keen sizing with a generous toe box . they are a bit tight at the moment ( instep ) and it might take a while but i think they will loosen up with wear . heavy duty sole is supportive and looks ready for anything . nice tough looking leather and this colour is actually nice - not too dark , not to light - with the synthetic trim bits at back of ankle and instep the only bit to show a stripe of " baroque rose " . 
i found this to be the case for both the newport & # 8217 ; s and the newport h2 & # 8217 ; s . color as shown . love the arch support and the toe guard . this is a moderately substantial feeling shoe . well constructed shoe that will protect your feet . i can wear these all day and not wake up the next morning without foot pain . great shoe . 
first my normal shoe size is women ' s us 8 . 5 , i needed a 9 in these to have a little extra room / comfort for the toes . this style of keens is all i ' ve worn for years . if gets cold i add socks . i walked around rome , florence and paris for a month . took my keens and a super expensive pair of finn comfort shoes . i worn the keens the whole time . they take a good while to wear out . this is my 3rd pair and is a good price for them . i don ' t know what i will do if they stop making them . 
way too small and just not quite wide enough . the last pair of newport sandals i tried on in an 8 fit really nicely . i have wider feet and a lower arch so i can ' t always find shoes that fit well . these , however , were lacking a little in width and my toes hit the end . disappointing as otherwise they would have fit nicely . returned them and was about to order an 8 . 5 because i think those would have fit perfectly but the prices have become way more expensive for every pair of newports i look at . oh well , guess i will save my money this way ! 
excellent , classic sandal from keen . i have very flat feet and can feel the arch support . more of a closed sandal so foot feels very secure , can understand why newports are great for long walk / hike . as usual , and this issue is always important when i review keen reviews by others , go 1 / 2 size up from usual size shoe . great buy from amazon . 
i love the look and the color of the shoes but i could not wear them as they were too small and too tight . i was about to send them back when my daughter came in . she asked if she could try them on . she wears a size 8m and these fit her . so , i ' m out a pair of keens . i really like keens and have 3 pairs , but a different style , but have found them to run small which is why i ordered 8 . 5m to start with . i ' ve come to the conclusion i need to try on the shoes in person before buying . 
i love keen , i own 6 pairs of keens in different styles . this seasons keens are tight on the toes . i am trying a larger size but i am worried they will not fit either . there is a new toe bar that is entirely too far forward . if i try to put my foot far enough forward to be in the correct place for the toe bar , my toes are curled into a cramped position and the arch support is in the wrong place . i love the old fit , wide tall toe box and high correctly placed arch , no toe bar , no pinching . i just hope the 11 fits better than the 10 . 5 . 
beyond a doubt this is one of my all time favorite shoes . i must admit to having four pair of them . they are comfortable in the extreme and almost impossible to kill . i am extremely hard on shoes and spend most of my time off the beaten path ( literally ) . i have had no problem with these shoe / sandals what - so - ever . as bad as i have beaten the main pair i wear , the still took good when i hit civilization . the sandal has several features i love and the toe caps are at the top of this list . i tend to run into things and with regular sandals i am constantly stubbing a toe , or indeed , cutting one ! no problem with these shoes . they give the ends of the toe plenty of protection . as with another reviewer here , i had no problem with sizing and ordered my regular shoe size ( of which i am not about to tell you what it is here ) , but trust me , they fit . i walk over some pretty rough and varied terrain and am completely satisfied with the tractions these shoes give . even over loose shale and rather slick creek bottoms , they hold me up well . i love the no tie stretchy lace on these . they are fast and efficient . they clean up well . most importantly though , these shoes are simply comfortable and extremely functional . also , you cannot beat the price they are asking here . i paid a heck of a lot more for my first two pair . it must be noted that these do pick - up sand and dirt but to be honest , i have never owned a pair of like shoes that did not . . . it is in their nature to do so . 
i purchased these after researching closed toe hiking sandals for one that would provide the strong arch support that i need ( for pronation issues with one foot . ) although i loved the look and design of the shoe , it simply did not have much arch support . so i returned the shoe and , instead , ordered a pair of open - toed orthaheel hiking sandals - which did provide the excellent arch support that orthaheel does so well . 
the waistline ( size 14 ) berely fits - it ' s too tight and very uncomfortable . don ' t know what kind of elastic they used but it is not stretchy at all . but below the waist because of the pleats those pants really balloon out so the front looks rather ugly . it is a total enigma why they called them relaxed fit - if i buy size 16 to feel comfortable at waistline - below the waist i ' ll look like a circus clown . and i haven ' t even washed them yet . possible to wear with smth long over them to cover the ugly puffed front , but otherwise not . so no , definitely not buying this model again . 
most of the pants i get on - line are a little small so i went ahead and ordered a larger size . well , in this case they run as sized which all - in - all is a good thing . they are well made and have a great feel . 
these slacks have what used to be the normal waist for a lady . . . they actually fit the true waist , not the low cut that is very unflattering unless you top out at 100 lbs . feel comfortable . . . exactly as described . thanks lee jeans . 
i love these pants , they ' re quite comfortable and feel durable through the several wearings / washings i ' ve subjected them to . my only two complaints are : - - the waist is very small . my waist is much smaller than everything below . the pants fit great around the hips / buttocks / thighs but the waist is tight . if it weren ' t for the small elastic panels in the band , i probably wouldn ' t be able to wear them . that being said , the pants do tend to relax after a few minutes of wear and i can tolerate the discomfort . ( i just wouldn ' t wear them to anything like thanksgiving dinner ! ) - - the legs are short . i have average length legs and find pants either break across the top of my foot with a little bit below the top of my shoe or they ' re really long and i step on them . not these pants . they come just to the top of my foot - in other words , wear nice socks or whatever because as you walk , they will be seen . if i had tried these on in a store , i wouldn ' t have purchased them . they fit enough that i didn ' t want to hassle with returning them ( though amazon was great about the other brand of pants i returned ) . i ' m not sure buying a size larger would help because , as i said , they fit everywhere else . 
i loved them the moment i put them on . material is soft and well made . i love the color . i had to buy another pair . they are just what i wanted . 
i ' m short ( 5 ' 41 / 2 ) and when i usualy get the ' short ' sizes i end up with the legs too short . . . not the case here . it ' s a perfect fit and they have a real zipper and are made of a nice quality material too . 
i am keeping these reluctantly as the legs and thighs fit ok but won ' t buy any plus size pants online again given this new " make these ladies have an hour glass figure with a thick tight elastic waist " trend . the pants hurt around the waist if i button them up also given i have gi issues like surgical adhesions pressing on my organs . i don ' t need a girdle tight elastic waist pressing on them as well . i have another pair of lees relaxed fit jeans from a year ago i will wear when i need to button up my pants in company . these are just for shopping with a coat over them or the like . but then i got creative and made two slight nicks in the waist band where the elastic is and removed part of it . ah no pain , i ' ve more to do all without ruining the waistband - - just a little nick that will help me cut and remove the elastic is what i needed to do . but never again will i buy plus size pants online again - - i found the same girdle pain waistband on a pair of capris . 
pantalones comods , de buen corte e inmenjorable calidad , puedo decir que la relacion preci / calidad es inigualable , para mi una excelente compra 
i checked size 18 , which was the only size left , and got a 24 . i cannot wear these but the hassle of returning them isn ' t worth it . please correct the sizing info on this item . 
for me , these are comfy , but the waist is just a little too small and the pleats are just a little puffy , but they are great pants for work and hopefully with the good spring weather here , i ' ll lose a little around my waist and they ' ll fit perfectly . 
love them , fits as expected , like the fabric , , they dont shrink , feel soft and make you look dressy the elastic in the waist make fit better 
nothing , and i mean nothing shows through this bra . it ' s the perfect t - shirt bra . padding is very thin but stiff and hides better than the softer contour cups for me . takes a bit of breaking in but so worth it ! once it ' s on , you need never worry about showing more than you ' d like , you ' ve got perfect round curves all day . i did find the band a bit tight at first but it loosened up within a week of wearing and is now comfortable . i didn ' t get the torpedo effect at all . for me , one size smaller in the cup fit best . 
i can ' t stress enough the importance of being fitted properly in a store like nordstrom , bloomingdales , or bravissimo . if you are being fitted at victoria ' s secret , you are most likely wearing the wrong size and if you use your vs size to order this bra , you won ' t be satisfied . that being said , this bra will probably work best for people with larger breasts ( d and above - i wear a 32h ) . if you have little boobs , by all means , don ' t spend this much on a bra and definitely wear something more comfortable ! ! ! this bra is worth its weight in gold , though for people like me who want the firmest support possible and are willing to sacrifice a little bit of comfort for it . this bra really gives a great natural lift that other bras can ' t even come close to . yes , it is a bit stiff , especially at first , but it looks wonderful under clothes and , with the little bows , it is as cute as it can get for such a functional bra . for women with a small back size and large cup size , it doesn ' t get better than this . 
they didn ' t turn me off , either , and i was kind of wrong . don ' t misunderstand : this bra is great . it ' s an awesome t - shirt bra , it ' s comfortable , it ' s well made , and if you don ' t mind the coning , definitely go for it . however , if you ' re thinking it ' ll give you the same kind of coning retro lingerie will give you , you ' ll be disappointed . the retro coning has an almost pyramid shape to it ; your breasts come to a point . a dull one , sure , but there ' s an implied sharpness underneath it . this coning is somewhere * between * that coning and no coning at all . too pointed to be modern , too dull to be vintage . if you ' re over a d cup ( as i am ) , it ' s just gonna look a little weird in a t - shirt . but if you ' ve got anything up to and including a d cup , you probably wouldn ' t notice it . 
based on how this bra looks in the picture , i thought it would be great for shallow breasts . it ' s not at all . the cups were really really deep , and just huge in general . 
i wear a 34 dd , and have been on the lookout for a supportive bra . pros : does not itch ( my skin is sensitive to lace and other such materails ) very good support ( my friends even noticed and commented on it ) comfy enough to wear for the whole dayno show through when worn with t - shirtsstraps does not hurt or leave lines on shoulderswith the extra support , i ' ve had no backpains due to the weight of the boobies . cons : a tad bit pricey . however , it is worth the cost . i even bought two more on sale . i have and would continue recommending to my friends . 
padding is a bit heavier than my other fantasie bras , but that is expected as it ' s a smoothing bra . i like the way it looks under my fitted shirts . another great bra from fantasie . 
i love this style of bra and currently own several of them in various sizes ( weight fluctuations ) . anyway , it is always strong and supportive . i have a narrow frame and full bust ( 32gg at the moment ) , and this bra is perfect for me for several reasons . i love the look this gives under shirts : smooth , rounded , with a little hint of cleavage . this is a balcony , not a demi so the cleavage is subtle but nice . this bra is molded and to me , that is one of the best aspects of this bra : it ' s like your breasts are air cushioned throughout the day and i find it helps them feel less heavy to me as i am carrying them . think about it like shocks on a car . i notice in unlined bras , i don ' t get that air cushioned feeling that i get from this bra . i never have issues with ridges in my shoulders as the band is very supportive . additionally . the straps are leotard in the back so they give a good lift and do not slip off or cause chaffing in the underarm area . i typically will have two in black and two in nude and they last a really long time if you rotate your bras and wash them with lingerie wash . though they are pricey , these are on the cheaper end of high quality bras and they last and no what they are supposed to . highly recommend though be sure that you get the proper size , that will help with them lasting longer and giving the right support - - i went to the local nordstrom ' s and got fitted , then i buy them there or on amazon as needed . excellent product . 
band was great at 36 & # 34 ; , i measure 34 , but a 34 is too tight for me . i have been buying an e cup and 38 inch band . however i went to these online bra fitting calculators and they inidicated i should try a 36 band and a bigger cup , . . . . well i guess i went too big . so thinking about reordering just a smaller cup size . i am 5 & # 34 ; 6 ' and 150lb . 
i bought my first of this bra in a specialty store to get the correct fit . the price is better here . i wear a 32f dense heavy breasts and this bra holds the girls up well . it ' s also comfortable . makes my clothes look much neater . victoria secret is for the young , small breasted , or artificial breasts . believe me i tried to make them work for me . forget it and invest in a good bra like fantasie ! 
the bra itself is a lovely material , appears well made , etc . however , once it ' s on , it ' s stiff and uncomfortable and creates an awkward pointy profile typically seen in the 60 ' s . i returned it and got a swift refund . 
i love this bra . i ' ve bought like four of them so far . i ' m a size 30g and have a hard time finding my size unless i go to nordstrom , but i ' m not always ready and willing to spend upward of $ 100 for a bra , so this is a nice alternative for the price . it gives decent support and padding provides good coverage , and my former one that i just got rid of lasted a couple years and i even put it in washer . 
it is a weird fitting bra . i am 50 years old and have always worn a d cup since i was 15 years old . . and these cups are a tad big . . . and pointy . . . very pointy . . push the point and they collapse in . i have many & # 34 ; shelf & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; balcony & # 34 ; bras . . none fit like this . i waited 10 days for this bra from the day i ordered it , and it was supposed to be prime ? awaiting the paperwork to return this . 
i absolutely love this bra . there is zero show through , and it fits seamlessly . wear the nude color under your tightest white top and you still won ' t see the bra or what ' s beneath it . it ' s padded for support , not for size ( at least on the larger cup sizes ) . support is unparalleled , and it ' s very comfortable . it ' s by far the best bra i own . the best part is that it comes in a wide variety of cup sizes , many of which you ( unfortunately ) won ' t find through victoria ' s secret or other common retailers . very highly reccomended ! 
this is nice fabric and i ' ll probably try again in a smaller size but it was the first fantasie i tried . i thought it would fit like chantelle . i pretty sure i ' ll need a smaller cup than i need for panache or freya , and a smaller band than chantelle . 
i just double checked the style number now to make sure i had the right bra because i can ' t believe all of the positive reviews . i am a 34ddd in nearly every size but apparently i am not in this one . i had muffin tops where my boobs were overflowing the cups and the straps were thin and very elasticy . i can ' t imagine feeling support even if i bought a cup size up . if felt like most victoria secret bra ' s for me where i have to re - adjust the straps three times a day because the metal thing keeps sliding down . i am glad it is doing it ' s job for so many other women out there but sadly it did not work for me . 
was small around my neck - i ' m not a big fellow - i have other shirts which are the same size & they fit perfectly - this one was a mess - neck was too small & heaven help you if you over stretch the neck button cause it won ' t pull back the way it ' s supposed to - gave it away in one of those cloths donation bins . . . 
good shirt , perfect size , just as the picture shows . the material is a little thin , but very pleasent in summer . 
very nice shirt at a good price ! it fits well . i like that the cuffs can either be used with cuff links or with the included buttons . 
got this for a wedding to replace an old tuxedo shirt . i had read other reviews and i thought based on them that this would be a nice permanent replacement for my tuxedo shirt . well , unfortunately , the old adage is true here - you get what you pay for . this review is based on the fit . i ' m 6 ' 1 & # 34 ; , 190 lbs , athletic buildpros : - its a formal shirt - its a nice white , not off - white - it comes with free , horrible plastic black buttons ( worthless , but unexpected ) cons : - horrid fit - very loose in the body and the arms were a bit wanky - stray string hanging on a few buttonsunfortunately , fit is everything for me when it comes to fashion . this shirt did not fit me well but i imagine it may work out better for someone who has a beer belly and some fat arms . 
need a tuxedo shirt for formal dinners . it came with black scuds for the shirt beside the buttons , which is a plus . i was good that it had the shorter length , because i am wider but not taller . 
a little big for my fifteen month old twins , but still wearable . better too big than too small ! overall , crocs are the best toddler shoes i ' ve found for my three year old . durable , flexible , easily washable , comfortable , breathable , can be worn with or without socks and at this age they look cute with everything . oh , and cheap enough i don ' t mind buying a new pair every year . 
i bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . the sizing is odd so i had to return them 
kids love crocs , what more is there to say ? they come in a ton of colors , are washable and lightweight , great for hot weather , and hold up well . my daughter somehow fit into the same size for two years . no scratches , stains , holes , tears . i know that the footbed supposedly molds to your foot . for this reason , i didnt think my younger daughter should wear these as hand - me - downs , but honestly , i dont see or feel it in the shoe at all . so whether you buy into that part of the crocs design , that ' s up to you . but for us , two kids are getting use out of an inexpensive shoe that basically looks new . can ' t beat that . 
great crocs , as always . i love how durable they are . my son wears them all year , outdoors in summer and as slippers in winter . the yellow is very bright , but looks awesome . my son wears size 9 shoes but does well with the 10 / 11 crocs . 
these are great little shoes , but they run big ! my 22 month old wears a size 4 and these were huge on her ; instead of sending them back though we are just going to hold onto them for when her feet grow a bit . that being said , after we got these i went onto zappos and got the infant size 2 - 3 and they fit perfect . she loves her crocs and it is really all she will wear . 
my 2 year old daughter hates wearing shoes , so my pediatrician recommended trying these . i got the hot pink ones ( fuchsia ) , and they are much cuter than i thought they would be . they are super easy to get on my child ' s feet ( which is a huge plus when you have to chase your toddler down and wrestle them on ) . judging by the fact that they remained on my kid ' s feet ( without tears ! ) , i ' m going to say they are very comfortable . i appreciate that after a day of playing in the dirt , i can just toss the shoes in the bathtub with my kid and rinse the dirt right off both of them . i imagine these would make great water shoes too , for days at the beach or splash park . i definitely recommend these shoes for active and / or picky footed toddlers . 
my son loves his crocs . i just hate when he loses track of them because it is an ordeal to find them when we are trying to leave the house . he goes everywhere with them . they are breathable , durable , easy to clean and come in every color he would want . only drawback . . . jibbitz . they are tough to remove from an old pair and hard to ' snap ' in a new pair . but them that is because they can ' t shake loose or fall out easily . 
my kids love crocs . they are comfortable , can take the beating of being worn all summer by a toddler , and they get bonus points for being able to get wet ( but be aware that does make them slippery on the inside ) . 
crocs shoes are my kids favorite shoes . he is 1 . 5 years old and he loves them that he wants to wear them even when he needs dress shoes . they are easy to put on and off . they clean very easily . they look better after 3 months of wear and tear than regular shoes . as his foot grows he can still wear them rather than having to purchase another pair . they don ' t make his feet stinky compared to some other sandal / clog that i previously purchased . 
love ' em ! fun to take off the ol ' keens and get these puppies on my feet after a long , serious day . i can ' t wait to try the camo - version . you just can ' t go wrong with a pair of these crocs to help support your tired feet when kinking around the garage or your den . enjoy ! 
i received a pair made in mexico . one shoe had weird shape ( pinky toe area was wider than the sole ) . it looked like my kid can slide her foot from side to side and can easily trip over . returned and ordered another pair ( red ) . this pair was made in china and looks fine . 
light weight and totally easy to clean , our toddler loves them ! they come in so many different colors now ! great product ! 
these have been a staple in my house since my son could walk . . makes it so easy to get out the door . . just slip them on and go . . perfect for year round wear accept for in snow obviously . lol . but they come in so many colors , fit wide feet and fat feet and are affordable . 
my two year old loves these . she is in a size 6 and i ordered her the 6 - 7 ' s and they are perfect . she can also wear them with socks . considering she hates closed toe shoes , these ones passed the test ! 
i bougfht these for my granddaughter because i bought her pink glitter flats that her parents didn ' t exactly appreciate . how was i supposed to know that glitter comes off - everywhere - all the time - even when you think it ' s done shedding ? anyway , the flats were pink , and these were pink , and they were just like mommy ' s , so i got her these and some jibbitz and made a promise that i wouldn ' t buy her glitter anything anymore . everyone is happy now . 
comfortable as every pair of crocs i ' ve wore . a classic and user friendly pair of clogs , even in hot weather . 
yep , they are crocsi i have twin boys . the green and blue were both the cheapest amazon had , so i told them they could choose blue or green . one got blue and one got green , and today they decided to each wear one of each color . super cute ! they do run a bit big , but i discovered that with our size 4 - 5 . my guys can still wear their 8 / 9 although their shoe size is really 10 now . these tend to fall off , but they can wear them somewhat . you have to expect that sort of issue when a single shoe is covering 2 sizes . i mean usually they have half sizes , these cover 2 sizes . if you buy a 10 / 11 for a boy with a size 10 foot it isn ' t going to be a bit too big . their others are getting a little too small , but as a stride rite size 10 the 8 / 9 croc fits better than the 10 / 11 . 
pros : 1 . easy to wash2 . stays on my boy ' s feet despite him doing whatever crazy things boys do . 3 . protects toes / feet on the playground4 . doesn ' t smell after a whole summer of wearing5 . very durablecons : 1 . it ' s all my boy ever wants to wear2 . it fits a little larger than other shoessummary : this is the perfect summer footwear for little kids , especially if your 5 year old boy is anything like mine . these little crocs are tough and durable , and all it take for me to clean them is to hose it off ( sometimes with my kid still wearing them ) . mud , sand , dirt , various pieces of plants and shrubs , whatever . . . it all gets washed off within a few seconds of getting the hose . last year ' s pair was worn almost daily from april to october and they ' re in good enough shape to give to his younger sister when her foot gets big enough . the only drawback is that he loves them so much trying to get him to wear anything else is like pulling teeth . these crocs are just a bit larger in size than standard shoes of the same size , but i think they ' re designed that way . although they ' re roomy , the back strap does a great job keeping it stuck to my kid as he runs down the street , hill , beach , through the stream , down the path , into the mudpile , etc etc . 
i strongly believe every child should have a pair of these . i buy them as gifts for everyone i know . and they last forever so what can be better . crocs are suoer durable and clean . i use a mr clean white pad and wipe them clean . then its like new all over again ! 
my daughter loves these . they are so easy to put on and convenient . and , her fav color is purple so that is a plus too ! 
nothing like being able to slip on a shoe when the kids want to run outside for a bit or you need to run to the store . we ered on the big size so my 3 year old could grow into it . i love these shoes ! 
my son who is 4 is very picky about shoes . the way they feel or flop on his feet . he will not wear flip flops or the velcro type of sandals and he loves these ! now we don ' t have to wear socks and shoes all of the time ! i find they fit him true to his usual shoe size . fun colors to choose from too . mine wanted them brown like the dirt . go figure : ) 
comfy , easy to wear , easy to clean , easy for a little one to get on and off by themselves . crocs make great shoes for indoor or outdoor wear . we will continue buying these as their feet grow : ) 
these crocs are made of a really soft plastic that provides excellent comfort and air flow . i will say that they are cheaply made but hear that the quality has gone down since they are made in mexico ( ours ) and not china anymore . 
the crocs shoes are for comfort at any age , very light and durable , i recommned for kids and adults . 
crocs are really a classic shoe . we bought this pair for our daughter , as she has outgrown her last few pair . we wear them to the pool , when we just need to run outside for a minute , when we take our dog outside . . . and i don ' t know if this is recommended or not , but frozen crocs feel wonderful on sore feet ! 
my daughter wears a size 6 on stride rite shoes and the size 4 / 5 toddler fits well right now . not a lot of room to grow but i think the next size would be too big . 
they do run large so prepare for a little bit of tripping while the child adjusts , but for the economy - minded the extra size is also a bonus - - the crocs are practically indestructable and your child will get a lot of use out of them as he or she grows . my three year old got the lime green color and she wants to wear them all the time , even indoors and says they are " very comfy . " 
the crocs from mexico run small and have a very short strap . they look strange with so much footbed sticking out beyond the strap . see the pictures . 
you cant go wrong with crocs . i love to have my kids wear these in the summer outside . they are easy to clean . spray with a hose and dry and they are new again . 
crocs are so nice for wearing all summer ! they are so easy to clean . only down side is how big they are . for a toddler that doesn ' t pay attention to their shoes it ' s hard to keep them on their feet ( think grocery cart and dangling legs ) . all in all great product though . 
i purchased this for my 17 month old . it is the perfect shoe for him - easy to take off and on , light , washable ( with just a hose ) and cute . he loves the soft soled shoes , but these are easy for him to wear also . and they are just so much easier to get off and on than tennis shoes or even the leather soft shoes . i highly recommend this for small children . 
i purchased the crocs in lime green , size 1 for my son . his shoe size is definitely a size 1 , but the crocs are more like a size 2 or 3 . i think the 12 - 13 would have been a better fit . i wish i had known beforehand . but i ' m keeping them and my son loves them , so he ' ll just grow into them i guess . 
my granddaughter loves these crocs . she said " i am going to wear my pink shoes every day ' and she has done just that . and i was so very happy they ran large . if they hadn ' t they would have been just a little small for her . now she has room to grow . clean up is so easy and simple . just to the sink and rinse off . very , very pleased with this product . love crocs for myself and my plantar fsciitis is helped enormously with wearing them . 
makes 3 yr old a happy gal . she only wants to wear crocs after receiving the shoes . she runs fine in it . 
very practical solution for toddlers outdoors . run true to size . the color is vivid and stays bright . quite durable . will buy another pair for the next year summer . 
our very active 5 year old wears these everyday to summer camp for swimming , bike riding , climbing trees ect without socks or injuries . he simply loves them ! 
nice for my daughter , the only thing i have to returned itbecause too small for her . . so i have to get the next sizejust like this one . . . 
bought this for my toddler son , it is true to size durable and perfect for spring / summer months . he out grew his last pair so this is a replacement since it worked out so nicely last summer 
my little girl got these shoes because we were going to hawaii . she loves her & # 34 ; pink shoes & # 34 ; and wears them everywhere . these are just like adult crocs , they have held up and worked great . 
my son tried these on and they are a bit too big , but that ' s a good thing , because he will grow into them . they are not too big to wear right now and somewhat easy to put on . . 
bought this in a toddler 6 / / 7 for my 86cm 12kg 15 month old son . they seem a little big , but he is able to walk well in them and seems to really like them . but he likes all shoes ! he can get them on himself already , so that could be a good thing . arrived here in australia a week earlier than estimated arrival date . 
i bought these for my 2 . 5yr old and he loves these , and i love that he can put them on by himself . they run true to size and extremely light weight . 
bought a pair of cheaper knock offs that gave my 21 month old daughter blisters in a very short time . these shoes are fantastic ! they fit perfectly ( bought the 6 / 7 for her , she is a 6 . 5 in other shoes ) . i will definately be purchasing more of them . the bright pink looks awesome - - better than in the pics . 
i really like them for my 2 year old . they are easy for her to put on by herself they are kind of big for her but will work for later on for the beach . she loves them i got them for her since the onces she had we getting a little small . the color is exactly like on the picture too , definately recommend ! 
thank you , my nephew loves them . . . what else could i ask for ? i received them on time , the color is perfect , and crocs material is the best for kids . i recommend them . absolutely . thank you again . 
these are my daughters favorite shoes to wear . they are comfortable and she likes the color . my also has a pair and they are his favorite shoes as well . 
got these at a good price and now i love crocs . they are comfy and and strong . they clean well and when he outgrew them i bought them again . too cool . 
i have been purchasing crocs for my boys since they were barely walking . they love them , i love them and they hold up really well . my son lost a shoe at the mall and i replaced them with the same pair . totally worth it ! 
we have owned a number of crocs for our daughter and as she grows out of them we get her the next size up . she loved the pink color and have been living in them since we got them delivered . nice to get them at a discounted price . 
this is a great option for outdoor play for an infant and toddler . daycare doesn ' t allow sandals or open - toed shoes , but where we live it ' s very hot . so crocs are a great breathable option for hot outdoor play . i also love taking them when we go fishing or to the lake because our toddler can wear them in the water and it prevents slipping or stepping on a pointy rock . 
he ' s 2 , this is a replacement for the ones he had previously . they are the only shoes he will keep on his feet . and they ' re " boo " , his favorite color . enough said . 
since my son started wearing shoes crocs have been the brand for us . it is thanks to crocs that i got him to even wear shoes ! the color is vibrant and yes red is his favorite color . they fit perfectly and give him a better sense of independence ( which it seems is very important for a kindergardener ) as he can get them on and off on his own . now he needs to learn to tie his shoes ! thanks crocs ! 
i wear a size 5 1 / 2 adult shoe and these fit me perfectly . got them at a lower price than adult size and love the color ! 
love these shoes . they are so very comfortable . perfect shoe if you have any type of foot problems . thank you . 
i can ' t say anything bad about these crocs except maybe they a little more than what i would want to spend . they are great for kids . easy on , easy off , waterproof , cushiony . they run a little big i found but my kids grow into them . school and daycare have a no open - toe shoe policy so i buy these every spring for my kids . 
i bought these for my grandson . i like to have an extra pair of shoes at home for him in case he gets the shoes he ' s wearing muddy or wet . the only problem is he loves these shoes and ends up taking them home : ) this is the second pair i ' ve purchased this spring and i think they are truly worth the money i paid . they fit well , the shoes stay on , my grandson can put them on by himself and the shoes are well made . i ' ll be back to purchase more next year in a different size . 
my son loves these shoes . perfect for summer , swim class and pool . they are really comfy . ordering another pair . 
we spend a good amount of time transferring her gibbits ( sp ? ) from her smaller pair to this one , but love them . they are very durable , doesn ' t matter if they get wet or muddy , easy for her to put on , etc . etc . have been sold since her first pair three sizes ago ! 
the strap came off the first day of wearing . i know they come off sometimes but i ' ve not had them come off while still new . it comes off all the time now . i ' m keeping them and will try glueing the strap on , but am not pleased with the quality at all . i could have done better going to walmart and paying less . 
i choose the name . i haven ' t had a buxton wallet in years . so i tried again very happy and a fan . thank - you . 
i only wish it were two inches longer & # 8230 ; . but it ' s so perfect , and replaces one like it . i like the features . 
i love this wallet . it is perfect for my needs . i especially like the color red . i also love the zippers . it is a solid , sturdy and durable product . thank you 
this has a lot of compartments . i have always carried buxton . . they last forever . . good quality . . i would recommend this brand to everyone . . 
well designed , nice quality , and the red is a nice color . i really like how my drivers liscence and makeup mirror are in a handy little hidden holder that slides in and out safely without having to open my wallet . it fits all my cards and then some ! 
sending it back . getting a refund which is a plus . a little small for me . i kept losing things out of it such as money . 
i normally wouldn ' t buy this kind of wallet but chose this one because i was tired of the plastic photo insert in my current wallet falling out . this wallet has a two large zipper compartments - - aside from a small one the outside which can hold a little change and small one in the second larger compartment . i use the first large zipper compartment for credit cards and drivers license and cash , the second compartment holds the plastic photo insert from my prior wallet . i don ' t need access to the photo insert often but when i do it is there and the rest of the time it ' s protected from falling out . the manufacturer includes a small mirror that is attached and useless . that should be eliminated as it takes up space that could be better used . the leather itself is quite stiff , i hope with use it will become a bit more supple . 
this wallet has plenty of slots for your credit or store discount cards . however , the spacing was a bit off . i had a heck of a time fitting into and removing my cards from the slots . otherwise this wallet has it all : a slot for paper currency , a coin zipper compartment and of course multiple slots for cards . 
this wallet is the best . i can ' t believe how much stuff fits in here . i like the size of the wallet , fits easily into your purse or you can just grab it and run into the store ! exactly what i was looking for . both of the compartments zip closed so you don ' t loose anything inside ! 
this wallet is well made . but it was smaller than i expected it to be . i will still carry it in my smaller hand bags . i hope this helps . 
love kipling products and never had a problem with any of their bags . love everything about this bag , especially the color . 
this bag exceeds my expectations . i ordered it in black on amazon primarily because of the pockets and their locations . when it arrived , i wondered if all my stuff would truly fit inside nicely . it most certainly did . aside from the usual " lady stuff " , i can also fit my leather - bound kindle in it . and there ' s still plenty of room left ! the design of this bag was definitely well thought out . kudos to kipling . 
what more can i add that has not already been said about these bags . gorgeous bright red color , lots of space and compartments to put everything ( you just have to remember where you put them ) . fits most things that you can comfortably carry including ipap , camera , small bottle of drink , etc . thoroughly recommend . i took off the long shoulder strap as there seemed to be too much at the top and they got annoying . 
i can not say enough good things about this bag . it is spacious and roomy . lightweight when full compared to other bulky bags . believe the reviews . even if this bag is not " full " it still looks good and is functional with all the pockets . i have got to have pockets for everything . i have at least 9 different kipling bags . three of which are from 1994 and 1995 . they have held up so well over the years that people still mistake them for brand new . they can hold up to a jet set lifestyle or everyday laid back casual style . the material makes them easy to pack in a suitcase or fit into smaller lockers . i am a kipling fan for life ! 
i went through so many diaper bags , and they were clunky , big , and poorly organized . i wanted something that can both go cross - body and on your shoulder , and had easy pick up straps . i also wanted great visibility inside the bag and a nice , wide compartment . this bag is awesome ! it looks deceivingly small , yet i can throw in all the baby essentials , a couple of diapers , snacks , toys , plus my own stuff , and it holds everything . it ' s super lightweight , and even my husband doesn ' t mind carrying it . if you ' re looking for a smaller baby bag or just a roomy , well - organized purse , this bag fits the bill . and it ' s super cute , too ! love . 
i am really in love with this bag the color is beautiful and have a lot of pockets wich is my mainproblem with other bags is spacious and the best part you can washed in the washer machinei love this bag that i want to buy another blue . 
i got a lot of compliments from having this bag . pretty much like every female i encountered was like " where did you get that bag ? what is that monkey ? that ' s a kipling monkey ? what is a kipling monkey ? " i am doing this brand a lot of advertising ! i do actually own another kipling bag . it is a smaller size and i got it actually for around the same price . i was a dork and i did a thorough online bag review search . that ' s right . i researched which bags had the highest reviews and then sorted by price and function . i took the highest ranking items and did a cost - value comparison . there are actual websites devoted to this , so i ' m not the only one ! anyways , i went to some baggage specialty site and bought my first kipling then . this was a couple years ago . i used it for my travels abroad because i wanted to get something with a bunch of pockets . you know , so i could hold my valuables safe but in the open . bad guys would be fooled because i had so many decoy pockets . anyways - - - since then , i feel like kipling has improved even though they were awesome back then too ! this bag is about the price of other kipling bags ( around $ 78 at time of purchase ) . it is a bit more pricey , but it is still at a lower price point than the designer bags like coach or l v . i think this bag is a good day bag because it has many compartments . if you pick the right color , it can go with many wardrobe items . it is a bag that could blend in with casual wear and a little more formal wear . ( i took this to the streets of nyc and even to a 3 star michelin restaurant ! no one looked at me funny . ) nylon does feel thin though against the skin . i can see how some people may question whether or not nylon would be very durable if they are new to having a bag made of the fabric . my other bag ( that i bought years ago ) has still lasted . i just wanted a bigger bag to stuff more things into . the inside fabric color now , at least for the white bag , which i bought matches the color of the outside . i liked that . my older kipling bag had this green tint inside which i didn ' t like . but this bag seems to have improved to be more color coordinated inside and out . i found all the zippered pockets to be well placed and thought out . i could put small bills in the back . keep some receipts in the front . have a pouch left over for keys . put my phone inside the main compartment . slip in tissues into the fold in the main compartment . bring some paper soap along with me also in the fold in the main compartment . plus , stuff my sunglasses inside with much room to spare . in short , i love this handbag ! it is very functional . i would recommend this for someone who is traveling and needs to bring a lot with them to feel comfortable that she is not leaving something important behind . 
i did a lot of shopping around for " the purse " and decided on the kipling defea after much research . the thing that sold me the most was its ability to convert to a cross body bag , which i absolutely love . when i ' m at the groceries or mall , the last thing i want to do is have to carry a purse by hand or constantly have something slipping off my shoulder . the cross body strap lets me be perfectly hands free and unhindered . the defea has a main compartment , 2 smaller pockets ( with 1 zippered compartment in the front ) , 1 large zippered compartment in the back . inside , it was 3 pen / pencil slots , and even more compartments ! it ' s seriously amazing . i am able to fit a large 48oz water bottle , my wallet , cellphone in one of the front compartments , chapstick in the zippered , along with pens , paperwork , whatever . the defea is on the larger side , but when it ' s not holding a lot of stuff it lies pretty flat and doesn ' t look bulky at all . one of the best things about kipling is the nylon material it is made of . during a vacation , i had a pen explode inside . i simply took my things out , and used a wet napkin to wipe the ink off my bag . easy as that ! i haven ' t put it in the washer yet but i wouldn ' t hesitate to do that if the bag got too dirty . my mother in law loved my defea so much she decided to get one ( or two ) for herself . she ended up taking it to a wedding as her only carry on , as it was able to fit a lot of stuff when the clothes were tightly rolled up . best bag ever . i ' d like to buy more in different colors : ) 
been using this style for awhile now and i must say this bag has never let me down yet . tons of storage in it , pretty much holds everything i need . the main compartment i can always stuff to bursting and and it ' s still comfy to haul around cross - body like i do . not surprised this style endures . this brand is extremely well made and seems to last forever . when i retire this bag , i still have to find another worthy kipling replacement for this . 
i don ' t know where i would be without it . i ' m a one - handbag gal . i use this all of the time . it holds everything and is extremely well organized , i know where my iphone is , my dark glasses , my pepper spray , my drawing pencils , my medicines , and of course my wallet , also by kipling . i wanted this handbag for the longest time . i can fit my filofax in it , i can fit a drawing pad or journal , or overnight clothes and extra clothing for the next day . maybe not all at once ! my keys are always at hand . the grabby handles are how i get it out of the car , but i wear the over the head strap for carrying it around and just carry it off my hip . ( i ' m not hippy . ) it could not be better looking or more practical . love the black for me . i do wish i had bought red accessories , as the black ones are hard to find inside the purse . do make a note of that ! 
this bag is a must have for any busy , on the go young woman who wants a combination of practical and cool in her handbag . the space is awesome , and there are lots of little pockets to put things ! this is my bag for going to work . it is sturdy , reliable , classy , and dynamic . strong buckles and clasps and good solid zips ensure that this bag is going to last me many more years . i have no regrets paying this price for the bag . awesome bag . i recommend that you get it ! 
this purchase was actually for my mom , given as a valentine ' s day present , as she has been admiring mine ! she loves it ! i only buy kipling handbags , but seriously , of all , this is the one i love the most . so many compartments , and large enough to even house my ipad . i ' d give this a & # 34 ; 10 star & # 34 ; rating if it were possible . i have it in two colors . 
this is just a classic boot . my husband loves it . he tells me that the construction is padded in such a way that it is very comfortable around his ( bony ) ankles . he puts a lot of time on his feet and has found these boots to stay comfortable through the day . 
this is the 2nd pair i bought for my son . the pair last year are now work boots . the pair this year are clean . they are consistantly a great boot . comfortable and can take a beating . for some reason they make a fashion statement . a clean timberland boot goes great with jeans and a button down relaxed shirt . 
i received these timberland boots as a replacement for another style that i returned to the company which were found to be defective . i should have returned these as well but it costs too much to keep sending boots back . these boots have no padding nor arch support at all ! the soles wore out super fast . i ' m not sure they lasted 2 months . of all of the timberland boots that i have owned these are the lousiest . 
these are the best . hubby now has 3 pairs and loves them . he highly recommends these . 
glad i read these reviews so i knew to order size 11 . 5 for my husband ' s size 12 feet , the 11 . 5 ' s fit perfectly ! 
this is very nice waterproof boots from timberland , i love its style and look , and very comfortable to wear them on . for some people it might be little heavy but i love it . 
my son goes to college at university of maine where there is snow , and previously he , would not wear boots , until this year . he asked for these boots specifically . i did my homework , and got the waterproof timberlands . i also purchased a size smaller than his usual 12 , because other reviews of the boot , said that they run a size bigger . my son says the boots fit and he is very pleased . i love amazon . i was able to shop , right here in my warm home , and have the boots shipped directly to his college . easy breezy . done . happy mom , happy son , warm feet , warm heart . 
got these boots , and wow ! they appeared to be well made . note : boots are not made in the usa as i thought , but rather , made in the dominican republic . boots are very comfortable , but i got a wide fit , and maybe could have gone with a regular width . i normally wear ee or w width shoes , so note to users , these boots tend to fit on the wider side . maybe wearing thicker socks will fill in the shoe better . however , the opening of the boot is rather narrow , and putting them on is a bit of a struggle , as the ankle part of the boot is made rather narrow . i ' ve had timberline ' s before and these are not as nice as the originals ( back in the early 90 ' s ) . 4 out of 5 as that ' s the only knock against these boots . otherwise , sole is top notch quality , and the uppers are top quality new buck . 
i bought these for my son for christmas . he loves them and says they are just what he expected from the boot . 
fit is good , color is bright . husband likes so far but hasn ' t worn too much . will maybe write more later 
havent had a pair of tims as comfortable in several years . i am very pleased with this purchase . would reccomend to anyone that asks 
great quality , did what other reviewers said and ordered a size small . the boot was a little tight at first , but had then stretched out at a shoe smith and now they fit perfectly . no complaints ! 
these are the most fantastic boots . true to size , great colour , great style . my son wore them out for the first time and it was raining . we were worried that the boots would mark as there were wet marks on them , they dried clean , not a mark , it was fantastic . i would highly recommend them to all . 
i have been buying timberland boots for my son for years ; but this means , these are only his third pair . previously , i purchased the standard golden boots ; this is the first time i bought the ultra - suede , at his request . he really wanted black boots but , did not want to look like a storm trooper . we fixed on these because the grommets ( those metal pieces around the shoelace holes ) were smooth and subtle - looking , and the sole did not protrude past the upper . i was unaware the ankle padding would be brown but , this was a pleasant surprise to both of us ! as he commented , ' now they look less like nazi boots . ' they provide good support but , we needed to add a padded insole . he wanted to wear these right away , before they were treated . so , i will be cleaning them with jason markks product , and spraying with scotchguard . i will publish the results . ( i purchased the jason markks product directly from them , as amazon doesn ' t sell the boar bristle brush recommended by them for use on suede . ) 
i have an extremely wide foot and i need good ankle support . this boot fits both requirements at a great price . it ' s not too heavy and feels great ! i am very pleased with this purchase ! 
followed the advice in other reviews that these run a little large . ordered half a size smaller and they fit about right . durable and extremely stylish at the same time . perfect when you want to be casual and dress to impress at the same time . spend the extra money and get these - well worth it . 
i think it runs half size big , and i recommend e not d , the leather is cool so does the color . love it 
my son loves this and very comfortable . some boots are hard to decide and how they feel but this one fit nicely and warm too . 
met all my expectations in style and fit . the sizing chart is exact so no worries when ordering on line . 
these shoes cost about $ 90 and timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . to add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper . one could buy rockport , nunn bush , florsheim , deer stags , etc . all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed ! 
the shoes are tremendous . they are comfortable and surefooted , as well as appearing to be well constructed . i tried other brands , but they don ' t measure up , with the possible exception of rockports . i wish they offered an insulated version . 
perfect fit , color is very nice , looks like an updated boat shoe . my husband loves them says they are extremely comfortable . my grandson and his two friends came over ( they are 25 years old ) and they thought they were great and that they would even be good for golfing . my grandson wants me to order a pair . 
very attractive shoes the build quality is just unbelievable fits perfect and look good all the time i have been ask every time i wear it wear i bought those shoes they are attractive and very masculine its an old time classic glad i found them in the timberland brand 
a nice casual shoe for school or work , the shoe was bought for my teenage son . he wears a size 12 . 
i have not worn this style of boat shoe since 1989 thru 1991 when i owned both colors at that time , as soon as i opened the box from amazon i fell in love once again , i see people here complaining about a few things but i dont see one problem whatsoevet , so what if it is not made in the u . s , and big deal if it is not a vibram sole no more , that dont mean nothing , aint nobody in the street going to notice any of that nonsense , some people just complain about everything , and then all of a sudden they stop you from buying an item , the shoe met all od my expectations , it is a timeless classic that never goes out of style ! 
a 10 m should fit me , but it was so long my heels came up in the back . . trying to decide whether or not to reorder it in a smaller / wider size and how far down to go . . maybe i ' ll go to a shoe store and find the right size when the snow stops ! 
my husband loves these shoes , and we have purchased three pairs in the past five years . they are comfortable and look great with jeans or slacks . 
hubby really likes these shoes . we buy them year after year . amazon prime is the easiest way ! i don ' t have to drag him to the store to try on lots of shoes ! 
if you ' re tired of those walmart $ 30 shoes that last 6 months , maybe , then you owe it to your feet to get these . i noticed the price has gone up , but they are still worth it . perfect fit and very comfortable . thanks amazon . 
i received the nun bush shoes and i was in love with the fit . wide enough for by huge feet and very comfortable . price was right . and they look fantastic and represented a higher priced shoe . i can walk all day with these shoes and no problem . and thats what i bought them for . very satisfied . 
my husband is wide / strange feet . he has had issues with them off and on . he walks a lot at work . he has tried various brands and styles . likes these best . he has been wearing them now for a number of years . just keeps buying some shoe now . they are soft so the leather has some give which allows them to kind of & # 34 ; mold & # 34 ; to his foot . he has them in both black and brown . 
these shoes are solid and comfortable . they are well constructed and should last a long time . great to wear casually with jeans or chinos . the removable gel footbed is supportive but once removed suitable for orthotic users . i would recommend them to people who spend long hours on their feet . 
i have been buying camerons for many years . they are competitive with other quality shoes at a much better price . they always fit as expected and require no break in . extremely durable . 
my husband has very bony ankles and most shoes come up too high and really bother him . i found these for him about 10 years ago and i still buy him the same style when his old ones wear out . though , in all that time wearing them to work every day , i think this is only the 3rd pair . 
i can ' t recall when i bought my first nb cameron , but it ' s probably been 10 + years ago . i like them so much i stock up whenever they ' re on sale . they ' re a shoe but feel like a running shoe . the browns are my favorite ( actually only ) casual shoe and i just bought the black to push the envelope a bit as a dress shoe . i recommend this shoe without hesitation . if you need a wide toe box , as i recently learned that i do , this is an excellent choice . 
this is a roomy , comfortable shoe for the money . just watch the size - it runs big . i wear 11 . 5 , but in this shoe , 11 is plenty . 
the shoes are great and wear well . i have been wearing them for years and continue to buy them over and over when they need to be replaced . . . 
i like this shoe so much that this is my 2nd pair although i sold my boat years ago . the first pair , 2 years old , is a bit beaten up but still worn for yard work and other household chores . these shoes are perfect for nice casual wear . this color combination goes nicely with tan dockers or jeans . the fit is great , the support is good . you can wear them all day in comfort . this is my go - to shoe ! 
bought this because it has narrow width . not as narrow in the 9 as we had hoped . sturdy good shoe . maybe worth the retail $ 100 because of leather and very well made 
nice looking , but a little too two - toned for me , so i used brown shoe polish on the light tan leather parts and now they look like what i expected , a traditional brown boat shoe . very comfortable , especially the more they ' re worn . i always have a couple pair of these shoes on hand and i live in them . 
my husband is frugal and fussy . he ' s had a pair of these shoes for a few years ; they were purchased secondhand in medium width . ( we didn ' t know they were available in wide . ) he ' s very happy with the way these fit , and he was happy with the price , too . the older pair lasted as long as similar - style boat shoes that cost almost twice as much ; he ' ll probably keep these new ones for the rest of his life . 
i ' ve been a rockport & sperry leather shoe man ; i always needed arch supporter . sebago was wide enough and with a better arch . as a pastor i ' m on my feet a lot and really need a solid foundation as it affects every part of body from arch to top of head so it was nice to find such a quality product . i won ' t be backslidding to rockport or sperry . 
gave these a 5 because i have extra wide feet and they came in wide and fit perfectly . i have a high instep , and even though they lace , i still have plenty of room . they offer great support and traction . will buy again . the color combo is also good - looking , so the wife says . 
hi recived my size 9 sebago boat shoes look great half size smaller would have been a better choice however what a great shoe so comfortable great service from amazon only 5 days from usa to australia already orded senond pair thanks amazon 
i have been wearing these for about a month and they are fitting pretty good . vented on the sides so the feet get a little air . i would recommend these shoes . 
sebago boat shoes are incredibly durable . my last pair lasted me almost 15 years before the sole wore down and it was decision time to replace the sole or buy a new pair for nearly the same price . i bought the clovehitch and it ' s a very nice shoe . it works in most business settings other than true business formal affairs where wingtips or other dressy shoes are expected . 
these shoes look great when my husband wears his light colored shorts , like cream , white , or the palest tan . he has many havana / cuban / hawaiian shirts with a pale background as well , so these sebago boat shoes will match a lot of his summer clothes . 
these shoes are so comfortable and are true to size . my husband wears a 12 w which are hard to find in stores so amazon had them for half the price as in stores . high recommend these shoes ! 
these are easily the most comfortable boat shoes i ' ve ever worn , as well as any other type of shoe . agreeing with another reviewer , they seem just a hair wider than a normal " d " width . this is only noticeable with thin or no socks . otherwise they are fabulous . 
this is the second pair i have purchased & i live in them 6 days a week . it was hard to get my size on the first order . they are sold in an " e " size , but shipped in a " w " size , but i will order another pair in a few years . thanks 
bought this for my husband as a present , it fits him well and he loves it . he just find a little imperfection , the left shoe seems like darker than the right one but we keep it anyway coz it fits well to my husband . 
these are my go - to non - work shoes and i wear them all the time . however , i did have to exchange them at first . they do seem to run a bit more narrow than other shoes , but this wasn ' t a problem as they were available in all sizes . the construction also seems great . i ' m going on three months and having no real wear or problems . 
i ordered a 14b or narrow shoe . when i received them they felt too big . i looked at the shoe box and it said they were 14b and i looked at the label on the shoes and it said 14b . i can tell you after wearing 14b for most of my life these shoes are not 14b but 14d . i really like the shoes and was not happy sending them back . 
they look good and every now and then i use them , but they are a bit too small and it makes no sense when i have merrell ' s that are so comfortable . they are too good to throw out or give to my local charity , but not good enough to use much . they appear to be very well made . if you buy them , i suggest you get one size larger than usuall . 
when you have feet that are almost as wide as they are long it ain ' t easy finding any shoes that fit . these came out of the box , on my feet , and away we went . they ' re very comfortable , and i feel stylish . if you have wide feet , you ' ll like them . 
was in need of boat shoes and these were a great match for the price . i ' ve had them for about 2 or 3 years and they have held up against the test of time . the shoe holds up great , but the inserts need replacing . if i can replace them i will or get a new pair 
this is a replacement for the identical pair that my husband wears . he loves the style and has worn through several pairs of these in the last many years . i just hope they keep making this same style and that the quality doesn ' t deteriorate ! 
i ordered these as a surprise , and told my husband he was welcome to start wearing them now or wait until the ones he bought wore out . he liked these much better because they are much better looking than the ones he purchased on & # 34 ; sale & # 34 ; at a local store . 
these shoes are very comfortable and have stood up to almost 2 years of use . after only a week or two of use , the white paint on the side of the rubber sole began to flake and peel off . this is my only issue with the product , but it made them look a bit cheap . 
very attractive shoe and they feel like i have been wearing them for a year , would i buy another / sure would 
both my son and husband have narrow feet and these shoes work well for them . quick break in time is a plus ! 
these are good shoes at an excellent price . the inner lining is a little rough and , in my case , required a fair amount of breaking in . 
i purchased 2 pairs . one paid the left shoe is not the same as the right . it looks like they used the toe piece from a d width shoe on the 2e . the shoe seems to fit ok but it looks like hell . my wife had already thrown out the boxes or i would have returned them for an exchange . 
i think i would buy anything sebago makes ! the outstanding quality and comfort is unbeatable . i have size 14xw hard to fir feetand these and the other pair of sebago ' s i bought love my feet . the leather is so soft . i definitely recommend these and the whole sebago brand . wg . 
fits good , very comfortable , looks good and price was right . not much more to add than that , its a pair of shoes 
minnetonka fits very well . it is good product . i did have one pair before , but size was small . this time i have ordered one size larger , fits okay 
no arch support , flat , very flexible , perfect if you enjoy barefoot type shoes . they look very durable and are nice enough to wear on most every occasion . i normally take a 9 . 5 but the 9 m are definitely my size . i do recommend this shoe as a comfortable walking shoe . 
i just wanted to say this is a super product the moccusons wear a perfect fit well made for the price . exc . as i order . 
these shoes were replacements for a larger pair that i had ordered and returned . i wear a size 9m in most all of my shoes but apparently a size 8 in these . these were nice looking shoes but did not run true to size . 
i bought these for my hubby to wear around the house . what a good buy they were . . . and they shipped so fast . he was so happy to see them . the shoes were comfortable and perfect for lazy sunday mornings . thanks amazon for making it so easy . 
i love minnetonka sandals , i ' ve been wearing them for most of my adult life . there ' s always have a pair or two in my closet , one for knock around and one for casual outings . they fit my feet perfectly , are comfortable and just for good measure , they look great too . 
my original pair of camp mocs was a size 9 medium and they were a bit too tight but wearable . i needed slightly longer and wider shoes . so , when i decided to get another pair i ordered a size 9 . 5 medium . when they arrived i was shocked to find that they were now much too big ! a half size change and my feet are now swimming in these mocs . i sent them back and didn ' t request another size because , frankly , i ' m not sure what size to order . these are wonderful moccasins but , unfortunately , i can ' t seem to get past the sizing issues . so , i ' ve deducted one star because it seems i ' m not the only one who experienced size discrepancies . 
nicely constructed , however very low - cut . when walking , each step causes them to flex in a way the makes them feel loose and uncomfortable . prefer a moccasin that snugly wraps around my foot with laces or a boat shoe . amazon paid for the return , thanks . 
my husband was introduced to these shows some 10 years back and since has not bought another pair . this is his everyday , all time footwear . he even tried to wear it to the gym ! 
i bought this boot for a slightly higher price that it is listed now , but at a much lower price than anywhere online . i was so pleased that it arrived within 3 days of ordering , and that it matched the first reviewer ' s description : don ' t second guess ! i wore these boots for about 6 hours the first time i wore them , and did some moderate walking downtown . i did not get any blisters or pain like new shoes normally give . they are a nice leather , have a nice , skid resistant sole , and are probably the most high quality dress boots i own . what a deal ! 
i listened to the other reviewers and ordered this boot in my actual size ( i did not go up a half size like some had suggested ) . i love them ! they are comfy and stylish . i recommend them highly ! 
love these boots . they are totally comfortable , and they fit to size . the heel is a bit higher than i wanted , but b / c of how comfortable they are , it doesn ' t matter . 
i must say i am not very happy with these boots at all . i am surprised considering all the good reviews . the boots are way too big in the heel and very wide around my ankle . when i walk in these the extra material in front pushes inward and pokes my ankle . i could only wear for moments . . . these will be returned a . s . a . p . 
the item was delivered quickly and without any problems . i am very happy ! 
i had been searching high & low for a year or two for a comfortable , versatile pair of leather boots under $ 50 . something to wear with jeans and long skirts . then i found these on sale for eighteen bucks ! after carefully reading reviews , i ordered my regular dress shoe size ( 8 . 5m ) in the black . it fit perfect for a boot . . . not too tight , not too loose , just right . the heel height is also perfect . . . not too high , not to0 low , just right . the boots are versatile . . . not too casual , not too dressy , just right . highly recommend these boots . comfortable shoe , perfect fit , great price . 
ok , i ' m going to have to agree with the majority of the people on here , these boots are absolutely gorgeous . they ' re comfortable and the heel is just right , not too high . the leather is soft and supple adding to the comfortable feel of the boots . my only advice in purchasing them is to size up a . 5 " . i got these in my normal size 7 but i had to return them because they were too tight in the toe section . i got them in a 7 . 5 " and they were a perfect fit . so other than the fact that the boots are not exactly true to size , i would highly recommend them . 
these are the answer to a stylish clog for those of us who can ' t wear open - back shoes . they don ' t need " breaking in " and have excellent support - i can wear them without my usual orthotics - and they won ' t wear out ! 
first shoe i could wear all day . it fit like a glove and gave me the perfert support i have been looking for . perfect for an office atmosphere . just wish they came in another color . 
i walked these wonderful shoes like they were the only pair i owned and after years i had to let them go . this is my second pair and once again i am wearing these as if they are the only pair of shoes i own . the picture of them is not the greatest but trust me they look awesome in person and the fit is like a glove and the price i was sold . 
i love these shoes . i ' m on my third pair . i heard that merrell discontinued this shoe and i don ' t understand why . they also had a boot version of the spire that was great and it is definitely discontinued . argh ! if anyone from merrell is reading - please keep making the spire . i love the arch support . i wear these with my orthotics and they work great together . my one and only complaint about the shoes that the tread starts to separate from the shoe and wear out before the rest of the shoe does . other than that i absolutely adore the shoes i wear them at least 4 days a week . i wear them to work with slacks . i wear them with jeans . i can walk miles in the shoes and feel really comfortable . 
i ordered this shoe in a size 10 . i normally wear a 9 . 5 , but ordered a 1 / 2 size up to be sure it fit . when i received the shoe i tried it on and could barely squeeze my foot into it . i couldn ' t believe a size 10 didn ' t fit . i had to return it so i didn ' t get to actually wear it . the shoes appeared to be of quality construction , but unfortunately they did not work for me . 
i bought these directly from merrell many years ago andi am still wearing them . they really are my go to shoe , as others described . i also do a logo f walking for work . the only thing that i don ' t like is the big ball shape of the heel and the way the rubber runs up the back . i went onto the merrell website and they stopped making them for some reason . i have purchased a lot of different merrel shoes through the years and i love them . i am sure that i will buy more . 
i first saw this shoe in the store while looking for something to wear to work . it is impressive in it ' s support of the foot but also in comfort . those two don ' t often go together . with slacks , this shoe looks sleek and neat - almost like a boot . i like the soft collar around the opening ; it makes the shoe really easy to put on and keeps it in place as well . they are strong but not stiff . good arch support and plenty of room in the toe box . especially good for cold weather . the sole has good tread so i feel safe in rain or even when it ' s icy . i wear these for dress wear with black slacks and can go anywhere . 
this is my second pair of these shoes . i love them ! i was afraid they wouldn ' t still be there when the first pair wore out so i already purchased a back - up . i can walk forever in these shoes and i have bad feet ! i wear them most every day to work and they still look good after almost 2 years . what a value ! 
i have had these since 2002 and wear them often . i ' ve had to re - dye the toe portion but they ' ve fared really well . i paid around $ 70 back in 2002 and have been worth every penny ! 
i work in an office setting so i actually don ' t walk very much in these shoes but i wear them about 4 times a week . they are very comfortable and don ' t set off security alarms when walking through ( a huge plus for me ) but within a few months i began to feel ashamed to wear them because they started to look scraggly . also the sole is coming loose from the shoe and i ' ve even wondered about buying some glue . for the money i ' m disapointed in the wear . if more quality were put into these i ' d buy them over and over . i will say that i own several merrell and love them all . it ' s hard for me to find shoes i can wear all day from the moment they come out of the box without breaking them in in some way but so far i ' m able to do that with merrill ! i do buy a 1 / 2 size larger than normal though because for me they are made small . just wish they held up better . that being said i find i can ' t bring myself to buy merrell anymore . the soles do not last , they come loose , the leather is so thin white comes through . . it ' s just a shame ! these are really made much like a very cheap shoe would be and they do not last . 
i hurt my foot recently and needed some shoes with good support . i had another pair of merrells that were more of a mary jane style and like them very much . these however , are too hard to slip on ( i have a slightly high instep . ) and if you are wearing socks , the stretchy part sticks to your sock , and by the time your foot gets into the shoe , your socks are strangling your toes . i tried making my socks too - long , then shoving my foot in these , but it still didn ' t work . plus after i got them on , it felt like the top of my foot was held too tightly , but the sides were slightly wide . i even have slightly narrow feet ( not a true narrow size ) and still found them difficult to put on . once on , they were just a little clunky and not bendable enough for my taste . i have tried to wear them a few times , but couldn ' t wait to take them off . not painful , just annoying . . . almost like wearing a hard ace bandage all day . i was disappointed because i did need the support of a shoe like this . and half sizes aren ' t always easy to find in this brand . i guess i will just wear my other pair more often . bummer . 
these shoes are nice , however , the fit is way too small ! i got a half size larger than what i need and it is still too small . i recommend getting a full size larger than needed and wearing thin socks . also , it was said in another post that i read that the arch support is great . i honestly do not agree . i felt the arch , but it was not that supportive . i am returning my pair . 
the merrell spire stretch is the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn ! i am now on my fourth pair and when these eventually wear out , i will absolutely , positively buy them again . i dread the thought that merrell will discontinue them ! ( note : 5 - 7 - 10 merrell has discontinued these shoes ! ! ! ! ! buy them while you can ! ! ! ! ) i purchased my first pair when i developed neuropathy of the feet several years ago . my feet ached and burned so much that i couldn ' t wear any of my shoes for more than a few minutes before feeling painful pressure . . . . on the toe . . . . on the arch . . . . . on the heel . a shoe salesman suggested the spire . i put a pair on and it was love at first step ! i wore these shoes every day , all day for over a year . i virtually lived in them and they allowed me to maintain a normal , active lifestyle despite my foot problems . the spire is really a bootie . the top is a stretch neoprene - like cuff that reaches up over the foot almost to the ankle bone . this cuff is soft but supportive and it keeps the shoe securely on the foot . there is absolutely no pressure placed on the foot or toes and yet the shoe is extremely supportive . as if you were wearing an oxford . the design is pure genius ! the toe box is high and broad and the heel is about 2 " high , air cushioned and very " solid " underfoot , comfortable but not squishy . importantly , the spire benefits from the q - form last that merrell has designed specifically for women . the q - form holds the foot at the correct angle preventing strain on the ankle , knee and hip joints . not all of merrell ' s womens shoes have this last . i think it ' s a very importatnt feature . when i try on a new merrell shoe , i always make sure it ' s q - form . the spire comes in regular and thinsulate lined versions . it also comes in two zip up thinsulate lined boot styles . a half boot that rises a few inches above the ankle and a knee boot . i own the zip half boot and i find it very warm and comfortable . the spire used to come in black and brown , but is only offered now in black . if i had one complaint it would be that the sole wears out after a year of very hard pavement use . since the sole is molded , it cannot be re - soled . the shoe needs to be replaced . finally , the spire is probably the best looking , least dorky , comfort shoe - bootie you will find . . . . . if you squint it even looks a bit like prada ! and it is much , much more comfortable ! i am amazed to see how many fashionable women wear spires with their pants while they walk the hard pavement sidewalks of manhattan . i ' d like to include myself among them ! 
i wear a size 10 . 5 & # 34 ; shoe , ordered these in 10 . 5 & # 34 ; , and they fit perfectly . nike makes their insoles a bit different than other companies though , the arch support is more in the outside of the arch rather than in the middle , which works fine for me , but some people might need a more centered arch support . i run with a heel - to - toe stride and these absorb impact , and rolls nicely off the ball of my foot . these aren ' t life changing shoes or anything , but they work great for casual runners such as myself . i ' ve already put 27 miles on them and they are holding well . 
fits perfectly even though i have slightly high arches and not exactly narrow feet . the materials are good quality and overall you hardly feel any weight on your feet . the heel part of the sole is designed interestingly , it accommodates a slightly angles heel stride which is great for running . just feels a little odd when you first put them on . maybe it ' s a standard thing with running shoes . i just wasn ' t used to it but it feel just right when you are out and running . nothing pokes my foot inside in any way , nothing rubs uncomfortably . perfect shoe for me . 
this shoe is very light and comfortable . i normally wear a size 13 and ordered a 13 - - the shoe fits perfectly . 
as always this shoes were what i was expecting , very confortable and very good quality too . another thing that i ike is that they are very ligth for running . 
these shoes were shipped quickly , came in their box and were even cooler than i thought . the nike swoosh glows in the dark ! i ' m very happy . 
i alredy had an idea of the type of athletic shoes i wanted , i know what size nikes fit me , so that is not a problem . i am constantly being emailed by 3 shoe companys , but what is on deal to me price - wise , is no deal . on a whim , i went on - line to amazon and found several styles i liked , at the prices i liked . the " good " pair i was wearing were white . ( not good for winter mess . ) so i wanted black . i like this syle and the price that was offered , so i went ahead and ordered them . i was happy when they showed up a day before i was given as the delivery date ! ( some how , i ripped the sole loose on my other ' s the day the new ones were delivered ! these are not only comortable , thaey are light . it ' s like wearing slippers . 
my son has extremely wide feet and the extra wide shoe is one of the few that actually fit him so i bought 3 pairs . 
nice price , excellent show i love it . buy it with out any question . nice for walk , very light . good quality . 
these sneakers are exactly as they ' re pictured , lightweight , fit as expected , packaged correctly , no flaws , so far no complaints . good price on amazon . i recommend them . 
runs small , order a whole size bigger . i normally wear a 10 . 5 and order 11 . 0 when i know something runs small but i should have ordered 11 . 5 with these . otherwise not a bad shoe and the white ones are 50 . 00 and prime eligible 
i have a wide foot and these were tight ; i returned them . 
these not only look great on , but they fit perfect , nice material , very well made , and very happy i bought them . would recommend them to anyone that enjoys a nice looking pair of shoes and is looking for comfort . . im diabetic so that is very important to me . 
nike men ' s nike downshifter 5 running shoes 10 . 5 ( black / black / white / mtllc . . . 
advent walker and runner . bought them , i rotate brands of shoes as the sets of wears out , i can write reviews . normally , asics , brooks and new balance running shoes , i wear out within 9 to 12 months on asphalt and concrete , 2 miles runs and 5 miles walks . i worn out the nike sets in 4 month . bad sets of batch shoes , made in china . i ' ll stick will new balance , made in america , support my local economy and my country . thank you . 
the shoes are perfect ! the shoes were a gift for my son and he loves them very much . they are perfect ! 
great shoe for the price and name brand . these shoes breath with the cloth material on the top of the shoe . i love them . 
these boots fit well , look great and you can polish them to nice shine . look good with the uniform . only problem is the snap flap which is very hard to make snap once you have the boots on . 
bought these before and i will buy them again . if your looking for a really comfortable boot that ' s not heavy , this boot isn ' t for you . but it polishes great and looks good in dress uniform 
arrived on time and well packaged . shoes fit and are comfortable / side zipper strong enough to last or at least we will find out . looks great and son has no complaints . thanks for great service 
the boot looks great and is really well - made . however , it ' s just too large , even when wearing heavy socks . order a size down unless you like a lot of room in your boots . 
these were very poorly packaged and were a little damaged when i got them . they look really cheap in person . mine were missing the zipper pull on one side , and the insoles were too large for the boots so that they buckled up . i returned them immediately . the return process was somewhat convoluted , but i did get my money back about a week later . 
these boots are great easy to put on & rugged . i only have one problem is that the front & back panels are too shiny , but that is probably my fault should have paid more attention to the photo . 
it is very difficult to find large women ' s boots , so i have always worn men . however , men ' s boots are very wide on my feet . i was very excited to find these . i normally wear an 11 , but attempted the 10 because that is what the size chart said i needed and they fit perfectly . didn ' t require any breaking in period , but since i work on an island i did buy leather waterproofing cream to extend the life of my boots . the leather is very flexible allowing me to accomplish anything and everything my job requires ( squatting , climbing , balancing , running , walking , etc ) . i wear them all year long in every weather condition and they are very comfortable . my feet are plenty warm , but they don ' t breath quite as well as i would have liked . the zipper is super handy , i just slip my shoes on in the morning and off when i get home . no more sitting there for 5 minutes trying to relace my boots . the shoe laces that came with the boots were terrible . they were too short and the plastic ends looked like they were chewed up . so , i bought new 72 " laces so i can tuck in the extra . would definitely recommend for any woman on her feet for extended periods . 
i purchased these because im starting a emt program and needed sturdy shoes . these are so so comfortable out of the box . they also are good looking as tactical boots can be ! light as stated , and i wear a size 8 , but in boots i always order up 1 / 2 to 1 size also being ordered online who knows ? ? ? ? so a size 1 / 2 to 1 up is safe to fit me . i don ' t mind my boots a bit bigger i can wear thick socks . i wear these on my off / days too . 
i have had similar boots by other companies . even though i eventually loved them , it would take me truly weeks to break them in , with many serious blisters and attempts to improve the fit with various soles / socks etc along the way . these fit perfectly , at once , no breaking in period at all , good tread , good support . 
love the boot and the quick release zipper on the side . i wear these for everything that requires water proof shoes . . . not to mention during tactical maneuvers . so far they have held up longer than i do for my training ! 
i had to get insoles but i love the side zip . comfortable and easy to put on . lightweight . woman ' s work boots are hard to find . 
i got these boots for a friend , and she loves them they fit great and feel great . 
the only problem i ' ve got is with the way these boots are advertised and posted . after looking at dozens of styles it gets confusing as to which features come on which boots . as for the boot itself , marvelous . not steel toe , so be careful , because they look just like the ones with . excellent in every other aspect . water proof , comfortable out of the box . after 6 months of wear , still fit great and haven ' t lost their shape or comfort . ( this is a second pair which shows how much they ' re liked ) . 
great watch . 
bought this for him and he says he likes it . very low price for an automatic watch . attractive too . recommended 
i had this watch for about 10 days now and am not wearing any of my others . and this is the most inexpensive of the lot by many multiples . it has kept virtually perfect time for the 10 days and i never had to reset it as i expected would be necessary from an an inexpensive automatic . it is very light on the wrist and while the numbers are kinda ridiculous for normal people , i tend to tell time by the position of the hands . i highly recommend for what it is recognizing it is not a tag or rolex . only minor issue is that the watch is only slightly water resistent . so now showering or swimming with it . i had bought and returned the larger more expensive ( and more jewels ) version of this , a seiko snz series . i * t kept terrible time and would not run longer than about 6 hours once you took it off your wrist . no problems like that with this self - winding watch . 
beautiful watch . bought it for myself , but the wife loves it and it also fits . a bit bigger for a ladies watch , but still a good fit . 
one of the best all around watch movements ever made , i have had a $ 1000 automatic gevril - 2 which quit running after 2 years , only to find out it is $ 600 to repair it . i love these seiko 5 watches , choose your favorite design with confidence , the watch will last you a long time . 
i ' ve had my seiko automatic beige watch for a little while now . just time enough to note that after manually winding it by whirling it around ( can ' t wind it with the knob ) , setting the time and date , and wearing it on my dominant arm i have found it to be exceeding my expectations since it is quite accurate each day which , in low priced mechanical watches , is unbelieveable . i have some experience with home repair of watches , including a " watch wrench " to remove the back , so i was planning to have to adjust the timing accuracy . if you look through the glass back , you will see a small two pronged lever with some markings on the opposite side . move the lever to the " + " side if it is too slow . but so far it is not necessary . i did have some difficulty getting it to turn over to the next day / date at midnight instead of at noon . no matter when i set it , morning or evening it continued to turn over at noon . i finally let the movement run down ( took 27 hours on my bureau top ) and , since i knew when it would turn over next , i wound it at the proper time and it now changes day / date properly at midnight . i didn ' t have this trouble with my first seiko automatic , the one with the black face and using the 7s26c movement . the right way , i recently found out from another reviewer is : setting the watch is easy , just make sure you get the am / pm right on it , set the day / date a day earlier and then advance the time until it flips them and then set the time . voil & agrave ; ! it uses the 7s26b seiko movement , called the " ak47 " of mechanical watch movements . it can , according to my observation with my first seiko automatic watch with the same movement , stay within a seven seconds a day . this is my second seiko with the 7s26 movement . the first , the one with the black face , came from the factory just 7 seconds slow . if you spend thousands on some swiss brands ( most of which use a standard swiss made movement ) , you can get adjustment down to less than 3 seconds daily . but 80 dollars vs 800 dollars or even 8 , 000 dollars ? let ' s get real ! i ' m planning to replace the strap , which is comfortable and well designed , with a leather band or a metal expansion band . it deserves a better wrist band because it is a remarkable little device . this is what everyone wore before digital watches became common in the seventies . who knows how long it will last . this is the model t of automatic wrist watches . i ' m going to enjoy it for however long it runs . i think there ' s a certain cachet in mechanical watches in our digital world . i expect i will enjoy the risk of wearing this throwback to the mechanical era . digital be damned . update : i ' ve been wearing this seiko automatic watch for long enough to time it . my best measurement of it ' s accuracy is that it is within 2 seconds accurate each day . i don ' t know what to say - i certainly didn ' t expect an eighty dollar mechanical watch to be almost as accurate as a high priced swiss watch . i ' ll have to keep monitoring its accuracy for the next week or two and let you know . this is astounding accuracy for a low priced mechanical watch . to boot , it has give me no trouble whatsoever . from just wearing it 24 / 7 as is my custom , it has kept running perfectly with no additional winding other than the original winding ( which is what the instructions tell you to do - i wonder how many of the people who complain about it don ' t do that ) . then , too , it ' s a good looking watch with the dull stainless case and the tan face . the wrist band is more comfortable than a leather or metal band . i ' m truly sorry for the few people who were disappointed in their seiko automatic watch , but i ' m psyched - i feel like i got a rolex at timex price ! 
i tend to buy watches on sale and picked up this one for $ 49 and change about a month ago . it has been an excellent performer in this time period , averaging about 6 secs per day fast . the watch has a very readable face and the nylon band is quite comfortable . . . it ' s so light , you almost forget you ' re wearing it . i have 4 other seiko 5 series watches and of all of them , this one is the most accurate and cheapest one of the bunch . get it on sale if you can ! 
this watch has a great look and it is obviously a quality product . the band fits well and the overall watch has a very classy , yes casual , feel . one concern that i have noted , since it is an automatic watch , if not worn everyday , it does stop . i was hoping i would be able to take it off for a day or two and not have to worry about resetting the time . other than this minor issue , which is easily remedied by either wearing it more often or resetting the time , i have no regrets about this purchase . 
i loved this watch . i bought it because i wanted an automatic , durable watch that i could wear forever . it looked great . unfortunately , it just stopped working after several months . that happened to a seiko diver ' s watch i bought several years ago , too . as two seiko automatic watches have failed on me , i won ' t ever go back to that brand again . my citizen quartz watches , with solar energy collection , are great & # 34 ; automatic & # 34 ; alternatives that are much more reliable . 
i ' ve lost count of the number of these in various colors i ' ve bought . pair it with a quality nato band and you have a very stylish timepiece on the cheap . i ' m trying to work up a band trade exchange among my nieces . good fun ! 
i wanted a watch that has a clear and easy to read face , with a second hand and it had to glow . i would have preferred to have the 1 - 12 digits printed on the outer circle rather than the 60 second digits . i also appreciate the day of the week as well as the number day . i do like the color of both the watch face and the band . the band however gets a big ding for being terribly scratchy . i actually had to use a nail file to smooth some particularly bothersome areas . this made it more comfortable , but left it frayed . the scratchy band made me re - position it frequently . i like the brushed stainless steel case ; i think it is very attractive and will not show wear . price was a big factor in choosing this watch as i plan to wear it for work only . 
not much to say that a zillion other earlier reviewers haven ' t already fully covered . this watch is so popular for some great reasons . so count me in as one more plus vote . this is a great little automatic watch . i can ' t believe seiko can make and sell it at this price . the exact same model is offered in blue , beige , olive drab and black . watch bands are easily interchangeable . the styling is loosely based on the ww2 us army ' s & # 34 ; a - 1 & # 34 ; watch issued to soldiers and pilots alike . seiko quality at an amazing price . this would be a good ' first real watch ' choice for a young person . hope this is helpful . enjoy ! 
i got this watch for my wife and she loves it . i never expected to get a seiko automatic watch for this price ( $ 49 . 50 ) , so i jumped on it when i saw it . the canvas strap is more substantial than i expected also . all in all , it ' s a great watch . 
if you need more support , go with the regular footbed and do yourself a favor and get yourself properly fitted at a store that sells lots of birkenstocks , preferably a birkenstock store that also does repairs . a birkenstock " narrow " may fit many women ' s feet that are considered normal by any other shoe maker . a " b " width is generally considered normal for women . a b width is way too narrow for my feet . this particular pair was a bit more snug than another pair of birkenstock " regular " ( wide ) 37 soft footbeds that i own , but that may just be the difference between a wool and suede pair ? my feet have been measured recently at a 7 1 / 2 women ' s d width , but in my 20 ' s they were measured at a 6 1 / 2 women ' s ee , and e width . i wore 38 regulars for years because my feet spread and measured bigger and it recently caused all sorts of problems with my arch on the foot that is a tad smaller , my hips , knees and back . i went back to a 37 regular , with the regular footbed and the problems stopped within days . i like the soft footbed , but i cannot wear it all the time because i need more support . i ' m hoping that resoling this shoe will not be a problem , but i know that having the footbed liner replaced in a soft footbed is not done . having them resoled is less than half the cost of a new pair , even with shipping costs / travel time . for a woman with feet like mine , it ' s nice to be able to wear a decent , supportive shoe that is not horribly expensive . with " cork life " care and timely resoling , a leather pair of birkenstocks will last for years , one pair of nubuck arizonas lasted for 13 years with heavy wear . 
this is my second pair of birkenstocks in this style . i think that there is a unisex version and a women ' s " fashion " version , and this one ( black suede ) appears to be the latter . my other pair has more shape to the shoe , and the suede is thicker and less soft but sturdier . this new pair is kind of floppy and doesn ' t stay " open " when you take the shoe off . these also cost considerably less than the other pair . i still like them , they are just as comfy , but i but doubt they will last as long as the unisex version . they do run large and wide . i ordered my usual 39n and had to punch another hole in the strap to hold them on . thicker socks make them more comfy too . 
i have been plagued with foot problems for years ! in desperation , before i spent hundreds of dollars on specialists , i decided to try these shoes . after wearing them for a few days , i noticed that my feet had quit hurting . i have been wearing these shoes for two years now and i don ' t have any pain at all ! ! ( if i go barefoot for any length of time and sense that my feet are beginning to hurt , i just slip these back on and instantly i get relief ! i had to buy another pair because my original ones are looking grubby - i wear them on the beach . now i have indoor shoes and outdoor shoes . how wonderful ! 
thye most comfortable product for my troubled ffeet - i would recommend this highly - have had clogs like continuously for the last 5 years 
bought these 2 days ago , they arrived in 2 days after selecting standard shipping to canada - amazing service ! i have the arizona sandals with the regular footbed and loved them so much i wanted some clogs . but , because i will be standing in these more than walking , i decided i wanted the soft footbed . the soft footbed soles are much more plush and not entirely comparable to the regular sole . they are still supportive - that distinctive birkenstock footbed feel is there with great metatarsal and arch support - but they definitely have a lot more give to them . the leather upper is thick but soft and very comfy . the leather on the soft footbeds feels a little softer and thinner than on the regular footbeds . for those who love their birks but just want something a little more cushy , these are the answer ! for those who wanted to love birks but couldn ' t take the " hard " footbeds , this is exactly what you ' ve been looking for . i ordered the same size as my arizona sandals - i measure a size 10 . 5 medium us mens shoe on a brannock device , which according to the birkenstock chart is a 43 . but i find the 43 too large , with my toes a bit far from the end and unable to grip the toe - bar properly . so i fit a 42 regular in birkenstocks . the boston clogs fit very similar to the arizonas in terms of length and width , but the heel cup is very slightly less deep ( but still quite supportive ) , and perhaps slightly narrower than on my arizona sandals . because they have only one strap , they do fit looser on my low volume feet . i can wear them barefoot on the last notch , or on the second notch with regular socks . but since they are new , they will no doubt stretch , and i might have to cut a new notch for the buckle eventually . all in all a great piece of footwear . i am a recent and now devoted birkenstock convert after shunning them for years . finally , my feet are getting the support they need , and in a handsome and comfortable package . and at the reduced prices offered here , it ' s a no - brainer ! 
i got the boston soft footbed clog in mocha suede , in my regular size of 39 , and actually believe they are worth the money . i love these shoes . i had previously purchased my first pair of birkenstocks , the arizona ( soft ) sandal , and those took 3 weeks to break in because of the strap closest to the ankle . it hurt from the motion of walking with every step . my patience was rewarded , and those are now comfortable , but these clogs only took a week to feel like a part of my sole . ( pun intended ! ) it is not unusual for me to wear them 13 hours straight , and i prefer keeping them on to going barefoot around the house . i looked at these at a local store , and the mocha color didn ' t look like simply dark brown . it had a greenish hue , very beautiful . that was really why i chose the color . however , i ordered these online , and they do not have that special hue . they are dark brown / chocolate . the extreme comfort has made me unconcerned with the color not being what i expected . my guess at this point is that the boston style is the best birkenstock made , and i only wish that i could wear them year ' round . my feet can ' t tolerate much heat , and i don ' t think wearing suede in the rain or walking through puddles would make for a durable pair of shoes . the suede spray seems to be for stain resistance , and i don ' t think that means waterproofing . so for me , the boston is a shoe for cold and dry weather , and i don ' t wear socks with them . 
i recently got my first pair of birkenstocks with the soft footbed . previously , i only had the original footbed and broke the original in quickly , with no pain at all . i have plantar fasciitis and was excited to try the softbed out and break them in . i had actually gotten sized in a store to ensure the right fit and the softbed was highly encouraged by the salespeople . i know many people love the softbed and i don ' t know what the problem is for me . i have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are painful ( right where the plantars is ) . they are the right size . i obviously can ' t return them but i will be ordering another pair with the original footbed . the price was right for these however . by the way , i know many people dislike betula by birkenstock since they don ' t use real leather and are supposedly lower end , but i never had a problem with them . they lasted 8 years with no re - soling . i bought them by accident since i wanted a second pair of bostons and i thought they were the same . no pain at all with my plantars and quick break in period . in fact , they were exactly like the regular footbed boston birkenstock and i couldn ' t tell the difference when wearing them or my bostons . i will update my review in a few months to see if they will break in more and give me the comfort i have come to expect from birkenstock . 
i used to wear this in high school all the time and woke up one morning asking myself why i still don ' t wear them ! these are so comfortable from the moment you pull them out of the box and if you want to extend your wear of them through the winter , they feel and fit great even when you wear wool socks with them ! 
much too large and too wide . returned last week . will order again after i try them on in a store and find the right size . 
they do take some time to shape to your feet but once they do , heavenly quality shoes that will last years ! 
i have been wearing birkenstock for 22 years . i am convinced that my feet , hips , knees and back have stayed healthy because i have worn them almost exclusively for my adult life . after trying 1 pair of sandals ( that i had for several months ) and 2 pairs of clogs in the soft footbed , i have concluded that the original foot bed ( ofb ) is for me . i have small feet for my size , and very small toes . so i need supportive , comfortable shoes or i get foot pain , hip pain and knee pain . all of my arches are normal . the ofb gives complete support and comfort to all of your arches , heels , and toes because it molds to your foot . in the soft footbed has the ofb under the cushion layer , but the cushion keeps the footbed from molding to my foot . the foam layer in the sfb offers more cushion , but less structure and support , because of this i was always having foot pain with the sfb . keep in mind that the shock absorbency in birkenstocks comes from the layers of material in the ofb . you can ' t walk for miles in foam house slippers with no pain , but you can in a pair of birkenstocks . it seems like customers of the soft footbed birkenstocks have commented that there is less break in time than the original footbed . but that may be due to the fact that the cushion keeps the footbed from molding completely to your feet . i don ' t know . i only need 2 days to break in an original footbed birkenstock , and during that time i have no pain , the shoe is just a bit stiff and doesn ' t have an imprint of my foot in it . i have read that people who have fallen arches find the sfb more comfortable . to give another try the sfp this year i bought the boston clogs in olive suede and jasper suede with the soft footbed . they both were so beautiful , ( the olive suede - gorgeous ) perfect for a spring - summer - early fall wardrobe . unfortunately , they did not support my feet like my original footbed clogs , and gave me pain in my feet and knees . no heel pain though . plus , they kept falling off my feet ( part of why i think the foam in the sfb keeps them from molding to feet ) . i gave the sfb clogs to a friend of mine who has not worn birkenstock before . she absolutely loves them , wears them all the time , and says they have the most comfortable arch support she has ever had . it ' s funny , shoe needs are so specific to peoples feet . in conclusion i am all for the sfb just not for me . i think that birkenstock is only capable of making shoes that are the highest quality and alleviate foot pain for individuals who wear them . nothing beats birkenstock quality , and their leathers and colors are always very high - end . i just hope that birkenstock continues to make many different colors and soft leathers ( suede ) in the ofb . it seems like all the pretty colors come in the sfb more and more , but i hope the ofb starts to get more soon . 
the air soles and support ( i put inserts under the pad ) have ended by back pain . i purchased a second pair as a spare . 
i was skeptical , but a few friends wear these as motorcycle boots . i got a pair and got the wider width . i can honestly tell you these are far more comfortable than any other boot i own ( red wings and danner ) and seem to be holding up good as well , although i ' ve only had them for a short bit . though . . . i do wear them roughly 5 days a week and that includes riding back and forth to work and well . . . . they ' ve also become my work boots . 
really comfortable boots , fits as a glove and you can expect a good quality on swat boots , really great a purchase . 
this product speaks for itself . a classic product . . . not just for police . actually has a great tread . . . pretty water resistant and warm so makes a great winter boot and goes well with jeans . 
this set of boots was purchased for my wife and she absolutely loves it . they are extremely comfortable , noticeably lighter then the other pair of boots that she has , and she really appreciates that . she also likes the side zipper which facilitates taking off the boot . she also loves the style of them a lot which is a plus . all in all a great boot . we began breaking it in with a few walks and runs over the weekend . if my gut is correct , this pair of boots will last its fair amount of time . we will update as needed . hope this helps . 
until i found carhartt big men ' s clothes here on amazon . i had been shopping at a large big & tall men ' s chain store . the chain store items were expensive and the quality was just ok . the carhartt products feel like the same quality you would find when shopping for regular sized items , and they look great . the carhartt clothes seem to have been cut for big sizes ( as i ' ve had issues with some larger sizes fitting well . ) rather than just expanding a pattern designed for regular sizes and making it larger . so far in the past month i ' ve bought five shirts and a jacket , all of these items are 4x and fit great . the size might be a little larger than other 4x clothes , but i appreciate the little bit of extra room . the materials seem to be above average compared to the big & tall chain stores i ' ve shopped at in the past , and again the prices are much better . at the store we normally shop a shirt like this with this , with a similar type of fabric and buttons , would be closer to $ 35 - $ 40 than $ 25 . and then the quality would probably not be as good . i bought the 4x port colored shirt and love it . i ' ve been told that the way it fits looks very good , and i like the feel of the fit and material . if anyone asked me about carhartt men ' s clothes i would not hesitate to recommend them . over all a high quality product at an outstanding price ! 
this carhartt shirt offers the same great quality material and stitching as other carhartt items . i would keep an eye on the size . i would suggest you order one size larger then you normally do . 
this shirt fit great at first , but shrank a lot ( especially in length and we got a tall ) after the first wash . 
i ' ve got several of these in various colors . all of them fit very well and look and feel great . they feel like quality material that should last me quite awhile . several washings later and the colors , material and seams are all holding up very well . 
i have started to buy these carhartt shirts exclusively . they are very well made . they endure washings well . they seem to last well . they are comfy . the colors are bright and don ' t fade . i am 6 ' 4 & # 34 ; and around 220 and these xxt ' s fit me better than anything i can find in a store . robs results : finestkind ! 
i don ' t like the patch up on the chest . others have them down on the beltline . otherwise great shirt for anything . 
made very sturdy 
as with all carhartt products this is very well made . the problem is it is stiff as a board in back . you sit down and there ' s no flex . it just rides right up your neck . i tried washing mine to soften it and that didn ' t work . it ' s fine if your on your feet but when you sit down it rides right up the back of your head . 
i just bought this vest in black from a local store today . took the tags off and threw it in the wash , as i do with most new garments ( and especially carhartt stuff , which always needs breaking - in ) . when i took it out of the dryer , the inner lining had already started to disintegrate in one spot , with the insulating material showing through . i don ' t know if i got a faulty product or what , but i expect my workwear to hold up to a lot worse than a single wash . it ' s going back to the store tomorrow . this is my first disappointment from carhartt . [ edit ] i exchanged the black one for the carhartt brown one . the brown one has been great , no problems with wear and tear . hopefully the problem i had with the black one was just an isolated issue . 
pretty heavy duty - thick and warm ! wanted something a little more low profile - so i returned it ! but very nice vest ! 
i have been using the products for over 10 years : arctic bibs , coats , knit caps , jeans , double kneed work pants . they wear nicely , and i think look better the more rugged they get . i have have worn out a few pairs jeans , and double kneed worked pants . i wear them to work till they have holes , then i only wear them at home , then when they are super rugged looking i wear them to hunt , on the trapline , or to repair machines , and other dirty jobs . the one pair was so ragged , frayed , patched up , and thread bare from wear , and just plain used up i feel a sense of pride when i toss them in the rag pile , but this was after years of hard wear ! so again i say . . . it is hard go wrong buying carhartt products . i think these are positives about the vest . originally , i questioned the warmth value of the quilted lining of this vest , but after 6 weeks of temps ranging from minus 20 to minus 76 , i am extremely happy with the vest . the flexible cloth neck covering in comfortable , and is a key part of the design . it adds a tremendous amount of warmth , as it wraps around the neck area when zipped up . the other nice thing is that it is washable , unlike the filson brand wool vests , which i have one , you can wash the carhartt vest , should you get moose blood on it while hunting . i also liked the large front pockets of this vest , as i carry alot gear at work : keys , vhf , pens , markers , flash lights and what ever else i need that day . also , the pockets are deep and i don ' t worry about things falling out , which is a nice positive . this vest has become a part of my life on a daily basis . 
i ordered a s , btut it is tight and feels like an extra small and it cuts off your throat . 
it is a great product : sturdy , well - made and stylish . amazon must correct the product description . you accurately describe the vest as & # 34 ; sandstone duck & # 34 ; , but then advise that this is the carhartt v01 vest - which is not sandstone duck , but rather & # 34 ; firm hand ring spun duck - a different material . the vest you receive is the carhartt v02 vest , which is the sandstone duckl 
i got these because i get rubs when walking long distances and my boots come most of the way up my calf . these socks come up to my knees and stay there . very comfortable , no rubs . 
i wanted a good calf high pair of sock liners that could be worn under thick wool socks , or primarily ( daily ) by themselves with dress shoes . much warmer then any dress socks i have ( even the calf high pairs ) . terramar is my favorite thermal brand , and i ' m never disappointed with their products . they have two lengths , one that goes right under your calf muscle and one that goes about half way up ( what these were ) . i ' d definitely recommend them , especially if you can find them on sale somewhere . 
i did not give this a 5 star yet , i will be back to let you know if these keep my feet warm . in the winter my feet are always cold , i even wear two pairs of socks , so when it gets cold i will be back to let you know if they keep my feet warm . the socks fit good and good material , we will see if they are warm . 
would buy again due to wicking and insulation quality along with fit . they wash well and did not shrink in the dryer 
you ' ve gotta love silk - it ' s the ideal material . these are very warm and comfy socks . they don ' t cut off your circulation . 
i gave these socks to my daughter for working outside in sub - zero weather . she said her feet stayed warm . recommended for those working in cold weather . 
bought these for my honey who rides his motorcycle . . . no matter what the weather . just a extra layer for winter to keep his toes warm . and he loves them . they aren ' t to bulky to wear with a heavier pair of sock and motorcycle boots . awesome ! 
i wouldn ' t say that my feet were toasty warm because of these but i think they helped my wool socks do the job . when you are out in the cold it ' s all about layering & i believed these helped . 
wearing these under a pair of other socks worked to keep my feet warm in winter . however , after a couple of washes , the elasticity has gone . if i wear these without other socks on top , they will not stay up . i ' ll look for a different pair of thermal socks next winter . 
i love these socks . the thermasilk is warm , but thin . the socks bring any moisture to the outside and away from your feet . it is great . i have been looking for this kind of sock for years . so much better for warmth than wool socks . 
bought these for family member who was having trouble keep the feet warm . he loves them and finds them very comfortable . 
panty hose thin , seems to work well but not sure how long it will last . make sure you keep it away from velcro , it will snag and pull threads every time it gets within a foot of velcro . 
my daughter has dry skin and after wearing shin guards in the tx sun . . . . ouch . these keep the shin guards from chaffing her - so worth it ! 
nothing like silk to keep out wind and keep in warmth without moisture . these are really great . combine with silk long - johns for solid bottom half warmth . 
i was looking for a good pair of socks for my mother and found these . not too light not heavy , just perfect . as my mom says , they pamper your feet . they are perfect for light walks and every day chores . they ' re definitely a " women ' s best friend " socks . 
these socks are a good buy and all i expected of my purchase . smartwool is always worth the money as they wash and wear quickly and are comfortable indoors or outside . 
these are super comfy socks for every day : warm , hug your foot just right , don ' t fall down or slide into your boots , and don ' t make your foot sweaty . i love smartwool socks and i can tell you they stand behind their products . my husband had some smartwool socks that kept getting holes ( he ' s on his feet a lot and at first i also accused him of not keeping his toenails clipped ) - long story short , smartwool replaced them . we buy lots of smartwool products . : ) 
these socks were exactly what i wanted . not too thick to wear with shoes and very warm ! i recommend them . 
i don ' t know what it is that smartwool does . . hire rumplestiltskin to weave magical threads into their socks or something ( ! ) because smartwool socks are wonder - ful ! i loved the women ' s lightweight hiking / athletic sock so very much , but also wanted something to wear to work so i ordered a pair of the best friend crew socks . o - m - g - they are perfectly named ! these are truly my feets ' best friend . i love them ! if i could , i ' d order at least a dozen more pair ; and then another dozen to give as gifts because trust me , the recipients will thank you every time they put them on . i actually slept in them a couple of ( cold ) nights - one , because i didn ' t want to take them off , and two because they just feel so comfy that sleeping in them would be divine . and they are . all my socks will be smartwool socks from now on . 3 / 2012 : just wanted to add this note : do yourself a favor and buy more than one pair because you ' ll kick yourself that you didn ' t . i know i wish i had . i can ' t part with them long enough to throw in the wash and won ' t wear anything else ! also , i bought a pair for my daughter and my sister and they love them , too ! 
best socks i have ever owned . . . i have been wearing wool blend socks for years . . i use them year round as they keep your feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer ( by wicking away moisture ) . . . not bulky and very comfortable . . . will be purchasing more in the near future 
smartwool socks are da bomb ! ! ! i don ' t think i ' ll ever go back to any other kind for winter socks . it reached down to - 40 where i lived and a pair of these socks combined with a pair of the outdoor crew kept my feet warm and toasty for my 30 minute walk to work even when the rest of me was getting beginning stages of hypothermia ! if that ' s not a good test i don ' t know what is . they ' re not super thick and dry quickly . worn alone they are perfect for fall and spring . 
best socks ever . warm and not a bit itchy . machine washable and dryable . i tried other wool socks and came back to smartwool . 
i purchased 4 pairs for my wife , she loves them ! comfortable , and safe to put in the dryer without them shrinking . 
i got these to wear with my uniform and they were warm but a little short and lost , especially after the first wash . 
smartwool is great . these pair are thick on the bottom and dressier thin everywhere else . perfect for wearing with khakis 
feels good next to skin , doesn ' t get clammy . i have cold feet , but this pair keeps them warm 
the pants are as the top , they stretch too much after washing otherwise very good . i would go a size smaller next time . 
these thermasilk , are very light and very confortable . but i guess for the same reason they are very light they are not very warm . so even if they fit well , they don ' t really do what they have to do . they do warm you up a little , but definately no made for very cold weather . 
don ' t buy these expecting much thermal insulation , but they work great in chilly summers . i own probably 6 different types of terramar thermal ' s , and i love them all as they each have their place . these are really great for my summer hikes , when it may drop 55 - 65 . i usually don ' t bring a sleeping bag in theses temperatures , instead just a pair of these , the thermasilk shirt , and maybe a lightweight bag liner . to compare these to the terramar silkweight ( the next closest comparison in temp and weight ) : * these are 100 % pure silk . . silkweight is 100 % polyester * these are good down to 65 by themselves ( wearing shorts and maybe rain pants ) . . silkweight is good closer to 55 with the same . * these weigh 90g in medium . . silkweight weighs 140g in medium . other notes : * these are very comfortable to wear . * silk feels great against your skin . * they are rather see through when stretched out over your sikn . * they don ' t stretch as well as other terramars obviously , because its pure silk . * they seem as durable as any other terramar . i ' ve worn them out sitting on the ground by a fire , minor branch snags here and there , no rips or issues . if i had to come up with any con . . . i ' d like to see a hybrid of the silk with a little polyester or spandex . something between the weight of these and the silkweights , that offered a little stretch that fits a bit better ( or a bit more like the rest of terramars ) , and maybe offered a bit more warmth . although it ' s not really a con as much as a wish for another product . these are great warm weather thermals though , that i will continue to use for many years . 
just what i needed to go under my leather pants . the overall excellence in quality is what i ' d dreamt , but never thought it would far exceed my expectations . thank you so much for the help in completing my black leather motorcycle outfit . 
i ' ve never worn silk long johns before . very nice feel . with no pants , they feel cool . thin like fine stockings , this pant provides surprising warmth when worn under your pants . silk has great insulation , and natural wicking properties , that will provide great comfort , without uncomfortable rubbing on your skin . when you ' re watching a football game on a cold autumn day , it ' s great to have the confidence to know that you can stick it out to the bitter end . nice wide comfortable waist band . when you go inside for the victory party , they are still comfortable , because they breathe the heat away from your skin . 
man these undies are sheer . they ' re like womens panty - hose . i feel like i ' m wearing spider - webs . i can ' t see how they could ever be uncomfortable as you hardly know they ' re on . i had the idea of just hanging around the house in the evening with them on but if the light is bright enough when company drops by i ' m sure they can see all my equipment . my next step will be to buy something that will censor me better . 
gave these to my very skeptical man ( he was sure they would be uncomfortably warm indoors ) and he loves them ! we live in vermont and it ' s 5 below as i write this . he has admitted he doesn ' t know what he used to do without them ! they make a huge difference outdoors - keeping him so much more comfortable and warm - and indoors he doesn ' t even notice he has them on under his jeans . very successful gift ! 
these are very comfortable and afford me a warmth along with my regular gloves . because of the soft silk like material there is no scratching like other wool or multi - fiber insulation . i strongly recommend these for those with sensitive and dry skin . i have worn them to football games and felt very comfortable . 
this underwear is warm and comfortable but very short . i ' ve searched amazon for two months trying to find longer ones with no results . i ' m 6 ' 1 & # 34 ; and this underwear is about 6 inches to short . 
we live in very cold country and this underwear is awesome . very light . hard to imagine that it could really keep you warm but it does without all the bulkiness of heavier underwear . highly recommend . 
when we had a week of single - digit temps in virginia , i wore these under my regular work closes to and at the office . 
5 star product , 4 stars for price - to - use ratio . do not buy this as a serious outdoor thermal . this is for casual outdoor or indoor use . the silk has served my needs for my winter drives to work and cold office . the silk is comfortable and don ' t get overhot indoors or while moving around a bit . but if you want superior outdoor insulation go get some polypropelene thermals . downside is that these are not cheap , and i don ' t think they will last long because they are thin and delicate . so price to use is not great . 
as other said , they are like panty hose , probably all right for most activities , however i purchased them to use when riding my motorcycle in the cooler weather . okay but my hanes cotton ones are better for my purpose . 
everything you expect from silk underwear . just the thing for keeping warm without bulky overgarments while walking miles on winter days . 
my son loves these socks . he ' s a sneakerhead and style is very important to him . made in the usa so i will only buy wigwam . for comfort , style and fit . the best ! ! ! 
unique socks in that they are quarter length , but heavier than the others i ' ve owned . occasionally provides massaging sensation . * edit * six months later and i ' m about to order another pair of these . the same pair i bought before are still in good shape . i prefer these socks , they are very durable . i know that after a nice long run during the hot summer months that my feet will remain blister free - these socks are a big reason why , 
i am very pleased with the quality and performance of this sock . i am on my feet all day and it ' s cool and comfy . ordered 3 pairs and plan on ordering 4 more pairs . 
i bought these socks as ' unisex ' socks and my shoe size is 13 . i ' m a teacher here in japan and and get to ( have to ? ) run around most of the day in my ' sock ' feet . these socks are very comfortable , and it ' s easy to slip shoes on and off ( many times ) during the day . it ' s pretty muggy here in japan , and i have had trouble with sweating feet in the past . these socks seem to ' breathe ' enough to wick away moisture and they have enough cushion on the bottom help tired feet . it ' s my policy to never give a perfect score for anything , because everything ( even me ) can be improved . however i ' d be willing to go 4 . 5 stars on these socks . by the way they were delivered before the scheduled delivery date . i ' d have to give that a 5 . 
i work in event management and sometimes have to spend long hours on my feet in uncomfortable shoes . that ' s where these come in ! i learned a long time ago that the comfort of your socks are as important as your shoes when you ' re on your feet a lot . these midweight socks are extremely padded / thick and save you from blisters , rubbing and sore soles . make sure your shoes have room for a thick sock before ordering or else buy the lightweight version . recommended ! 
people wonder why i choose wool when hiking in the heat of the summer . wool keeps your feet dry . dry feet are happy feet . these also offer exceptional cushioning . cotton socks will get wet as you sweat and stay wet . that will cause blisters and painful , achy feet . end of hike . wool wicks the sweat away from your skin and evaporates leaving you feel much more comfortable . the wigwam brand of socks are the ones i use year round . these low cut in the summer and fall with shorts and the full length in the winter and spring for increased warmth . highly recommended . 
much looser fitting sock than i was expecting , didn ' t have the same snug fit that i am used to with trail running socks . that said i have worn them several times now and they are very comfortable with no issues although i would also have prefered a slightly thinner sock . 
great value , comfortable , high quality sock that should give me many miles of wear . these also have more decorative flair than most other wigwams . i buy socks for fit and function more than style . if you are on the fence , buy these . mid hiker - the only thing you might not like is that they are higher than ankle socks and lower than crew socks . personally , i like the extra height for active wear . 
i wear these socks to work and a slowly having them replace my old cotton socks . they ' re comfortable , but provide cushioning and keep my feet dry ! 
i like these . nice and thick , fit good , look good and the price is not to bad . seems to last good also . 
these socls are bvery plush and fit the foot like a glove . try it for yourself you will be very happy . shipping was quick and painless . 
i like the socks very much . they make my feet feel better during and following hikes . for hiking , good socks are at least as important as good shoes . 
i got these for my son based on the reviews written by men who have worn and switched to also wear them with their dress shoes for work . i am ordering more because these are what he loves to be in ! ! so hopefully they hold up for a few years like i have read . 
i hate the socks that have no ankle to them . i also don ' t want long dorky socks i have to roll down ( like flashdance leg warmers ) . these are amazingly comfortable , well made , perfect length , and in fact , i ' m buying more ! you get what you pay for and these are great . 
these fell apart after 2 washings . are you kidding me putting this up for sale ? don ' t buy , look elseware , forget about it . these are cheap at best . 
i got these for my hubby , he wears them under his street clothes . he loves them , this is the second set . 
helped during 40 below wind chill iowa winter weather . washed well and handy to have for cold weather seems durable 
i purchase lands end last year and they are a lot thicker . they might work to keep you warm on a fifty degree day but any colder you are going to have to double or triple them up . 
very nice . kinda like long johns without the bulk . not super warm but a big help in cold weather , worth it . 
these are nice sox . they are kind of heavy duty but not so thick your shoes don ' t fit right . they seem to be good quality , i have washed and dryed them , the next test will be my 18 - year old teen son with size 13 feet ! 
these socks are not the same as the original ones that i bought 5 years ago . they feel softer and maybe a little thinner than the original . i think the softer feel will in the long run win out out over the slightly thinner . i hope these last as long as the one i bought 5 years ago . 
it is not super , but they are not thin like some people claim . normally i review the reviews in coming to a decision . little did i think that the definition of the sock would be the issue . when i think of " crew " socks , short , ribbed socks come to mind . now while i don ' t have long legs , only a 32 inseam , i still did not think these things would come all the way up to an inch below my knee when pulled completely up . i just wanted a sock i could wear trail gaiters with . while they fit my feet , i wear a 12 . 5 running shoe and bought the 12 - 14 size . . . the length of the upper is hard to hide . now , if you want that pete maravich look , dating myself , these are for you . i do have to agree that when champion goes to mass produce a product for the big box stores the quality can slip . oh well . . . most people seem to love them . . . but to me . . . the visible pills and knitting errors on brand new socks means pretty crappy quality control . i guess it is hit or miss . 
be careful , though . as with most white socks i ordered size 12 to fit my size 10 . worked like a charm . otherwise these socks are just fine . a little bit longer than shown and they are thick , so you may need shoes one - half size bigger . 
the best of all champion socks that we have ever purchased . soft and plush . thick . i really enjoy folding these socks for my husband . 
this the second package of these socks i received . please note the size . first order i called and told amazon i got the wrong size . the second order came and they are also the wrong size . i did not call the second time because it is not worth the hassle . i figured out that i would keep getting the wrong ones . what they are sending is shoe size 6 - 12 which is a sock size 10 - 13 . i was ordering these for myself , but they ended up going in my husband ' s sock drawer . at the same time i ordered him a package of white ones in the larger size . they were the correct size . what i think happened is the packages are mismarked , listing shoe instead of sock size . that would be fine if you could tell before you order . still love the socks , they are so soft and cushiony , just wish i could get in my size . 
these are nicely cushioned , although not as cushioned as one champion sport sock that seems to be unavailable now . still , a good all around sock for cooler weather , using as quasi - slippers around the house , and with shoes that are not already a border - line tight fit . i ' d guess the cushioning is possibly 5 - 6 times what you get in so called cushioned dress socks - but these could pass in their place . it ' s a reasonable price for a good product . 
really comfy ! ! yet another great deal from amazon - i had been squashed into size ten for years - and now my pups can breathe ! ! the circulation feels better , too ! 
love how these socks have stretchy woven elastic arcoss the top . they are very comfortable . i was very happy to find them . fast service and great price ! : ) 
when champion used to make socks for costco ( " elite " ) they were the best , most comfortable socks i had ever owned . they made my feet so comfortable i ' m sure i could have worn my boots to bed . but costco switched to a sock made by somebody else , and champion dropped the " elite " line . the ones i just bought ( just like another reviewer said ) are thin . too thin . they might be o . k . for a tennis shoe , but never for a work boot . i did get excellent customer service from champion , and they even sent me a check for 10 bucks as a sort of refund . by the way , the kirkland sock from costco is terrible , but that ' s another story . 
champion makes really good clothing . after two years , the elastic bands still keep the socks from creeping down to your ankles . the material is extremely comfortable ! 
i have purchased champion brand socks in bricks - and - mortar stores , and they have been rather thin or skimpy , and they are always too tight because of the all too common tendency to save money ( for the manufacturer , not necessarily the consumer ) by having one size supposedly fit all ( or nearly so ) . most store - bought socks seem to be & # 34 ; for sizes 6 - 12 & # 34 ; , which means way too tight like a tourniquet if you have a large foot size and probably too loose if you have a small foot , duh . these ( champion from amazon ) have a series of sizes , and while each size covers a range of foot sizes , they are much more realistic , smaller ranges , so they fit better . in addition , these are thicker , taller , and generally higher quality than the ones i ' ve seen in the stores from champion . i wonder if champion ' s marketing folks realize that every pair they sell in stores makes consumers think of champion as cheap and ill - fitting ? hmmm . but these are very good , and less expensive than the also good but overpriced socks from some other , specialty sock brands . 
i purchased these to fill out my athletic sock drawer and was very pleased with the weight , value , and quality of this sock . 
i bought this sweatshirt from the merchant the deal rack . the shipping was so fast that i was caught off guard when it arrived . it was almost like i bought it in the store and had it home the same day . they deserve credit for their fast as lightning shipping . as far as the quality of the sweatshirt , you cant go wrong with this item . i have bought a few in the past both in oxford grey and black for work . they hold up really really well and fit perfectly . every time ! thats why i came back looking for more . and i am grateful that they still make this style and its available . if your looking for a warm easy to wear long lasting sweatshirt , you cant go wrong with this style . . . . . . . . and the merchant either ! 
these are the regular thick champions we all grew up wearing . they ' re incredibly durable for cotton - wear like iron . and , very nice for this price i think . i would buy again . 
good sweatshirt . after reading the review , i ordered an 2xl . glad i did . after 1 wash it fits well ( ido like a slightly baggy shirt , though , and have 47 & # 34 ; chest , 37 & # 34 ; arms ) . i like the rough cotton feel and wear of the 90 / 10 cotton fabric . 
i like champion products , but while checking out the dark green sweatshirt , i noticed the price doubled for the large size . all other sizes are around $ 20 , but the large is almost $ 45 ! ! if you just pick green and large size , w / out checking , you will find yourself paying dbl what this shirt should cost . maybe everyone else is good at catching details , i ' m not . 
let me be clear ; i ' m a 2m guy , having no problems to wear american xl sizes . own a champion 1780 xl sweat ash and 3 other colors xl ' s too , i like and use ash so much that i ordered one more , at under moments . to order only one more was the only luck at this purchase . got a clear oversized like - item as i compared the size and the ( at this item ) very weak unelastic head opening . this is like a sloppy copy , additional the weak fit on the shoulders is not usable or look acceptable and cuffs are to turn out . to control if the manufacturer had made a hidden upsizing i ordered from another seller deal rack a same style l size sweat and did ' nt got my accustomated xl cause i got an accurate l size which i can ' t wear like this oversized too . for living in germany return is impossible i avoid the first mentioned seller furthermore . 
i bought this type of shirt 13 years ago from the same company and have just worn it out . while this is not exactly the same is very good so far . . . time will tell 
if you are looking for a typical sweat pant this is it . nice and thick with a fleece lining , super comfy and warm . 
these sweatpants were not exactly what i was looking for , but i am not displeased with them either . they are lighter than i thought & i like a thicker elastic band . overall , i am happy with them though 
i purchased these navy sweatpants quite some time ago . and i really like them and am very happy with them . 
these sweats are real . nice and thick and comfy and cotton ! the pockets are deep and usable . the drawstring is a nice feature for perfect fit . 
i bought these champion cotton sweatpants for my husband . he is very happy with them . he wears a size l and that ' s what i bought from amazon . they fit well and washed very well . minimal shrinkage . pants are always a little long on him so if there was length shrinkage it would be a good thing but there was not dramatic change . it took me some time scrolling through amazon to find cotton sweats with pockets and these are just what i was looking for . very happy with price and amazon service . 
pants are way too long also - way too largedraw string white - not as pictured . seem like it will stretch or beak easy ! i buy jerzees hoodies all the time . had to use a box - & had to pay return shipping ! 
my husband really likes these sweatpants , there are heavier weight and fit just right . the length is a little bit long but they are just sweats , and comfort is everything . 
i ' m a woman who loves to wear men ' s sweats around the house . they are just more comfortable and not confining like so many of my & # 34 ; woman & # 34 ; clothes . this is the first pair of champion sweats . . . lightweight and heavy weight that have been cut so narrowly through the hip / rear area . i love sweatpants with the elastic bottom . . . nice and warm in the winter . they have become very hard to find . 
they have thin pockets , so one can actually leave the house with them , although one should carefully consider the wisdom of doing so . ; ) they are thick and well made , and have elastic at the cuffs so that having the perfect length is not critical . the ones nowadays that are so popular with the young kids , with the open bottoms , are always dragging on the ground , and i can ' t see them lasting long . the elastic in the waist band is wide , so it doesn ' t dig into the ol ' love handles . quality is up to snuff , and that is the main thing i was looking for . i ' ll probably get another pair of these , as i will want to have them when the other pair is in the wash . i hope they don ' t get all cheap and ruin them with cost - cutting . oh , one thing : they ' re not really ( polar ) fleece . they ' re just regular sweat pants , but thick . i think they say ' fleece ' just because they ' re soft on the inside . 
nice sweats , a little large . i am a medium and bought one , fits more like a large but not unmanageable . it is nice and thick . 
i bought the same brand 13 years ago and just wore them out . this seems to be fine so far . . but time will tell 
great pants just one complaint the pockets are waaaaaaay to small cant even fit my wallet in them it sticks out 
these shorts appear to be a good quality and were delivered in a short time . i needed the largest they had for my son and these appear to fit the bill . however , these types of shorts sell for 6 or 7 bucks in walmart , they just don ' t carry the size i needed for my son . 
i had purchased other shorts from this supplier and they were great , fit very comfortable with deep pockets . later i went topurchase more shorts since i liked them . i ordered 5 more pair of shorts from the same supplier from the same size . when ireceived the new order i took them out of the packages and put them in my drawer . the following day i put a pair on and tomy disappointment they were tight and could hardly get my hands in the pockets . 
nice and cool and fit well only down fall is that they can smag on stuff really easy ! ! love them 
this is a good set of shorts , and if i liked them they would get 5 stars . i just like the cotton ones better , personal preference . if you need good pair of shorts with pockets to get sweaty in , or in my case be lazy in , these are a solid product . i just like the cotton ones best . 
the shorts fit my husband just great . they have a comfortable fit for him , ( even though he says he needs a smaller size ) . they fit him just right . and what ' s really great is the price . we will be ordering more of these shorts . 
i not agree that this product is for big and tall guys . how often you see tall guys with these measurements ? never . this is not for tall , excuse my language , but for people who have to start thinking about some exercises . 
i ordered 2 pair of these shorts 1 red 1 blue i ordered both in 4x so they would be a little baggy the red ones are fine the blue ones must be labeled wrong because they are at least a 5x if not 6x too bad i waited a while before wearing the blue now its to late to return but all in all they are nice comfortable shorts 
when i ordered these shorts , i decided to go with charcoal , since i have about a million workout shorts in black . i didn ' t order these to work out in ( adidas shorts work best for me personally for that purpose ) . rather , i bought these to sleep in and for when i am lounging around the house . i knew i wouldn ' t use them to work out in because they are long . they have a roomy fit . i have put on some pounds lately since my schedule has precluded me from going to the gym as i have been traveling out of town for work about half the time and also not eating very well on the road and my regular shorts had gotten a bit snug . i bought these to tide me over till i lose the lbs i have put on recently . the fit is fairly generous , and i probably should have gone a size smaller , as i have to tie the drawstrings tight just to keep them on . that is no big deal , if i had the time i would have just gone into a store and tried a pair on , but i didn ' t , so i just took my best guess as to what size i needed . having a generous fit , when you are just going to be sleeping in the shorts or maybe lounging around in them before bed , isn ' t a big deal and is certainly better than them being too small . however , my disappointment is with the color . they look more like a dark hunter green to me than charcoal . i have several charcoal suits , pants , socks , etc as it is a great color on men in a business setting . formal yet without being dour , in my opinion . however these shorts don ' t look like any of the other charcoal clothes i own . in fact if i was going to be wearing them to the gym i would return them . i honestly , thought it was a mistake and that i had been sent a green pair of shorts when i first opened the package , but the packing slip said charcoal and they don ' t even carry a green , so this must be their charcoal . if you are on the fence , go with black , much safer color , and i am sure more true . how can you mess up black ? just an fyi . also , the shorts are long . price was a determining factor for me , since i will be the only one seeing these , and for the money , these seemed to be the best deal here . however , they are very long . of course you know that since they say they are 22 inches . however , i am 5 ' 8 ' and these come well past my knees , almost mid shin . as a grown man , i would be embarrassed to wear them out even to run to the grocery store , as their length on a guy who is average height is a little bit comical . 
i ' ll be sending these back . when you describe shorts and say 22 & # 34 ; , that should describe the inseam . not the length from the waist . 
this shirt is perfectly sized , i ' ve even washed it a couple of times to check for shrink , not happening . i got the tall size and i must say it performs as advertised . if you need a shirt to go golfing or just for a jog , this is your shirt , nice and dry , sweat just wicks away . 
the black and the white in this shirt really pop . it looks awesome . i have the blue one and also the gray one as well , but the black is the nicest of the three . if you only buy one , get the black one , but the others are nice as well . 
i like the style and the airflow is just right . better than some other athletic mesh type shirts i ' ve tried . 
these are great quality and are great for casual dress . great price too ! ! they do not shrink at all , so make sure you buy the right size , no need to allow for shrinkage . 
i have only worn it once to play golf on a very hot day . it was comfortable and much cooler than a cotton shirt . the size is as expected , if not a little generous . we ' ll see how it holds up over time but so far i like it . 
awesome shirt , lightweight feels great and looks really good with the different color piping down the side . will be ordering more in in quite a few different colors . 
i ' m a 3xlt and this shirt fits me exactly the way i like it . it ' s comfortable , cool , and dries quickly after playing golf in the south florida heat . great material that doesn ' t snag as easily as other climate controlled golf shirts i own . 
these boots are so comfortable . i can wear them with skirts , dresses or pants . i have skinny calves and these fit perfectly . 
this is a nice confortable boot if you are looking for something causual . if was looking for a dress boot i returned them . 
i love these boots ! they are very comfortable and fit like a glove . my only complaint is that they keep turning my toes black . either my socks or through my hose to my toes . i assume it ' s because they ' re new , i sweat a lot and it will eventually go away . however , that would not stop me from buying another pair . 
i love love love these boots . i love them so much that when my old pair war out i was afraid i wouldn ' t be able to find a replacement . i was completely thrilled when i found the exact same item on amazon . 
i wanted a mid - heeled boot that fit close to my thin legs when i wore skirts . this one served that purpose . it ' s very conservative which means it can serve as wardrobe staple and be there when you need a casual comfortable boot . 
i ' ve been looking for a pair of black boots for a while and i ' m glad i got these . the heel height ( 2 . 5 inches ) is high enough for me . i ' ve been wearing these in winter temperatures with socks and my feet have actually been warm ( the ling is thin however ) . the rubber sole adds to the comfort . point to note : i have slim calves and would have liked the opening to be a little smaller , if worn with jeans it ' s not as noticeably large . 
i wasn ' t willing to pay a lot for boots that i will wear with only a few outfits , so these fulfilled my expectations perfectly . i think people will be left guessing as to whether or not these boots are made of leather . the style is restrained , but stylish in its simplicity . the boots fit my foot and calf perfectly , and i like the low heel because i can wear these for hours without discomfort . 
i usually would only buy leather boots . but i ' ll have say these didn ' t disappoint . it was a great price and they look even better . you won ' t go wrong with these . 
i was hesitant to order these boots because i dont like my legs being constricted , but these are awesome ! they are the perfect size and are comfortable enough to wear to work all day ( i work in an office ) . these boots were a little uncomfortable at first , but after a few days , they are great . they look good with jeans or dresses ! 
i have a much more high end pair of boots , but this pair can ' t be beat for comfort . this is a good pair to bring when you travel - - they even hold up well through long airport walks . fits my legs perfectly - - they have big expansion gussets to accommodate most women ' s legs and stay comfortable on long airplane rides . your legs will sigh with releief when you put these on . also , they are very attractive and husbands like them , if my husband is any guide . : ) 
pros - - attractive from a distance - - affordable - - toe bed is comfortable - - side zippers can take some abuse - - they stretch to accomodate a wide width calfcons - - seriously cheap - looking up close . the pleather looks cheap . no way around it . - - construction is spotty . these are a few seasons old and the glue that holds the shoe together seems to be going in some shoes . i had to order two pairs and i sent one back . - - these boots hurt my knees and heels after a few days . i can only wear them one day a week . having said all this , i have not thrown these boots away because i can ' t find anything better in this price range . i wish i could throw them out . 
these boots are great ! they fit true to size and i haven ' t noticed any pinching or rubbing that could cause discomfort in time . the one thing i have noticed is they are fairly snug across the top of my feet , nothing that would deter me from wearing them and they have stretched a little as they have been worn . they are also surprisingly water resistant . the first day i wore them we had a big dump of snow and i was a little worried about how they would hold up as i trucked through a foot of snow . but i had no issues , the rubber soles had decent grip and my feet stayed dry . my calves measure 13 1 / 4 & # 34 ; and the boots fit very snug which is great for bare legs or thin leggings , but i ' m not sure how well they will fit over top of jeans or other thicker pants . the heel is a perfect height and i can easily wear these to work with dress pants , a skirt or dressed down with a pair of jeans . i would definitely buy these again . 
they fit snugly along the leg , and i have thin legs . if you have muscular calves you may have an issue , but the material is stretchy . the soles are comfortable , and i can walk in them all day no issues . good support . 
i am 5 ' 7 " and 135 lbs . i have thin legs and i have never found a pair of boots that actually fit my calves without tons of loose fabric everywhere , until these ! plus they have a really nice height heel and are comfortable to walk in . love aerosoles and the price is right , too ! 
this is my 6th pair of these mules + i love this pair as much as i love my 1st pair . so many colors & several different textures keep me coming back for more . that & the fact that they come in half and wide sizes . ridiculously low priced for a really great looking mule with all day comfort + they ' re super durable . they are the perfect pant shoe . just slip them on & go ! highly recommend ! ! ! 
very comfortable and elegant for " comfy shoe " . i wear them to work and get many compliments . true to size . 3 / 16 / 2009 update - - - - - - - still very comfortable , but the leather strechted a bit and they don ' t look so nice as when i initially got them . the leather is very soft and conformed to the shape of my feet . as a result , the shoes lost their shape . 
pros * i can put these shoes on brand new and wear them all day with discomfort . * they look smart . cons * the first two times i bought this shoe they lasted many months . the last two lasted a few months , and less than a month , respectively ( in both cases the bottom of the heel fell off ) . i got a full refund but will not buy this style again . the salesperson in the aerosoles store said that when the heels fall off her shoes she just glues them back on again . that is hardly an endorsement of the product . in any case my heel fell off and was lost before i noticed . maybe they should attach them a bit more securely ? 
i was hesitant to purchase , because i loved my old ones so much , & it took me years to find something just as good . , but these are great shoes ! from a far , when wearing jeans , people think i ' m wearing boots ! 
the shoes are very stylish , and fit perfectly ! i ordered 7w . they look like medium size , and very comfortable . like it ! 
they have become my favorite shoes . they are comfortable , sturdy and look good with jeans or dress slacks . i got them in wide so i can wear thick socks in the winter . i now have them in four different colors . 
i have had two pairs of this style prior . one brown suede , which i wore out after 5 or 6 years , then black leather . i was so glad to see these in red . but , the upper is made of some plastic - y stuff that is stiff & makes my feet sweat . i have had such a hard time finding red casual shoes , i ' m torn whether to return them or not . but if i had known the quality has taken such a nosedive , i wouldn ' t have bought them in the first place . 
it arrived in perfect condition , very quickly . it looks even nicer in person than in the pictures . i got the black suede . it runs true to size , and the zipper doesn ' t cause any discomfort . i sometimes have issues with boot zippers if i don ' t have a knee - length sock underneath protecting my skin , but these don ' t cause any irritation . no blisters or rough spots , no break - in period needed , and very comfortable , even with a lot of walking . great boots ! 
i bought these boots loving the fact that they are faux suede and had a wedge heel , and hoped they would be as great as others i have in my closet . instead , they did not fit right anywhere . the instep was wayyyy off kilter for my feet and actually hurt , the size was obviously wrong , and the wedge was just plain weird . i prefer boots that fit me right instead of boots that surely do not fit at all . sadly , i am returning these boots and can just hope the next ones fit properly . 
this is a nice boot . i ordered it as a gift , but ordered the wrong width and it has been returned and ordered the correct size . 
love these boots ! wore them the day they arrived at my house all day long . literally - from 11am to 11pm and totally comfortable , no breaking - in needed . i bought the black ones and they look great with black skinny jeans , gives me a longer , leaner line which i need . i have narrow feet and these fit perfectly . 
i have these boots in black ( with a slightly smaller heel ) . i work 10 + hours on concrete and the a insole i can comfortably wear both pairs all day long . i would love to have them in red . 
so not as comfortable as its supposed to be ! ! for aerosoles i am definitely disappointed , was expecting a super comfy boot ! ! 
i received the boots and tried them on . they were comfortable in the feet , but unfortunately i have very muscular calves , and was not able to zip it up all the way . 
this boots are beautiful , comfortable and very stylish ! they are so good that i bought another one as a gift to a friend ! 
these watches are just hard to set ; moisture will make them even more so . to top it off you also misplace the instructions to resent when the time changes . as a result , i bought one for regular time and one for daylight savings time . it is easier to find a watch than the instructions ; and i don ' t have to worry about the little buttons sticking due to moisture over the years . the batter is supposed to last for 10 years . the price could not be more reasonable . you don ' t need a magnifying glass to read the time , day and date . 
this watch is very good except for the strap which could have been better . it has a good big dial and the back light is really good . the big dial is best suited for men . it has dual time mode for checking two different timezones however that take about 3 presses of the buttons before you can see the other timezone . it is easy to change date values . the only qualm i have with this watch is that it ' s strap is a little poky on the edges . a little better strap could make is a really good watch . comparison with a158 series watch - i like the a158 series watch a little better than this , i own both . the a158 series watch strap is a lot of comfortable and has a brushed finish to it . however the a158 watch dial is smaller and may look unisex . if you don ' t want the unisex look for a158 watch and wouldn ' t mind replacing this strap with a more comfortable one . this is the best vintage digital looking watch out there . it is worth the money . 
a nice well made and well thought out wristwatch for the money . well featured , easy to understand manual walks you through setting this watch up to best suit you . 
i am really pleased with this purchase , especially since the watch was basically free . i ' m not sure how they can design , construct and ship this watch for $ 13 . 99 . it ' s an excellent value . but it ' s not just a really low - end option , the watch actually performs well and looks nice . is it some exotic swiss chronometer that will turn heads on the red carpet ? no . but it does have the necessities that most " work watches " need , including : time with day and date , second time zone , 1 / 100 chrono and multi alarm . and these basic features are housed in a durable stainless case with a comfortable stainless band . again , i ' m impressed with the overall quality given the super low price . my only complaint , or wish , is that it also had a countdown timer . but that ' s not a huge deal . overall , i highly recommend this watch . i wear it daily , even though i have several multi - thousand dollar watches . this simple casio is my go - to timepiece . 
perfect in every way . why pay more and not get the same results . i find it does all that i asked for and i wear it everyday . has not lost any time . 
purchased this watch to replace two broken resin case wrist watches that broke with a few weeks of light use . took a bit of time to learn how to use the clasp on the watch band ( last stainless steel band watch was purchased in early 1970 ' s and had different type of fastening feature - - subsequent watches had buckle ) . have very small wrist and the band adjustment is convenient . 
my husband has had a similar casio with the rubberized band for years but the band kept getting caught on things so he asked for a bracelet style . this watch serves its purpose beautifully . he uses the stopwatch feature all of the time . the bracelet band is very easy to adjust and he loves that the date and day of the week and date are so prominently displayed . if you ' re looking for a digital watch that is comfortable and durable , look no further . 
i purchased this watch because my prior experience with casio has been excellent . casio makes a dependable , accurate , inexpensive watch . i find this particular watch quite attractive and though lightweight , i like the metal band . i have a perfectly good casio watch almost the same as this one , but what good does it do to have a watch with a cheap resin band that will fail within a year with a ten year battery ; and with a replacement watch band that costs more than a new watch . i expect excellent use from this watch at a very low cost . 
it ' s a casio , so it should hold up well ( til the battery goes out , then sometimes it is almost cheaper to buy another one ) . this one is somewhat different in appearance than my others ; yes it is a chrome silver with a cheap wristband , and , yes , the buttons are in the same place as all the other casios i have purchased ( they usually last me a couple of years ) ; the difference is in the more rectangular appearance of the face of the unit . my other units are somewhat more square ( but rounded of course ) , and to me they are slightly more attractive . other than the slight aesthetic differences this watch appears to have the same & # 34 ; guts & # 34 ; as my others . it is relatively easy to set the watch to the right time , to use the timer , and to set the alarm should you so choose ( same as all the others ) . it is a good watch for the money . 
i was so fed up with my previous watch , whose wristband kept breaking and cost more to replace than this entire watch does ! what did i lose ? many features i don ' t use , such as the time in sydney , tokyo and moscow , plus a few more gimmicks i never used . what did i gain ? a great watch , well made , and a user - friendly interface . 
well , not a secret maybe but i felt like i was solving a mystery . the little instruction booklet is too small for me to read , but i figured out the basics . . . to set the time , etc : push top left button until the seconds flash . . . push bottom left button to choose the function / mode . . . push bottom right button to cycle through the numbers ( or days ) to adjust the band : dvd3 saved the day for me . . . dvd3 says : with the the clasp unhooked and the watch facing upwards , take a small conventional screwdriver ( i used a paperclip ) and insert it into the slot on the female half of the clasp and gently pry the clip upwards by pressing down on the handle of the screwdriver . it should now be loose . now slide the clasp up or down the strap until it is the size you want it . snap the clasp back into place ( you might have to move it slightly to get it into exactly the right position ) by pressing down on the clip firmly . test it and if it is still wrong , repeat until it ' s the size you want it . you just replied with a later post 
very expensive looking watch but only $ 14 . 00 . i am keeping this watch for good . my old watch i am keeping for work . 
this watch keeps great time . i had one exactly like it and the price is so good that when my old one needed a watch battery and it was scratched up i bought this exact same one and got rid of the old one . and that one was 6 years old . 
this is good lloking watch and nice price . this is just very nice gift all my relative in thailand so i bought it for them . 
not the trendiest or most fashionable watch . . . but they are cheap and last a long time . buy one of these before putting a battery in an old watch . my dad has used these for years . surprised to find them ! 
this is a nice watch with this band voguestrap tx51012bk allstrap 16 - 20mm i dont like metal bands they are not very comfortable the light works best in total darkness doesnt work well in low light 
bought this for my dad for his birthday . he likes that it has large numbers he can see easily , along with having the day and date . it is a simple straight forward watch . 
this watch has a clear display , easy to navigate functions , easy to operate stop watch . light and comfortable on wrist . 
i bought this because i am rough on my watches . this is cheap and i figured if i got a year out of it it was worth the price i paid . the band is very cheap everything scratches . pay a little more and get a casio pathfinder fish or hunting model they take all you can throw at them . ( usually about $ 30 . on amazon ) 
a very nice and nice looking watch . the only complaint is that the band is hard to adjust ( look at other reviews to learn how ) and the led is hard to read when hands are in front of it . also , the lighting doesn ' t work all that well ; it is very dim and you can tell the time , but just barely . if you like the look of an analog watch with the functions of a digital , this is a good choice . 
lo compre para mi hijo y le gusta aunque aun no ha aprendido a controlarlo porque ea muy flojo y no le gusta leer las instrucciones 
its not too heavy , and it doesn ' t look cheap like the newer square model . only problem is the i have a small wrist and the band is pretty stiff . 
excellent watch very tough and durable , with many functions , very elegant and practical , i really like , is very beautiful and is excellent for use in all occasions 
if the face were as easy to read as the photo , maybe i would have given this a 4 or 5 . just a tad hard to read even in bright light . the face is not white , it ' s silver , like the hands themselves , making it difficult to glance and & # 34 ; see & # 34 ; the time . but with lcd back up and display easy enough to use . however , the light ( s ) are absolutely worthless and you can not read anything in darkness . very disappointing , otherwise a very decent watch . 
i am a fan of casio watches . i was fascinated by this watch with lot of technical features , including world time setting , stop watch and nice analogue display apart from digital display . . above all , it has 10 year battery . . . it is water resistant too and has alarm setting . how did casio engineers do all this ? ! well , it is a japanese design . it was easy to set the time with the instruction booklet , though the booklet letter size is very small , tiring my eyes . a nice buy and i strongly recommend for all tech - savvy users , though non - technical persons may be put off by too many features and buttons . the price is just right , for a watch with japan quartz movement , cased in china as the writing at the back tells . i hope this watch serves me for several years as the old casio one i used did for nearly 10 years . ! 
this watch is so rugged that i will buy it twice . i wll not hesitate to buy it as a gift for any one even my young son . 
i wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review . i have worn this watch daily and use the alarm to remind me to take medication . it ' s a great watch . takes a couple of minutes to read the manual and learn to use the alarm and stop watch features , but it is much more straightforward than other chronographs i have owned . the velcro band is comfortable and light weight and works fine . it is attached with watch pins to the watch so it doesn ' t add extra bulk to the watch as do bands that cover the whole wrist . the band is much more comfortable than i thought it would be . i wear the watch for all my daily activities including gardening and it ' s comfortable , accurate and light weight , easy to read , and looks good . it ' s a great watch . 
this watch has more functions than i need , which can only be a plus . it looks nice , keeps acurate time . i like the band and the digital / analog display . if the battery last half as long as promised this well be an excellent purchase . 
digital , non - sports watches are getting harder to find . here ' s one i had hoped would be easier to fit and use . ginormous band causes problems - why not a more traditional cloth and leather velcro band ? ? ? ? nice size and controls are sleek and don ' t stand out from body . digital area does get blocked by analog hands - most difficult when trying to read the date ! 
looking for a work watch this is it . seems to hold up ok and it keep ' s time that all it has to do and so far work ' s great 
this watch as inexpensive as it is , works & looks great . the little manual is written in a clear and concise manner and is easy to follow . after setting it to an atomic time clock , it ' s still accurate a month later . of course i have 9 years & 11 month before i can critique the battery . x 
i bought this watch but not at k - mart , i like it very much , it has the quality of a $ 100 watch , i ' ll match it up with one and this casio can compare to it for 2 / 3 off that price ! if you have very large wrists this is the watch for you as the band is very long . one thing i would like to say is that the photo does not do this watch justice , in the photo it looks plain ugly but when you get it in person you ' ll feel much better about it . it ' s a great deal for the price and the quality is something to admire as well . the 10 year battery can ' t be beat not to mention it being 10bar . casio makes great inexpensive watches and i ' ve had one ever since i was a kid , i hope they keep up the great work into the future . dial is extremely easy to read i ' ve had watches in the past that cost $ 200 that wren ' t as clear to read as this one ! i don ' t know how casio does it but they do , much much better than their competitors which i need not name . 
this is a nice dress watch at a reasonable price . the band has a nice catch that is secure and easy to release . it caught a few hairs , and isn ' t as adjustable for length as some other casios , but it fits me . the watch is relatively thin , and i think it is attractive . the face is navy blue instead of black - a feature that sets it off in my small collection of watches . the date has been moved from 3 : 00 down to about 4 : 30 - this seems to work just as well for me . this watch doesn ' t have a lot of fancy features - it looks nice and tells the time - that is all i was looking for . 
my father with 91 years old is happy with this watch is big number and simple function thanks a lot . 
very attractive watch . basic features but that ' s about all you ' d want in a dress watch . face is dark blue . easy to adjust the date , but adjusting the watchband length was not particularly easy , even having worked on my other 5 casio metal banded watches . youtube videos were some help but the link locks were just difficult to remove for some reason . still 5 stars because it is a very nice looking watch . 10 year battery ought to have it running down about the time i decide to buy another . 
classy looking watch . so far , it ' s keeping perfect time . the hands don ' t stay illuminated very long in the dark , but that ' s not an issue with me . can ' t beat the price too . 
casio is very popular brand . and i know that dad would love this watch . when i gave it to him i can see that he really like it . thank you so much amazon . 
got this as a gift for my husband . looks well made and is a nice all around watch . haven ' t had it long enough to see how long the battery lasts . for the price it is a good looking and functional watch . 
i bought this watch for a gift , the person was very glad to have it , the only cons : the band is not adjustable , so be careful , there is no way to adjust the band . 
not as good as i thought it would be , it was expensive but had none of the options that i thought were advertized . 
i bought this to replace my husband ' s old watch . he loves it and has told me repeatedly that he thinks it ' s the best watch he ' s ever owned ( including the really expensive one his ex bought him ) . the illumination is good , the size is good , he likes the color and the contrast . we are very pleased with this product . 
i ' ve only had this watch for about a week now but so far , it is keeping perfect time . there are a couple of minor issues with the watch but nothing that i found to be dealer breakers . first , the watch band is difficult to adjust ( remove links ) . i gave up and went to a jewelry repair shop and had them do it . second , the date box ( displayed between the 4 & 5 o ' clock hours ) is small and my eyesight isn ' t what it used to be so unless i have near perfect lighting condiction , i am unable to read it . not a big deal since i usually know the date anyway . third , the watch band will pull arm / wrist hair . i overcame this by simply shaving the small area where i wear the watch . it isn ' t overly obvious so i ' m okay with it . other than that , i like the watch a lot ! 
its a nice watch with nice finish and color . i particularly like the blue face and gold tones around the band . 
outstanding build quality and beauty . looks more expensive than the price that was paid . a very good alternative to those folks who cannot afford or let alone wear larger watches like invicta etc . although i do have a few of my own and really like them also . most difficult part was adjusting and resizing the watch band . casio build quality is so precise that it takes a lot of skill to remove the metal pins and remove 4 links . otherwise , took me 1 / 2 hour to resize the band since i have my own watchmaking tools i also purchased from amazon . back case cover is a screw on type which is preferable since it really keeps out moisture and is much easier to remove when replacing batteries although i think it will be about ten years before i would even consider doing so . my last casio edifice purchased in las vegas was purchased when my son was five years old . he just made 15 when the battery finally died and had to be replaced . it just doesn ' t get any better . buy it . you won ' t regret this purchase since it is so elegantly styled and built like a tank . highly recommended . 
i put the appropriate rate , because the watch was too small , looked like toy or a baby . the brand is very good and comes with warranty and case or own support . recommend but first read well the size 
can ' t beat a classic . starting a new generation on the watch i had forever . nicely sized for a pre - teen . hasn ' t been in use long , so cannot confirm if durability is the same as it used to be . 
my dad has worn these watches for years . he is a contractor and very rough on things . they last him a long time and are well worth the money . he continues to buy them . i bought this for my husband to wear to work underground . 
i knew this watch was small before i even placed the order . when i received it , i regretted it a little and was almost embarrassed to wear it . but after wearing it around for a few hours i started admiring the lightness . i almost forgot i had it on . i started wearing this watch daily . i wear this watch when i work out or when im working in the shop ( construction and fabricating ) . the best part is that its actually pretty rugged . ive had dirt , grease , saw dust etc . all over my watch and all it took was a rinse under the faucet and it was back to normal . the dinky led on the left of the screen really doesnt illuminate much . but for the most part , its better than nothing . overall , i highly recommend it for its durability and value . 
very nice slim watch , keeps perfect time , watch is backlit , this is all the review i can add as this was a purchase for my spouse , he seems very happy with the purchase . 
i own several swiss watches that cost several thousand dollars , but i still wear the casio f - 91w more than any other . why ? accuracy , efficiency , low cost , comfort and style . i absolutely love the fact that the f - 91w keeps better time than any swiss chronometer . it ' s a social commentary perhaps , but the utilitarian aspects of the f - 91w make it very worthwhile for many people . 
simple , clean , geeky , stylish , dummy proof , awesome . just hope the feds don ' t bother me . this watch is just like i remember it . 
i bought this based on reviews that it is very operator and has good battery life . i got it and it feels like a ladies watch . its just too thin and light compared to the g shocks i prefer . if you want to be a tier 1 operator look for a more substantial watch . 
i grew up in the 80s with casio watches . i had this watch as a kid . i bought it again for nostalgia and it ' s a good watch , but it isn ' t as comfortable as it should be . the band is too thick and the buttons stab the back of your hand . other than that , it does what it needs to do , it ' s waterproof and . . . . . . that ' s it . oh , the night light isn ' t nearly as effective as modern indiglo watches so if nighttime viewing is important to you i would pass on this watch . 
it works just like it did back in the 70 ' s . son # 2 bought this for himself and likes it . his father and i laughed our heads off . kids these days . . . 
my husband got this watch as a present ; it ; s just like one he used to have . pros : great price , light weight , easy to set - - he ' s pleased to be able to see when the alarm ' s turned off . cons : i ' m sure the band won ' t last long ; the lighted face lights up only on one little spot on the left - hand side , so you can see the hour but not much else ; band is a little short - - he ' s a large but not fat person ; booklet says not to expose it to water , while the face says " water resist , " so who knows . not fabulous , but works for us . 
i plan to give this as a hs grad gift to a young sports enthusiast . it is attractive , and affordable so i am hoping it will be well received . 
i ordered this casio men ' s f91w - 1 classic black digital resin strap watch for my son who is in college he never had a watch i ordered it for his birthday luckily it arrived on his birthday he was surprised when he opened the box he was amazed how much he really liked it , he wore it right away , for the price what i paid the quality was greater . i also looked other places for the similar designs they cost arm and a leg . amazon thank you for everything you bring us the customers great qualities for low prices . 
at least with this watch i could reset for my time easily . it ' s thin , light - weight , not as rugged as i was looking for but it serves it ' s purpose without randomly going off like the last one i bought . 
let ' s face it , there is something a smart phone cannot do : be there on your wrist for the quick glance of time . i found this nostalgic watch in black with gold trim / buttons and it looked awesome so i snatched it right up ! i like it because there ' s a nice , classic , minimalist look to it that says " who cares if your watch is $ 1000 + . . . i ' m just as accurate as well as disposable ! " it does everything a watch should do and the best part is it ' s very comfortable , doesn ' t rip out arm hair , and i forget it ' s even on because it ' s so seriously light in weight . the battery will last 7 years and replacements are cheap . the back is also removed by 4 small phillips head screws to change the battery . at first i felt like the face was kind of small but after a few days of not snagging on anything i realize that i like it this way . my wrist is a little small so i can ' t say it will fit everyone , and it ' s light bulb on the side is very old school design but it least it has a light and won ' t leave you hanging in the dark . this watch isn ' t designed to be immersed in water , but some people say it does fine as long as you don ' t push the buttons . i prefer to not find out . . i haven ' t tried to go through the airport yet with it so i will keep you posted if i get blamed to be a terrorist or something . but hey , if this watch is the official watch of al - qaeda , then that must say something about it ' s reliability being preferred for anything requiring a timer . . . update : a week after i bought this watch i have noticed that when gently moved next to my ear something is rattling inside of it . although it still works fine , it ' s a little disappointing since i have not banged it against anything or have done anything slightly abusive for the matter . i took it back and upgraded to a 5600e g shock . 
watch works fine after almost 2 yrs . use . would buy again . took off one star though because watch band is a bit short and am just able to close the excess strap with the clasp around my wrist . could be a problem for those with larger wrist if don ' t want extra strap length sticking out . 
the band is very short . it is probably ok for kids or women , but a guy will have difficulty even putting the watch on . i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too . i was also dismayed to find that it does not display the month , only the day . typically not an issue , but still , cheesy . 
this watch reminds me so much of my childhood . i wanted to get a cheap ( & lt ; $ 10 ) watch that i could use when travelling and to the gym and this fits the bill perfectly . bonus ! the watch also has a little side light which allows you to check it in the dark . 
i ' ve had a few f91w series watches , and they ' ve all been reliable . they ' re so inexpensive , and run so long on the original batteries , they ' re pretty much disposable . i don ' t wear a watch on my wrist , but strap them to my backpack . just to try it out , though , i put my new f91w - 1 watch on my wrist . . . or , rather , i ~ tried ~ to put it onto my wrist , but it didn ' t fit . i ' m not lou ferigno or the big show , and i could barely touch the tip of the strap to the very tip of the buckle . i compared it to my older f91w , and it too had a small strap . a no - name watch from hong kong with another " standard men ' s strap " was a good centimeter longer . it ' s not a problem for me , since i don ' t plan on wearing it , but it ' s something to keep in mind when purchasing this watch . as a timepiece , the f91w - 1 still great . accurate , rugged , water resistant , inexpensive and very plain looking . i ' ll trust my life to it as a timepiece , but apparently i won ' t be wearing it unless i buy a new strap . 
i bought it to be able to check the time in the dark ( as i ' m sleep training my 6 months old baby ) and it does the job . you can see the numbers very clear and it doesn ' t light up the entire room ( baby has never noticed ) . it ' s very light weight . i ' m wearing it all the time , take showers and baths with it and so far , so good . the only thing i didn ' t like it ' s that the latch in the belt is black . 
i just wanted a simple , non bulky watch , so i found this online and decided to get it . does exactly what its suppose to , show date and time . the hourly time signal is just a bonus : ) 
i use this watch for nursing school . it has everything i need . regular & military time , stop watch , & alarm . it ' s thin and comfortable . the plastic band makes it easy to disinfect . its cheap too so i ' m not extremely careful with this watch . the only reason i did not give it a five star is because the light is pretty useless . 
it ' s small and cute ! i ' m not a pink fan but i love this watch . casio ' s just last forever . i love love love it . 
casio f - 91w . easy and intuitive to set up , has stopwatch , light , 24hr and 12hr time , month , date , day , alarm , it ' s light , it ' s inexpensive ( got mine for ten bones ) . . . but not a cheap piece of cr @ p . it doesn ' t have year or daylight savings time or time zone or calc or games and the band is simple plastic , not particularly comfortable or uncomfortable . it is what it is and it ' s pretty nice for what it is . stainless steel back . if cvs or longs even bothered to sell stuff like this anymore it would probably be about thirty bucks . but i think it ' s too high - quality for them to carry anyway . seriously . what has become of us . water resist works ; i ran the tap over it for a while then dunked it in a glass of water repeatedly then left it soaking for a while . no problem , watch is fine . made in thailand . 
it ' s a tough little watch . used this during nursing school and still using it as an rn now . i like the low - profile , which can be hard to find with other sports watches . i almost got the pink version of this , but the black looked more professional and matches everything . 
this watch did not last long at all . the watch band ripped off within a week , then the whole thing began to glitch out . was in the trash can , sadly enough after 2 weeks of attempting to get it fixed , nearly paying way more than what i paid for it to begin with ! 
just ok . the band is short . the light is worthless . maybe one tenth of the area is lit at all . a cheap , lightweight watch . 
when it comes to technology , i am a utilitarian . in other words , i don ' t want to spend money on a bunch of features that i don ' t really need . i remember wearing a watch just like this as a kid during the 1980s , and it served its purpose just fine . it also lasted a long , long time . so when i needed a cheap watch to wear while exercising , i decided to buy the same kind that worked for me all those years ago . what you get here is a durable and tough watch that will tell you what time it is and beep when it ' s time to wake up . it ' ll also work underwater . that ' s about all it does . if this set of features is what you want , this watch is probably the absolute best value available . if you like no - frills , plain - and - simple - tried - and - true products , sporting a watch like this is a good way to show it ! 
i had a similar watch for years ; never had a problem with it ( i would get batteries at kmart and sears - but then 1 time i went to a jeweler instead and he spent an hour to put the battery in and broke the watch so that it was dead - never again to a jeweler ) i tried another watch and was very disappointed - day hard to read , discolored and broken band in less than 2 years . now i have found the same style again - easy to read both time and date , easy to set without even looking at instructions ( though i did have my old one for many years ) like everything about it , comfortable strong band . so happy i found this casio watch . great price too . 
great , classy , sleek and simple in a good way . this watch looks great for everyday wear and works great as well . 
it is impossible to pull the band back to get the peg out and take the watch off . i think the band will be gone in a few months because of how hard i have to pull to get it off . also , the & # 34 ; night light & # 34 ; is terrible and doesn ' t illuminate well at all . and the main ink display isn ' t dark enough . sometimes i have to squint in broad daylight to see the timetwo stars for being nonetheless inexpensive and disposable . 
not too bad for the price . . . . simple . . . not flashy or exciting . . but does the job . waiting for a new better replacement now . . . get what you pay for 
this watch is inexpensive , not cheap , and holds up . i had the analogue version of this watch which succumb to the water torture i put it through , so i stepped it up and bought this bad boy . got to go digital , it ' s 2013 , okay . . . the ladies love it . the grandmas love it . and personally i wouldn ' t go without it . the digital format is pretty regular , it is effective in that it keeps proper time , and i can do second by second planning . i would say if you want to spend $ 10 properly , and you need a watch , get yourself this guy . it is as it is advertised , nothing more , nothing less , and the delivery was fast . 
i just wear the watch for the gym so i was looking for an inexpensive one that i wouldn ' t mind having scratches and wear / tear on . this is a simple watch which suited my needs perfectly . the only annoying thing is when you cycle through the mode ( time , alarm , stopper ) , it enters the reset time mode . also , each time you press a button it beeps . it doesn ' t have a timer or an alternate time mode which is just fine with me . 
i think it ' s a great , water - resistant clock , stopwatch , and calendar . the buttons are a little mushy , but they work fine . the only minor annoyance is that the backlight button has to be held down , unlike some others that light up for 3 seconds or so after you ' ve tapped them . 
i just wanted a reliable watch for when i play sports . i loved this watch . i works perfectly . i would definitely recommend it . 
this watch was a gift for someone . when i got it i thought it was a nice elegant watch . i own a fossil myself ( no , not a bone ) . 
this is a great watch for the price i paid . if you are on a budget and want to look nice , this watch is for you . 
i ' ve been using since i ' ve buy it , its great , it has fall down to the ground and nothing happen , looks elegant and it ' s an excelent quality / price relation 
who when this watch was delivered , i thought someone made a mistake , cause it is so awesome it ' s another must . 
that may seem like a bit much over an inexpensive casio watch but i really do like this watch a lot . i had broken my old watch a couple of years ago and a local national chain of discount department stores was having a watch sale . so i dropped by and of all the watches they had , this one jumped out at me . it ' s mineral crystal is beautiful and the deep blue watch face is extremely attractive . so for $ 25 . 00 , i walked out with a new watch . it ' s very well made , heavy duty with a nice wide easy on bracelet style band . it is minimalist as far as features . there is no night light or night dial so you won ' t be able to see the time in the dark unless you have a key chain flashlight , which i just happen to have so that ' s not a problem . and it is water resistant down to 300 ' which i can attest to since it ' s gotten wet or completely submerged numerous times . one of the stylish features is a ring around the crystal which when under lights , throws refracted light in hundreds of different directions , giving a jeweled affect , which makes it look more like a jeweled rolex than a casio . so if you are looking for a nice but inexpensive gift for your husband , or just need a good watch for work , this is one to consider . in fact , now that i ' ve found it here , i ' ll be ordering another one as a backup replacement for the one i have , which unfortunately , i just hit very hard and gouged the bezel deeply . i am so glad i found this watch again on amazon . com ! 
watch is good , color is good but not fit for small size wristi took because fiber and leather strip combination was excellent but due my small wrist it was loose in my hand . 
i bought this casio watch to replace another casio that i bought about 13 years ago . that watch still has the original battery in it and runs great . i have had great luck with these watches as long as the band - prongs don ' t break . it is very comfortable and will last a long time . thanks ! 
after the resin strap on my super cheap casio finally broke , i decided to replace it with a super cheap casio with a nylon strap - in the hopes that it would last longer . i settled on this watch - although the name says & # 34 ; resin strap & # 34 ; the strap is actually nylon and some leather - like material . on the plus side , it has the usual basic watch functions , is low - priced and seems sturdy . on the minus side , the aesthetics are a bit & # 34 ; bleh & # 34 ; and it is a bit annoying to set . to set it , you have to push the mode button 3 times ( from the time & # 34 ; screen & # 34 ; ) to get to the set mode . the 12 / 24 hr button changes the numbers . to move between the number ( seconds to minutes to hours etc . ) you need to push the light button . you also need to wait a bit before switching again - if you push the button twice or more quickly it will just switch once . push mode again to get out of the setting mode . 
often invaded company casio world of products and models , is flooded each eye and hit all heard ! economic well - known products from cheap to very expensive and with the amazing features , and versatility is hard to describe , and this product is a venerable brand creations , & this product is especially for those who prefer the size of the average and suit them , each casio products against water and water - resistant and fully real , competitive price amazon prices compared with other vendors and good customer service and shipping distinctive 
this watch is your typical casio watch . it works well and lasts forever , or until the color all wears off and it looks like it ' s been through the war . what i want in a watch isn ' t much , to be water resistant for swimming and showering and such , for the band and watch to last a long time , to be accurate , to have a light that makes it easy to see in the dark , and to have all the information i need at a glance such as the date , day of the week , and digital time . this watch fits the bill , as do many , many others on the market . this watchband is comfortable in that it ' s fabric , but i like my bands loose , and this watch always slides around to underneath my wrist and i ' m always putting it back on top of my wrist , which is a bit annoying . other than that it ' s a typical inexpensive casio watch with good crisp digital lettering that is easy to see , and a light button that is easy to light up and see . however , casio should put a delay on the light so that it stays on for a few seconds after you press the button . but it only stays on as long as you hold the button down . they ' ve tried to put just about everything on a watch , but all i ' ve ever really used were the basics . a watch that gets the basics right is what impresses me . i assume in the future the pebble type watch will be all the rage , but will they hold up to abuse ? hmmm . 
my timex sport watch served me well for years but was not the most attractive timepiece by a long stretch . at the end of a particularly thorough online search for the blandest , cheapest digital watch i could find , this one came in first place . there isn ' t a whole lot to say about it and that is the point ; it " goes " well with about any combination of clothing , and it has all of the stopwatch and timer functions one expects of a basic digital watch . the resin band fits my spindly wrists adequately , and the backlight deserves particular praise , as it actually causes the numbers to turn a turquoise color , which is neat . 
been a casio watch owner for over 30 yrs ; these are dependable and serve the basic purpose of displaying time ; very good value . 
i have had this watch for about 3 months as a replacement for another brand that finally malfunctioned after many years of frequent wear . this watch simply doesn ' t keep the right day and date . it reverts to jan . 1 and friday . i have been wearing watches for decades and this is the worst watch i ' ve ever had . the watch ' s crystal somehow got dry paint on it within a week , and i didn ' t treat it harshly . the paint eventually came off . i ' ve had the problem that some reviewers mentioned of previous watches breaking where the metal pin connects to the main ( round ) part of the watch , but i don ' t remember what brand they were , maybe this one . next time i buy a watch i ' ll ensure the crystal ( clear window ) of the watch is recessed below the rest of the watch so if i put it face down somewhere the crystal won ' t get scratched . otherwise the watch is fine but the scratches are disappointing . 
quite happy with this watch , not g - shock bulky , slim and rugged looking . numbers light up , no tiny led which is the deal sealer for me . haven ' t gone for a swim with it yet , we will see . light and comfortable on the wrist . time and date clearly visible in all light conditions . seriously , for 20 bucks its a bargain here in australia . if you have smaller wrist and don ' t like the massive other casio watches , this one ' s for you . ticks all the boxes for me . update : a year on and still works great , my wife uses it for work eveyday . 
i ' ve owned or own about 5 casio watches and have always been happy with the low price as compared to their great durability and long life . however , i should have checked the size of this watch before ordering because it is undersized unless you are ordering for a smaller wrist ( i . e . child or female ) . i would not recommend this to a guy for this reason . instead , consider casio 87h - 1v 
this is a great watch , ok to wear in the water , has all reasonablefunctionality you could actually use , durable , illuminated face at a price that makes it a no brainer . 
i purchased this watch for my 8 year old son and so far ( 30 days in ) it ' s been working and functioning . the watch is perfect size for kids or men with really small wrists . 
i used the casio w - 93h wristwatch for about 8 - 9 years before the battery died . despite the low price , it was a great watch that kept very accurate time ( i only reset it twice a year when going on or off daylight saving time ) . during this period , i was active in scuba diving , and i wore the watch on hundreds of ocean dives , going as deep as 100 feet . when the battery finally died , i bought another w - 93h , which i ' m still wearing , although i ' m no longer diving . i bought the new one because i doubted if the old watch would maintain its watertightness after opening up the watch and disturbing the seal to put in a new battery . but i went ahead and changed the battery ( a cr 1616 lithium battery that costs about $ 2 . 00 ) , and that watch is still keeping good time for a nephew who i gave it to . for such an inexpensive watch , it ' s loaded with features . i seldom used some of the features like the alarm and stopwatch , but it was very convenient to have them there on occasions when i did need them . the illuminator light was one feature that i did use often , and it was great to be able to read the watch even in total darkness . the casio w93 - h is such a good watch that i ' ve bought several more over the years for birthday and christmas gifts . 
i ' ve been through a few casio watches over the last 25 years . i ' ve bought this model a couple of times and it ' s the watch i currently wear . while i could easily afford a fancier timepiece , i really just want to know what time it is . this watch does the job . it will go for months without needing a correction . i doubt that any watch keeps noticeably better time than this . the stopwatch feature is also occasionally useful . fine watch if you don ' t need to show off . 
es un reloj muy economico , excelente para un regalo sencillo . muy delgado y f & aacute ; cil de leer los n & uacute ; meros . con la calidad casio de siempre . 
i love watches . . these casio vintage style watches are great beaters for when i don ' t want to wear my $ 100 + fashion watches ! never had a problem with batteries like others have mentioned . . maybe they ordered old stock . this watch is on the small side . . the dial is tiny compared to the big watches i wear . . also , the amazon description mentions that this watch has a mineral crystal . . mine was plastic all around ( except for the back case ) so maybe the new versions have a plastic crystal now . . overall , well worth the price ! ! 
i sthe 4 casio watch like that i bought for my dad , and he really love it , he loves the big numbers and the quality of the watch . . . very good and cheap option 
quite comfortable casual watch for everyday use easy to combine with a pretty supportive . received at a fairly fast since you make the purchase . 
for an inexpensive watch it looks very professional and handles very well . when wearing it it works nicely with every outfit i have to wear and upon looking at it briefly a person could not tel the difference as to if it were a much more expensive watch . great materials and highly recommend for such a great price . 
my son loves it and wears it daily . 
if you need an accurate , simple , and reasonably sturdy watch , this is a good option . this is one of my backup watches , which i keep in my day pack , which i tend to loan out for friends . this is a unisex watch , with a short strap . i ' m not particularly beastly , and this watch just fits on my wrist , on the very last hole . it fits my smaller friends much better , including two petite ladies ' wrists . it ' s easy to set , and has been accurate within 1 / 10th of a second ( as close as i can perceive ) for over a month . very no - frills , but it ' s excellent for what it is . 
not expensive and easy on the eye and wrist . good work watch - if you break it another 10 bucks gets you another one . 
great work watch , it got here fast too . and if you work with your hand it ' s just what you need , a simple watch and it ' s just like the picture , . 
this is the perfect simple watch for me . i dont need alot and it doesnt do alot . perfect match we have . it does tell me what time it is . this watch is an excellent value ; durable and attractive . for less than ten dollars you cant go wrong with the great black watch . 
cheap light and easy to read . the crystal on my nice skagan broke at work and i needed a stand in to wait for repair and return . fills the bill in every regard . 8 bucks to my front door . perfect . 
good size and looks just as the picture . it is a little thin and doesn ' t have a big wrist band but is good overall especially for the price . will definitely buy again if need another watch ! ! 
needed a watch , got a watch . works great . its nice and simple and the gold really classes it up just a bit . its pretty thin and small , which is really what i was looking for , so i ' m happy . 
i actually bought this for myself ( female . . . ) because i really liked the look of the larger face ! it ' s sleek , classy , easy to read , and very lightweight ! 
i am a 65 year old woman - - - - - i love this watch because it is a little larger than the typical woman ' s watch of this same style , yet it still looks good on me , not bulky , or too large - - - - - - - - and with the black face , it adds a little bit of a dressier aspect . an all around great watch for work , activities and even when you want to get dressed up a bit more . 
it is a very cheap watch that fits its purpose very well . it shows the time with precision . discreet and durable . you can bath with it . 
i have been a casio watch user for over 25 yrs . their watches serve a purpose : dependable time at an incredibly affordable watch . 
value wise , you won ' t find a better watch . . . $ 10 for a casio that is built well and stylish enough you can wear anywhere . the plastic straps are pretty thin , but strong . for the money , it ' s a great deal . this is my casual " everyday " watch i typically wear to work and on weekends 
this watch is stylish , gold design looking very good , but still this watch is very small , sometimes i think it is for kids : ) 
good news first . ok watch for $ 10 . i bought to wear when working in yard or fishing . works fine . ok . . . . . . . . . . . . . ever read , hear , or see gulliver ' s travels . this watch would be perfect for the race of lilliputians , a very tiny bunch of people . it is small , really small . 
as an oldtimer , i grew up with analog watches powered by mainsprings . they weren ' t very accurate , and you had to remember to wind them every day . in later years , i switched to battery - powered digital watches , but i always missed the old - style watches . this watch is an ideal compromise - an analog watch with an accurate quartz movement . it ' s extremely accurate and looks great for either casual or business settings . if you want a very affordable analog watch , and you don ' t mind giving up the day / date function , this is a great watch . 
i ' ve read reviews that these will work for swimming and submersing but they do not . they are only water resistant . the reviewers on amazon saying that they would be waterproof were very very lucky . their watches are probably broken now . if you need a waterproof watch , get a g shock or the dive watches . there are some for $ 15 although bulky . i thought i could get away with these watches in water activity but they will fog up and fail . the first lasted a while and that ' s why i just bought another one . these are thin too so i really wanted that but now i am moving to the cheap dive watch . i completely regret believing the incorrect reviews so i am adding my own . only use i ' d see this for is general sports activity where sweat may get on it and you needed to rinse every once in a while . 
i bought one in the store a & # 34 ; long & # 34 ; time ago . and when i saw it here i had to purchase again . i use it every day and love it ! note : the first one fell off my wrist and was lost . 
this watch it look good but it feel very small more suited for a woman then a man . i wear usually casio and i know they are not the biggest watches but , this felt to small for my arm other then the size it pretty good for a small guy . 
as a new professor , i decided that it was finally time for me to own my first watch . i wanted something simple and not too flashy . i ' ve received a number of compliments on this watch already . . . and people are consistently surprised and impressed when they learn that i bought it for around $ 15 . i ' m not going to claim that it looks or feels like an overly expensive watch but it definitely doesn ' t look cheap . i think that it ' s an incredible value and i ' m extremely happy with my purchase . some other reviewers mentioned that they ' ve had issues with scratches on the face . i actually just swiped my watch along a concrete wall the other day and there are now a few scratches on the places watch face . it ' s still perfectly easy to read the time but i will be trying to buff them out this evening . i will update this review once i do this , in order to let other potential purchasers know how concerned they should be about scratches . overall , great watch ; great value . 
i love it because it is small , easy to fasten , light weight , and inexpensive . i had to cut the band for a smaller wrist , but glad i bought the watch . 
i now have several of these fine , inexpensive watches simply because i fear the day that casio will realize that it ' s too great a bargain and withdraw it . beyond the fact that it keeps excellent time , there are some more subtle virtues . it doesn ' t look expensive or cheap . it ' s looks black and discretely sophisticated . it goes with anything including , i ' m told , i ' ve never tried it , a shower or a swimming pool and , if it does and things don ' t work out , at the price offered you can easily , quickly ( it ' s on the prime list so there ' s no cost in shipping and it arrives promptly in a couple of days . . . ) and no one knows - or probably care - that you ' ve had to replace a watch . ( a friend suffered the embarrassment of having to take a & # 34 ; used & # 34 ; smart phone to the repair place . so far so good . they had questions about certain & # 34 ; substances & # 34 ; that were found in it which was when it was revealed that it was recovered by a plumber from a clogged toilet . it ' s reliable , comfortable and the only slight negative is that if it ' s very hot , your wrist might sweat a bit . of course , if it ' s that hot , other places will also be sweating and who will care about a sweaty wrist ? and if you ' re paranoid about sweaty wrists , at the price you can easily have a spare that is dry and ready to roll . an excellent purchase which i ' ve had for several years . and worth every month of it . 
a little thin , but it ' s alright . it works fine and it looks nice with casual wear , for ten bucks , it is well worth it 
i bought this watch for my son for christmas , and i could not wait til then so i give it to him earlier he was very happy to have it . , he really liked it . 
plus : watch arrived on time . cons : watch is for husband as part of a surprise along with another watch . first glance at it , disappointment is the only word to describe how i felt . the watch doesn ' t look as nice in person as the picture even though it is the right product . i have a feeling that it is not 100 % new , because the manual was not placed at the right section and the watch hands were already moving . generally a new watch would not come as such to prevent the battery from being drained . i may have to give this to hubby early instead and if he doesn ' t like it as a generic watch to wear around , then i will have to return it . i will update again after getting a closer look at this watch later . update 1 / 9 / 2013 : i upgraded from 3 stars to 4 because i gave the watch to hubby last night who seems to like it more than me . when he removed the plastic off of the dial , the watch did become better looking in my opinion . hubby said it is a cheap watch so he doesn ' t have to worry about scratching it like his other watches . the band length is good and fits his wrist fine . 
for the price . this is a nice watch for the price under $ 10 . i wanted a watch to wear for casual and for working in the yard , walking dogs . a watch that i would not be worried about breaking . this fits the bill . 
i am quite happy with this watch . some might think it looks cheap , but i bought it just so i know what time it is and could care less whether somebody else thinks it ' s cheap looking . 
surprisingly good for the price . i really like the slim profile of this watch as well as the looks ! definitely worth the price . 
this is a nice watch at an excellent price . looks good on my wrist , very few features and that is a good thing . it tells time , what more do you want ? i also bought a casio sports watch at the same time that has way more features than i will ever use . this watch is for dress up , the other for sports . can ' t beat the price for a simple watch . 
my watch arrived on time in good condition and i loved the price . i thought the band would be a bit thicker but that is something that gets lost through pictures . i am please with my product , its price , and the condition it arrived in . 
my grandson wanted a watch . just a regular plain old analog watch . no bells or whistles needed . this fit the bill to a t . clean lines and a great value . he ' s thrilled and so am i 
i bought this watch strictly for when i am working outside and i don ' t need to be so careful with my watch . it is very light and if i wreck it , i ' ll get another new one . i am very happy with it . 
i like this watch and the way it looks . it is lightweight and i don ' t have to worry about it breaking when it gets wet once in a while . it is smaller than the average men ' s watch but that ' s a plus for me because i have thin wrists . the only negative i found is that it isn ' t scratch resistent , so i did end up with a few minor scratches . but for ten bucks , it ' s worth its money and i am left quite satisfied . 
these casio watches stand the test of time . they ' re well made , and can take a beating and for the price , you don ' t feel guilty if it gets scratched . they fit an adult male well , but these would also be good for the active kid . they ' re not battery eaters , and they ' re unusually reliable . 
for some reason i thought this watch was steel and got it for my husband for christmas turns out it was plastic so i kept it for myself works great 
i love this watch so much . i ' m usually very picky when it comes to watches . it fits great and does not irritate my skin like most do . i can wash the dishes with it on or wash my hands and it still works . 
the casio men ' s mq24 - 1e analog watch is like a friend who doesn ' t put up with small talk . it doesn ' t give a rat about life ' s deeper questions like " why are we here ? " , " what happens when we die ? " , or " what is today ' s date ? " it doesn ' t have any of these answers , because it doesn ' t care . it cares about one thing , and that one thing is the current time . it doesn ' t even care if it is am or pm . hell , it doesn ' t even have numbers on the dial . you have to figure that stuff out for yourself . it ' s made of plastic , because nothing says " i do not care " like plastic . black plastic . it costs $ 10 . if you buy a $ 10 wristwatch you are either so old that you think a high - quality watch should cost less than a low - quality beach - towel , or you do not care about the quality of your watch as long as it tells the time . even if you get one that doesn ' t keep good time , it cost you $ 10 . you spent more money on coffee and lunch yesterday . way more . i bought this watch , and i couldn ' t be happier with it . i think it ' s at the bottom of a suitcase in my closet , but i ' m sure if i went and looked for it , it would still be keeping perfect time and not caring about any of my other time - related questions . i won ' t though . 
if you need a simple , elegant looking watch for about $ 10 , this is it . . . it is a casio and would last a long time . [ i have used several casio watches before and i know about their quality and reliability . . . should serve for two years with the battery inside ; no frills and additional features like alarm or timer or stop watch ; no backlighting or led lamps as in other casios ; no date and day either . . . simple watch with a center second - - - note that this is analog . . . so looks well on your wrist , like a classic design watch ; perfect for students and out door guys for tough work . . . cant lose much ; i agree with several reviewers that the band is flimsy - - - if you like replace with better ones - - - have always one or two of these watches for every day tough use . . . it is water resistant which means hand washing and splashes on the watch will not affect the performance . . . . use it wisely at this price point and you will have a good opinion of casio watches and would buy more of such watches at low cost . . . this watch even boasts of & # 34 ; japan movement ' - - - only ' cased ' or assembled in china , i presume with automated tools . highly recommended ! ! 
this is a cheap watch and works well . when it breaks , i ' ll buy a new one and not worry about repairs . 
keeps perfect time and has nice plain styling . all i want is a watch , and this only displays the time using three hands . it doesn ' t even display the date . great price . 
rate 5 , i order this product for a male friend , i guess he like the product , i guess he would tell a friend 
among all the bulky and expensive watches out there , i was so happy to find the retro casios from my childhood . this watch is waterproof , slim , precise and has light and the basic functions . i have the brown one too , and switch by the mood . as others have written , the case is chromed plastic , not steel . however , the chrome coating is thick and the watch is quite durable . further , it is so light it is a pleasure to wear . i couldn ' t imagine wearing another watch ever again . highly recommended . 
i had the f - 91w for a few weeks before i decided to try this watch out . i picked it as a & # 34 ; fancier & # 34 ; alternative to the plastic straps that the f - 91w had . i was excited to see the shiny polish and clear display but was left a little disappointed in the material that they chose to use for the band . i know , its a sub 15 dollar watch . but i wouldnt count on this watch surviving a tight pocket carry or being at the bottom of my gym bag . i still think its a little better looking than the f - 91w due to the nice polish of the enclosure . but wish it had a little more durability . 
for an inexpensive wrist watch this is a great product . very nice design , easy to read the date and time on this watch . i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good reliable time piece . 
i own rolexes and breitlings but i wear this watch everyday . why ? because it ' s cooler and doesn ' t look like you ' re trying too hard . the ladies see me and they ' re like , finally , this guy not trying to impress me and then i go home with them . 
this watch has most of the features i like - - just wish i could find a digital watch that connected with the nat ' l time setting thing ( i can ' t remember the name ! ) . overall , the casio digital bracelet watch has been a good buy and is of good enough quality . 

easy to read time and date - easy to set for services - easy to put on , take off . always on time . what else could one want ? and just look at the low price ! 
you just can ' t buy a better watch than this for the money . there ' s a reason they ' re still the same after all of these years . 
this is a very snazzy little watch that doesn ' t look at all unfeminine . i wear it to work every day and it has been flawless in timekeeping . eaisier to set than most multi - function watches . the only reason i gave it only 4 stars is because i wish the digits were either bigger or bolder for easier reading without my glasses . other than that , it is sleek , beautiful and does it ' s job very well . 
very good product and is original , i have purchased other watches of this brand are very good that i bought for the pope from my wife and satisfied is a retro model of good quality waterproof and belt fits well is good size . 
gave a s a gift . recipient seems to be very pleased with the watch . has had no problems with it so far . 
i first encountered this watch in a big - - box store , and found it a good value . it ' s got an alarm which is excellent for travel , a stop watch which i seldom use , though good to have in a pinch . in the default mode , it shows the time ( duh ! ) , the date and the day of the week . it seems to keep good time ( though it is hard to get it adjusted to the second ) , so that ' s a plus , since i hate to be late . the only downside to the watch is it ' s limited lifespan . it will inevitably break at the area that attaches the watch band to the watch itself . the old , old version of the watch was solid stainless steel . it lasted forever . the newer version is chrome - colored plastic , and just doesn ' t hold up as well . oh , well , such is life . 
this watch has been made for at least 30 years now . i went for the chrome a158w , instead of the plastic f91w , which is the same watch , internally . i suspected the bracelet would be a hair - puller , and i was right . as a watch collector , i expected that , and i put a swiss army strap on it ; much better . i really wanted the dressy chrome look on the watch head , and i figured i could dress it back up again in the future with a glossy lizard strap . the feature set , you can read about on casio - usa ' s website , so i won ' t go into that much . the key things to note from ownership and use are as follows : + simple . everything ' s easy to use and set if you take 2 minutes with the manual . if you ' re familiar with casios , you won ' t even need the manual . + very light and thin . there ' s no other watch that packs this level of features and legibility into such a light package . when i ' m wearing this watch , i forget that it ' s on , sometimes . - hair - puller bracelet . ok for asians , not so good for the rest of us . - no countdown timer . i miss this useful feature , but in many cases , the alarm can be used instead . + loud beeper . it is not sealed up so tight for waterproofness ( this one ' s only rated as splashproof ) that it makes the alarm notably quieter . - led sidelight is barely adequate . there ' s a similar model with & # 34 ; electro - luminescence & # 34 ; that is no - doubt better in this regard . i knew that going in , but i felt the big blue & # 34 ; electro - luminescence & # 34 ; banner on the watch face kind of ruined the 80s look of it . ( yeah , i ' m an nerd ) in the long run , i use this as my back - up watch . i leave it in my desk drawer at work for those days when i forget to wear a watch leaving the house in the morning . this is the perfect watch for that duty , as it will run at least 7 years on a battery , if the alarm and light aren ' t used much . 
this is a comfortable and rugged watch with the features i ' m looking for . the alarm tone is very quiet , but other than that i ' m pleased with it . any watch on my wrist gets banged up , but this one has kept it ' s good looks longer that most do . i especially like the watchband closure - squeezing the release buttons is much easier than prying similar latches open with a fingernail , and it has never spontaneously opened like some of my other watches . 
my son loves wearing this watch . it looks dressy but seems sturdy enough for his day in school . plus it was one of the only digital watches we found that also has analog . 
este dise & ntilde ; o tiene una versi & oacute ; n plastica y esta que es la version metalica . he comprado ambas y me gusta mas la version plastica por que esta version metalica hace ver la pantalla como si fuera muy peque & ntilde ; a . tiene otra particularidad y es que el reloj parece que fuera de mucho espesor al ponerselo , significa que si usted es de brazos de poco diametro , este reloj no le va a quedar bien . si usted tiene brazos grandes , el reloj le va a quedar perfecto . sin embargo , el precio bajo , calidad casio y caracteristicas hacen de este una excelente compra . 
casio siempre se ha caracterizado por tener productos de calidad . este reloj ideal para el d & iacute ; a a d & iacute ; a es una excelente opci & oacute ; n como regalo en estas navidades . 
bought this for a friend of mine to give to her father for fathers day . he loved it , she loved it . casio is always a class act . 
great watch with many great features . i love the size of the digital layout and the metal band is durable . to resize the band , push out the pins from the side that looks like screws . pros : accurate , good looking , multiple alarms , timer , and stop - watch . cons : metal band latch sometimes deforms , making it hard to latch . you have to bend it a certain way to make it work . the analog hands sometimes get out of sync with the digital time . you can fix that easily , but annoying sometimes . lastly , at night you can ' t use the watch features . there is a light , but it occupies a button used for setting alarms and such . so if you are setting your alarm , you can ' t see the display . timex has a night feature that , once enabled , turns the light on with every button press . my former watch had it and it was a very handy feature . great for the price . 
it ' s a casio , so i know it will last . just a little disappointed in the weight . i like heavier watches , and this is pretty lightweight . 
i saw it on the site and immediately i liked it . when it arrived , i liked it so much . nice price , nice presentation , excellent funcionalities . 
it ' s decent quality , works just fine , it ' s looks good , but the images are a little bit deceiving ; it is bulgy , with the front part being smaller than the base , it forms a cone shape , that makes it look a little bit cheap . 
this watch worked great . the watch was comfortable and combined the best of analog and digital watch design . it looks really nice too . 
i love it ! i love it for several reasons , but the main reason is that it ' s very light but still metallic . i hate heavy watches , but this one is light as a feather . and i love metal straps because they are quick to put on . and then i love it because it has both a digital and an analog face and has the great range of usual functions of a digital watch . to me casio embodies inexpensive and reliable watches . if you lose it , it ' s not gonna kill you . in fact i have several casio watches all over the house so i never to look for one when rushing out the door . in fact , they are so reliable that my $ 20 casio watch from 15 years ago is still working . the only negative i have about this watch is that it ' s hard to change the time . in fact it ' s so counter - intuitive ( press a five times ? ? ? ) that i ' ve had to open the instruction manual in order to change it , and with dst this year coming at a different date , i ' ve had to manually change it , and it ' s no fun , especially the analog hands which you don ' t have a knob to wind , but have to advance it digitally . but overall , my verdict is that casio is reliable and cheap , and there are hundreds of styles to choose from . 
i bought this watch when my timex gave up after less than 2 years ; i ' ve owned several casio in the past and never had them break after such a short time . the main feature i went for was the ani - digi function . it turns out , that ' s as much a curse as it is a blessing . . . but more on that later . this watch does everything but sing and dance , and it ' s possible that ' s somewhere in the cryptic instruction book too . multiple city times , stopwatch with all the usual bells and whistles , day / date display . here ' s the thing about the analog display , it does not set automatically ! you have to set it by holding down a button ( or two buttons if it ' s a long way off ) while the hands twirl around . and you don ' t set the minute hand and hour hand separately . . . if you ' re off by 11 hours ( daylight savings time ? ) you have to watch the minute hand go around 11 times . and if you miss . . . you can ' t go backwards . . . so it ' s another 11 + hours . this seems really , really silly to me . as advanced as everything else is on this watch , i think setting the analog hands to agree with the digital should be automated . pros : ani - digi displaylarge face / dialvery substantial feel / weightmetal bandcons : hard to adjust fit ( but this is the case for any metal band ) analog setting isn ' t automatedautomatic light feature turns off and must be reset after a certain amount of time . so . . . i think it ' s a good watch , well worth what i paid for it , but it could have been so much better . 
i really like this watch and more if casio brand is the best brand available in terms of watchesregards 
actually . . . i have no idea how well this watch works because when i went to use it the battery was dead . at least i assume it ' s the battery as i haven ' t replaced it yet . sure . . . it ' s a cheap watch but you do expect that it will work for a little while . 
it is a high quality product . i think it was the best choice . ideal , beautiful and elegant ! excellent relationship between product quality , price and service . highly recommended . 
i haven ' t had any luck with casio watches , so i ' m waiting for this one to stop working too . so far , though , it seems to be holding it ' s own . 1 year update , watch still working ! 
i was trying to stay away from the casio brand because it was going to be a gift and i was looking for something a little more ' high end ' . casio seemed to be the only brand that offered the design i was looking for , digital and analog together . this review would be more like 4 . 5 stars , the product has been owned and worn daily for about 3 weeks now , the only draw back seems to be that while it hasn ' t scratched the glass has scuffed easily . apart from that one thing which so far has caused no permanent damage it ' s better than i was expecting . it came in a nice box that i could easily wrap , easy to follow instructions and secure packaging . the features are really cool , multiple alarms , you can set the analog hands and the digital read out to different time zones , it tells you not only the date buy day of the week . the seconds are a digital circular count down . while it ' s a bit large it doesn ' t look bulky or bad at all . i must have looked at 300 watches before deciding on this one and so far i believe i chose the right one . while there are alot of featues a quick read through of the instructions show it ' s actually pretty easy to set things and easy to remember for the next time . overall so far good product and i would reccomend and am glad i chose this for my gift 
i looked for about two weeks at various watches . this casio was the best looking with out looking too cumbersom . it was slightly thicker than other watches which worried me but now i never even thought about it until this review . no problem at all . good illumination , easy to read face and water resistant for casual swimming snd snorkeling . 
i got this watch almost exactly a year ago . the metal parts are sturdy and dependable , but the plastic joints were what let me down . after a while one of the hinges snapped off and rendered the watch useless as there are no replacement bands for that . also , i am still unsure how to get the analog interface to line up with the actual digital time . i read the directions several times . perhaps the error occurred when i set the watch to nyc time , however they still get no points for ease of use . as for the people complaining that the watch is too big , you ' re either going to have to get a remover tool or take it to a jeweler and pay the $ 10 or so for the service . i ' d honestly recommend something with all metal parts . i work my tools pretty hard , but i almost never blow out a watch in a year . my timex iron mans always lasted 2 - 3 years before their bands blew out . 
i use this watch for casual occasions , which for me include coaching when i don ' t have to get to hands on involved . it just looks like it is more than it is but the fact that it has a stop watch and looks like more than it is makes me satisfied . 
now ai am doing this reviwing and i never have this wacth in my habd never arribed i don ' t remembre is too late to reclaimed . i am telling i never had this watch in my hands i forgot to fill a reclamation and this was 2 years ago , i now maybe to late to this is only a commentary to the seller . 
good basic watch with some interesting features . don ' t know how many things like the phone book , stop watch , world time are important . overall , exactly as i expected . would be helpful if they included an owners manual that was a little bigger print ! may have to get new glasses ! ! 
this product was as good as i expected to be ! i am very pleased with my purchase and i highly recommend it ! ! 
i was surprised at the timekeeping of casio . . accurate in 6mos . the band and face looks cheaper than i expected . . but for the money it is worth it . 
i like the watch because of it was reasonably priced and the quality was beyond expectation . highly recommended for others to consider buying . it will be a gift to someone who will appreciate having it . 
bought this watch for my brother in law . first off you have to know how to adjust the strap yourself or your gonna have to take it to the watch shop ( more $ $ $ ) you will need one of those small screw driver sets to push out the pins , take off some links and adjust the length of the ss bracelet . the watch was a bit bulky for my taste and did not ooze of quality but you get what you pay for . tricky to set up so put on those magnifying glasses and read the tiny manual ( belongs in a doll house ) so far my brother in law has not destroyed it ( and he will ) but for the 17 odd bucks i paid , i ' ll buy him another from amazon . the data bank is a plus as is the ten year battery and dual time zone . will update this review as we go along . 
this is a very nice looking watch and very affordable . it is great to have the looks of the analog watch with the features of a digital . however , there are just a few drawbacks : 1 ) the light is awful . pressing the button provides light around the perimeter , but it barely penetrates into the center . in a dark room you have to look closely to see the time . it doesn ' t light up the led portion at all , so forget about setting an alarm or checking the date or a timer . in a dark room the led display is unavailable . 2 ) it should be a good thing that it has this memo feature , but i would have liked to have thought it would be out of the way if not used . as it is , it is one of the things you cycle through . 3 ) the base is plastic . the band and top of the water are metal , but the base , including where the watch band pins go into , are plastic . this is ok , although i did manage to pull one of the pins out when i hit the watch on a doorknob by accident . i needed some epoxy and a small drill to fix , but it was , again , my fault . 4 ) the band is a little hard to resize . see others who gave instructins . i bent a pin when putting it back together but , fortunately could use one from part i had removed . 5 ) slightly convex crystal , so a little easier to scratch than ideal ( more often , with me , is getting white streaks from brushing up against the wall . ) i don ' t mean to say it is a bad watch , just to point out a few small things that might be important to people . again , it is inexpesnive , good looking , and keeps time well , so very good . 
i used this watch for surfing with wetsuit covering it . i soak it in fresh water after every session . i had the other non metal version as well and both leaked . i got them because they were cheap but they just aren ' t made to handle the rigor of salt water exposure and cold / warm temps . i think the battery actually started to give out on one as well . although it ' s a 10 year battery , it ' s warrantied only 1 year . i would not buy this again for surfing or even for casual wear . the metal version bands are cheap looking with the edges a little sharp . the surrounding border around the dials for both the metal aw80d - 1av and the black resin band version both wear out as it ' s a silver paint . underneath is a yellow / off color plastic . i got these for ~ $ 15 so no complaints since i got good use of them but don ' t expect durability or long usage in salt water . 
very nice looking watch and does everything i need it to do . wakes me every morning and that is good for me . 
works great , looks good , and i don ' t have to worry about the battery for 10 years . 
it is one of the best watches i have bought for myself . i rate it with a 5 star because it was a great fit for dressing up . 
i get this a long time ago but i have to submit this review because i received my new watch very fast . actually it is gift from a friend and i really like it . i give 4 stars just because it ' s a little bit big for me but i still wear this watch . good to go ! ! ! thanks 
very nice i gift it to my father he is happy and he like it thank you very nice watch 
it took me a while to realize what an incredible deal this watch is . casio makes good products that always work well and this is no exception . and it is a really nice looking man ' s watch . there are a few things that are not ideal . yes , the crystal is the soft plastic kind that scratches very easily - - but i believe a good plastic polish with very fine abrasive could probably restore it to looking just like new and i hope to try that fix someday ! it ' s irritating when you try to set something on the digital display whenever either or both of the hands are down in the 5 , 6 , or 7 area . sometimes you have to just wait until they move by themselves - - because resetting the analog hands only works in the & # 34 ; forward & # 34 ; direction and , if you move them , it takes a long time to get them back to where they were . finally , i had to keep the tiny manual handy for a few months as the alarm and other settings don ' t seem very intuitive to me . but , once i got them down , i really appreciate what i have for such a low , low price . and , on my watch at least , the lighted dial works superbly whenever i push the light button . it looks great , it works great - - at this price it ' s a real gem ! 
looks nice , good quality band , easy to read both analogue and digital . excellent for the money . this is my second one - - - i lost the first one while traveling in africa . . . it had worked for several years . my wrists are slim so i had to take out two links . . . not tooo hard to do , but not easy either . you need a strong but tiny screw driver to push out the tab . 
buy this product for my father and he loved it , says to use it for special occasions : ) besides offering quality casio 
rate 5 , i order this product for a male friend , i guess he enjoy it , i think he would recommend to a friend 
i have owned illuminator watches in the past and the face always lighted up clearly . this watch has a poor light system and does not deliver what an illuminator watch is known for . i can barely see the dial when the light is turned on at night . 
it has all the basic features , it ' s been durable , and i like the looks of it . but perhaps the best feature of this watch is its ' size . i shopped around for g - shock watches , but they are all ginormous . i have small wrist , and i wanted a larger , but not ridiculously huge g - shock watch . this watch is perfect size for me . my major concern is the band . it ' s beefier , but if i abused it , i don ' t think it would withstand the wear . of course , i don ' t abuse it , and it might prove me wrong ten years from now . for now , it ' s an easy five - star purchase for me . very reasonably priced , and it ' s been a perfect delivery , all - around . 
i have had many watch with many functions . they have all been compared to this one that last over 15 years and i still was not happy again until i bought another . 
priced nicely but sent it back because it was to small for my wrist . i have big wrists and need a big face on my watches .

the casio dw5600e - 1v is a 1996 update to the dw5600c that made it ' s debut in 1987 . the original had a few features that were omitted later . these were : stainless steel caseauto - calendar 1985 - 2029 ( the update spans 1995 - 2039 ) dual time ( i kinda wish they hadn ' t gotten rid of this one ) reminder markbacklight ( tiny incandescent lightbulb ) the 1996 update , which is what is being reviewed here boasts : composite - polymer case ( 30 % lighter ) shock resistant200 meter water resistantalarm ( daily or monthly functionality ) electroluminescent backlight ( blinks during alarms & hourly chimes - can be turned on / off ) 1 / 100 second stopwatchmeasuring capacity : 00 ' 00 " 00 - 59 ' 59 " 99 ( for the first 60 minutes ) - 1 : 00 ' 00 - 23 : 59 ' 59 ( after 60 minutes ) measuring unit : 1 / 100 second ( for the first 60 minutes ) - 1 second ( after 60 minutes ) measuring mode : elapsed time , split time , 1st - 2nd place timescountdown timer with auto - repeat function ( a - r function can be turned on / off ) measuring unit : 1 secondcountdown range : 24 hourscountdown start time setting range : 1 second to 24 hours ( 1 - second increments and 1 - hour increments ) hourly chimeauto calendar12 / 24 hour formatsapprox . battery life : 2 yearsso , what can i say or write about this watch that hasn ' t already been said or written ? i mean , seriously . this watch has been around for 24 years ( 15 years in it ' s current configuration ) . in many ways , it is the perfect watch . it has everything you need and nothing superfluous . in fact , casio calls it the " quintessential g - shock " . i couldn ' t agree more . for almost a quarter - century , this watch has been worn by people engaging in just about any task imaginable , in just about any condition imaginable . even nasa has qualified this particular watch for space - flight missions . if you need the ultimate piece of all - condition gear , the incredibly simple , functional and tough casio dw5600e - 1v will more than fill that need . it ' s a true masterpiece . 
the casio dw - 5600 is approved by nasa for use at the space station and in manned space vehicles ! ( google it ! ) beats the omega speedmaster by far in accuracy and pricing ! it is simply one of the best watches in the whole universe ! i love it ! if you don ' t care for overpriced luxury bling watches , which are expensive to buy , expensive to service , getting magnetized easily and won ' t keep time and are mostly not shock - proof , then the casio dw - 5600e is the watch for you ! not bulky , accurate ( + 7 sec / month ! ) , has all the important functions , is shock - proof and water resistant 20bar . a lithium battery ensures functionality for many years to come . this watch tells others that you are a practical guy who gets the best product for less money and doesn ' t waste his hard earned money for an overpriced watch . go , get it ! ! ! : ) 
i use this watch and almost every function 10 - 20 times a day . it ' s the perfect functional watch . no frills , just features that work . real buttons . immediate access and stop / start / reset of timer and stopwatch . i tried other watches with touch screens , heart rate monitoring , altimiters , etc , and as it turns out those are just worthless marketing gimmicks that didn ' t work ( at least for me ) . their menu ' s were long and complicated and basic features like a timer or stopwatch were buried and hard to get to or unresponsive due to the interface . if all you want is multiple ways to time workouts , runs , rests , or anything else that requires accurate and easy timing , this is your watch . 
the ones i got off amazon were all china models and never kept accurate time . also one had a module that was very crooked in the case . got a thailand model instead of china that is perfect . it says on the back of the watch made in thailand . i bought it at walmart , a few things about the thailand model thats different than the china model : the bezel is the same color black as the strap . ( china model is lighter ) also the buttons on the thailand model stick out more than the china . ( this is important to me because it makes it easier to use ) the numbers are clearer when looking directly at it and finally the white paint that says protection and g - shock on the bezel are a whiter paint that is more crisp and precise lettering . finally the thailand one is accurate to within 10seconds a month and the module lines up perfect . i will keep this watch as long as i can , the features are perfect and its the perfect watch for me right now and i tried a bunch analog and digital . 
the purist cry that the original g - shock was metal and way better . it was tough but heavy . this newer one is lighter and yes , cheaper to make but still tough as nails . you don ' t see many broken ones . look at the price - for that money its hard to get a tougher , more functional watch , in my opinion . great lay - out , bright light ( the light on the original stinks compared to this one ) , ect . this watch has been copied so many times , many may associate it with the cheap clones that resemble it . it may not cost much but it aint cheap . it has everything you need and nothing you dont . its a good dive watch and easy to use . i still love the original but this one is a very good timepiece . if people scoff at your " cheap plastic watch " just laugh at them like youre crazy . mean people leave crazy people alone . try it . it works ! 
this is the only watch my husband wears . he loves it . i dread the day they stop making this model . it is very durable and he says it is a perfect watch to fit his profession because he and the watch are both ' work horses ' . 
i had the original dw5000 in 83 and even now that they have plastic cases , this is still the best and more reliable af all g shocks , the tough solars are not reliable and the atomic time is not necessary , they havent made anything better than this . i been using casios since 83 and for the first time im back with the classic , its a little more compact than the old one and the price is great . i gave it 4 stars because the quality of the band is still terrible , the same as the 80s models . 
this is the only style watch i have worn for over 30 years . they have cheapened them up some over the years so they are not the same quality that they used to be but they are a good watch . this is the only watch i have ever found that survives me for 2 + years . 
my husband loves casio watches and generally buys them at wal - mart , however they didn ' t have any he liked . this watch was similar to an old style he had so i bought for fathers day . he loves it ! ! 
i purchased this watch to use while coaching my kid ' s football team . it has everything i need , and it withstands the elements out on the grid iron . this watch keeps things simple . it really fits my coach image . looks great with gym shorts , t - shirt , and tennis shoes . i also wear it to formal events with suit and tie . it is the perfect tool for coaching . i recommend this watch to any guy that is athletic and requires a watch to keep up with their demanding life style . it achieves perfection through simplicity . the resin band is extremely comfortable and sporty . the rigdes in the band allow for air flow around the wrist where i usually sweat . the display has all of the essential information in the home time keeping mode . 
i am a cook . i have been wearing this watch to work for the last 2 weeks . it comes in to contact with water , grease , chemicals , flour and various types of breading , various food juices , and gets knocked around a lot more than you would think . it has preformed flawlessly . i use the timer and stopwatch all the time since i usually have multiple thing cooking at same time . it has flour paste all over it and i just rinse it off under the faucet at full blast . i will try to give another review after a couple more months . been about 2months now . watch still looks new . i figured out i can take the soft rubber cover off with the 4 screws and clean the gunk that builds up in there . i do this about every other week . it has lost about 1 / 2 min . according to my atomic clock . also i rub a little armor all on the band and outside every once in a while . 
at first i wasn ' t to sure . i was used to your average thick g - shock , i even ponderd returning it . after wearing it for a day i realized how much i didn ' t like my other two g - shocks . all day of physical work and i did not catch or bump anything ( if you wear a g - shock & dont sit on your bum all day in a office you know what i mean ) . all g - shocks are very tough there is no sence in getting into that . this one is a very cool , simple , retro watch that won ' t get in your way , and has a great price tag ! ! ! 
these are great sports watches which are really tough . they look as though they mean business . good value to buy so you can wear it doing anything and not worry about any knocks it might get . a classic . 
u can never go wrong with this ! god i love it ! ! el glow , 200m wr . sturdy , durable , affordable ! casio rocks ! 
bought as a gift for my dad , he just wanted to test in was water resistant , and after several beach and swimming pool days , it was proven . great classic design , day of week calculator ( based on date ) . delivered on time and in perfect condition . 
i wanted a watch that showed time day and date . this watch does all things , and keeps excellent time . i would recommend this timepiece to all . 
i bought this for my husband to wear when he go to work . he loved it . it is all what he ever wanted in a watch . very satisfied . 
i like casio watches . i needed to replace one that had served me well for years . too bad for me that casio has made changes in its design . in particular , on this model , the adjust setting button , which is used for selecting the function you want , is slightly recessed and i simply cannot manipulate it easily with my fingertips . either the mild arthritis i have isn ' t letting me be nimble enough or my fingers are too big . i can do it with a thumbnail if i get it just right or stylus , but not with my finger tip . sorry , but that is not what i want . styling is nice , though , and i still like casio . wound up with one of the humongous g - shock models that has four big buttons . jerry 
like someone else said - this is a 5 - star watch at a 1 - star price . i ' m very pleased with it . everything i need and nothing i don ' t need . hey , it even has instructions that are understandable ! ! on a side note - after many years , we still can ' t figure out my wife ' s digital watch - incomprehensible instructions . that ' s what i wanted to avoid with this purchase . i also wanted to avoid the larger g - shock models - they have a lot that are too bulbous for my wrist . this design is one of the smaller ones - i wouldn ' t purchase anything bigger . alarms ? i only need one . readability - i need good contrast so it ' s easy to read . and , indestructible ! for $ 40 ? i love this watch and highly recommend . 
simple and refined interface . durable . cheap . runs forever . good backlight . solid metal buttons don ' t fall off . simply put , the dw5600 is the platonic form of " watch " - everything a modern watch is supposed to be and nothing it ain ' t . it can also have a neat 22mm or 24mm nylon " zulu " strap attached using casio ' s adapters . 
i have owned other casio watches and they are very accurate , with a great battery life . the only problem i had with a less expensive casio was the watch was great , but the band was junk . and to replace the band cost more that to replace the watch . this watch has a much better band and i expect to have a better chance of wearing it many years longer . this watch is very well built and i expect to get several years of excellent service . i use the stop watch functions a lot to time my rest intervals while weight training . the only negative is the print of the watch face is almost too small to read . good thing the positions can be easily memorized . also , the & # 34 ; adjust & # 34 ; button is very hard to use , but the other three buttons work much better . time will tell but casio is a good bet . 
far and away one of the best digital watches on the planet . the casio 5600e is 30 % lighter than its predecessor the 5600cand therefore feels more comfortable on the wrist , although not ascollectable . also the 5600c featured dual time . however , the styling was left unchanged , except for some very minorcosmetic changes with the writing on the face . you cannot perfect what is already perfected . the comfort is simply amazing for a what appears to be a bulky watch . the g shock has internal dampners installed to provide outstandingshock resistance , including full contact sports , chainsaws , jackhammers , etc , 12 rounds with mike tyson and full cage fighting : - ) not to mention skydiving , space missions and scuba diving . features : classic casio 1980 ' s looks , which many people love . 24 hour stopwatch , but . . . the time is kept displayed , very useful . 24 hour countdown timer , again , with the current time displayed . backlight , which flashes for the duration of the alarm and hourly time chime & timer . one alarm , not 3 0r 5 0r 19 , as some people are annoyed by this , which i find kinda interesting . extremely comfortable resin band . and of course the illuminator . . . bring it on . i could go on all day and night about this watch , or perhaps write a novella on it , or evenbase my whole life memoirs , that is how much i love this watch , but i won ' t , for fears of repercussionsfrom my wife , my boss , my friends , and maybe even casio themselves . 
based on the original design of the very first casio g shock engineered back in 1983 . . . we have the royal king of all g shocks . . . the model 5600 casio g shock . from police officers , to firemen and women , soldiers , first responders , mechanics , explorers , and just good old fashioned hard working men and women . . . we have all come to understand , demand , and depend on the casio g shock family of watches to take a massive beating right alongside us since 1983 . you simply can ' t go wrong buying this classic testament of a watch that can take a beating and keep on ticking . try doing a youtube search on all the stress tests that many have placed g shocks under and you will be amazed . you may never put your watch through the limits of abuse that it can take . but the watch will certainly last you so long that it will become a part of you . a part of who you are as a tough full of potential and dedication individual that can withstand the test of time . cheers casio ! ! great job as always ! ! 
i have expensive watches , well expensive for me in the $ 300 range and i wear this watch over them everyday . keeps great time , comfortable , looks good and functions are easy to learn and operate . great buy for the price on amazon . 
the first version of the g shock , this item is a collection jewel , is a part of watch history ! amazing price ! thanks 
this casio watch g - shock watch is rugged and keeps excellent time . it is a bit thicker than i prefer but it is an excellent every day watch . 
my son is a first responder and needed a sturdy watch that could withstand some abuse . this watch was exactly what he needed . 
at first i bought a casio f91w which after a couple of days i noticed it had something rattling in it . i remembered i once had a g shock i took to brazil and thrashed it for a couple of years and even slept / bathed in it and it was going strong till the day i gave it to my brother in law ( who lost it ) ! it was a different model than the 5600e but lived up to the g shock name , which is why i bought this one . i wanted a watch that i could wear all the time and not worry about , unlike my swiss watches that i have sold because i was always afraid of breaking them . the added 1983 retro style it has is just an added bonus ! this watch is much larger / more manlier in size than the f91w and does not rattle . the green backlight is nice and this watch does everything a watch should . so accurate time keeping you could " set your watch to it . " the best part of this watch is that buttons do mot get pushed accidentally . if you have anything of a stub of a fingernail you should be able to push these buttons just fine . i bought it from amazon , and the ones they sell are authentic , but made in china . i guess they no longer produce these in taiwan , and it seems almost everything these days is now made in china . i am a little crazy and like to modify things so i have already converted mine to a reverse display ( white numbers on black background - there are tutorials online how to do this ) and when i had the case open it said " casio china no jewels " so the movement is also made in china . it still seems built well , other than the top left adjust button is recessed a little more than the others ( it was purposely designed this way ) and the white " g shock " and " protection " writing is actually more of a greyish hue compared to previous models ; which doesn ' t matter to me because i also blacked it out to copy the much more expensive military version of the 5600e . also , while i had the case open there is a small spring that if you pull it out the watch no longer beeps . for me this is a plus : i don ' t like my watches to beep since i prefer to wake up to my cell phone . but beware when changing batteries not to lose this spring if you value the beep . also , see tutorials online if you decide to change the battery yourself - the owners manual states the one supplied will last 2 years or less depending on backlight usage . you can find replacement batteries very cheap on ebay , too . all in all this watch is the perfect size and weight and feels great and i am quite certain it can take a beating and will live up to its name . 
i have always liked this watch , i had my first one when i was 14 years old , since then i ' ve been buying it because it ' s tough and resistant . in the eighties it didn ' t have countdown but not so long ago it has it and it ' s a very useful tool . besides , you can program the alarm to activate the time you want , and of course it is resistant to the water 200 mts , which is very important 
when it has came down to casio , they ' ve continued to know how to make great watches not just in price , but also in style and simple convience . that has shown constantly with their line of g - shock watches for nearly 30 years . that has came the case with this classic g - shock watch . it is definitely a great buy for nostalgia fans of the original casio watches , but also brings out a nice contemporary look for all shapes and sizes . it is a delightful gift for anyone who wants a simple and fun watch , but also handles very well . i like how simple it is not just to setup , but the sleekness it brings out in its bold , black design . it is also a great buy for teenagers , because they love g - shocks . i absolutely recommend this as a great buy from casio , not just in price but in the proof of the watch . price : bconvience & setup : boverall : b 
i hope this helps anyone who cannot decide which g shock to buy . there are a few hundred different models of g shock watches out there . i own a few of them , and they are all great . they are all tough as nails , extremely accurate , and are nice looking , especially if you appreciate gadgets and technology . if i had to choose only one model , it would be this one , the dw5600e . it is simple to set , and has all the information you need at a glance . no need to push the button multiple times . it ' s all there . it makes sense ! ! it looks nice with everything you wear , and the band is soft , but tough , and very comfortable . ( theres a time , and a place for expensive dress watches . ) with the price amazon charges for this model , you really won ' t feel bad about abusing this piece , and believe me , it can take it ! ! please , do not think because the newer models have atomic / solar , multi - band , blah blah blah , they are better . i will say they are more expensive , and bulkier , but definitely not better . interesting technology , but gimmicky at best . if you treat this watch normally , and limit the use of the back light , the batteries last 5 - 7 years or more , very easily . once the watch is set , it is extremely accurate , and may lose seconds over a long period of time . if you want to pay more for new features ( atomic ) that are not necessary , go for it . i learn the hard way that sometimes less is more . in this watches case , it is . i wear all my g ' s from time to time , but this one is on my wrist 90 % of the time . once you figure out that this watch makes the most sense , there ' s no turning back . . . nasa and the military can ' t be wrong about this model . buy one already , you won ' t regret it ! oh and if you have your eye on another g , go for it ! ! in the end you ' ll wish you bought this one . . . 
my first g - shock , looks great , loving the bright green light . the only gripes i would have is ; i wish it had higher contrast on the face or numbers and the adjust button could be just a tad bit further out but for the price and brand name it ' s worth it without a doubt . 
these casio watches have been around for years and still look cool . when i want to throw on a watch while doing laundry instead one of my more expensive watches this is what i wear . 
good watch for an active person . seems to be able to withstand rough treatment . nice stylish looking watch . has good features on it . great for washing auto , doing yard work etc . has withstood all i have put it through so far . would recommend this product and would purchase again . 
this is the only type of watch my husband likes - the casio g - shock . he ' s a machinist and works with his hands a lot , often gets banged up getting into and under machines . he also goes fishing in the ocean ( actually goes into the ocean , up to his hips , surf casting ) and the watch gets wet and sandy . he only replaces them when the band breaks , but the watch is still good . this is the third one he ' s had in 20 years . i ' d say that ' s not bad considering the price . sadly we can never find a band to match so we just buy a new watch each time . ps ) he doesn ' t have the best eyes but he can see the time just fine in daylight or in the dark ( back lit ) . and he finds the alarm easy to program , loud enough to wake him . 
i ' ve always preferred analog watches but after beating up a few decent ones at work i decided to go with the casio . not the greatest looking timepiece but tough as nails . i find that when taking a quick glance while working i need to be more deliberate and angle the watch towards me more than when i had a high contrast analog face , especially in dim light . ( it does have a light but requires a press of a button ) the rubber band though durable and comfortable does trap perspiration under it . i like the " classic " style compared to some of the other style g - shock watches , though relatively large , it ' s not overly so . 
i bought this dw5600e after my casio gw700 started to go goofy on me . my first 5600 survived 28 years . i thought the gw700 would do the same or better , what with atomic time and solar power , oh my . like most reviewers have indicated , after about a year and a half the back light ( way cool blue ) started coming on with minimal arm motion , which drains the battery . the solar power became less and less effective , meaning the bloody watch wouldn ' t hold a charge , regardless of how much direct sunlight the watch was exposed to . i ' m a soccer referee ( albeit in seattle where sunlight is precious ) and often on the pitch from dawn to dusk ( which you would think would be enough sunlight to charge the bleeding battery . ) instead , in the middle of matches , the entire face would go black while the watch communed with the radio signal in colorado or something , for 10 - 25 minutes at a time . " ref , how much time to play ? " uh , i dunno , and run over to an assistant referee and tell him to give me a sign for when the half ends . so i was in the market for a waterproof ( it rains a bit in seattle , eh ? ) , blast proof ( g - shock ) , low maintenance , relatively accurate watch , with some kind of stopwatch / timer that was easy to use , and built without even a nod to planned obsolescence ( sp ? ) . you know , kind of like my first g - shock . 28 years is longer than most marriages these days . anyway , i read a blistering review on amazon from somebody that refocused my priorities : day , date , time , and timer function . and forget about how easy it is not to have to reset the time when changing time zones or going on daylight savings time . forget about solar power which only lasts a year and a half . and forget about way cool blue , that energy - sucking vampire light . most difficult for me was giving up on aesthetics . my gw700 came with a black metal band , a low profile round case , a black display , and a raised cool blue metal face guard . the 5600e ain ' t changed in years : grey display , black display numbers and letters , ultra - thin low - profie rectangular box shape , and too many print sizes and colors cluttering up the display , making for an ugly grandfather when seen next to the gw700 . but it works . reliably . on and off the pitch . i don ' t need a piece of art on my wrist . i need a watch with a stopwatch function that works under any conditions . 
what kind i say what hasn ' t been said before ? its a great watch that does just that , tell you time and date . i personally like the square design of the watch and i have seen them around a lot . i find myself reaching for this watch more than my automatic watches . the strap is comfortable and overall its light on the wrist . would highly recommend for someone looking for a basic no frills watch . 
i have two other g ' s and this is by far my favorite , i like the simplicity / functionality . i ' ve been wearing it to work for about 8 months and in that time it has withstood heat ( over 200 deg . ) , dust , water and generally getting beat and banged around and it has so far done great . 
my only watch and i love it . it ' s at a great price and it looks great , plus its a g - shock so it looks fashionable . 
i already have a g - shock with atomic timing and solar power , but i really just like number display ( i don ' t like the clock - arm style of my current one ) , so i gave this one a try . it was disappointing soon after i open the package , since the materials ( including the metal knuckle , the plastic band and the metal back ) all feel inferior at least one level to my old g - shock . it actually feels more like the $ 13 casio watch i bought for my little cousin . i am happy the size and look , but the construction makes me wonder whether it will last . 
although it is highly doubtful you are still reading this , i felt like i should review it anyway . i agree with the reviews that say this watch has everything a watch should , and nothing it shouldn ' t . i think that is true , if it were 1985 . but it is not 1985 any more . i ' ll start with the bad things first : a ) this model , with the e suffix , is not solar powered . this means that eventually , the battery is going to die and need to be replaced . when that happens you need to change it . on one hand , the back is easy to get off . just get out your jeweler ' s screwdrivers and remove the four screws . if you are not coordinated with tiny parts , don ' t try it . once the back is off , the seal is broken . there is an o - ring between the stainless steel back and the chassis . it is a challenge to make sure that o - ring is back in the same spot . also , since the cr2016 lithium battery is pretty big and the watch electronics so efficient , the battery lasts a long time . mine lasted 8 years , though i don ' t wear it every day . with daily wear , it would probably be more like 5 years . b ) next problem . . . . oh wait , there are no other problems . the watch is flawless aside from that . the fact that it uses a conventional lithium battery and not solar , coupled with the fact that it is not atomic , means that this watch can be sold for a very fair price . what you get for the price is amazing : a ) ruggedness - this was the original rugged digital watch . before this came out , the only way to have a rugged watch was to buy a diver ' s watch . those were not as rugged as this , nor as affordable . unlike cheaper and less armored models , this model has a mineral glass crystal that is not as easily scratched as the plastic crystal on the cheaper models . also , the g - shock has the rubber armor that protects the crystal from glancing blows . in addition to that , it is 200 m water resistant . this is enough to go swimming with , and even scuba diving . no need to ever take this watch off ! b ) accuracy - i believe the spec . for this watch is 30s per month . mine is more accurate than this . it is so accurate , it only needs to be set once a year . no need for atomic receivers to add cost . c ) features - it has just the right amount of features . the time & calendar are all visible on the main screen ; most of the time i don ' t even need to press any buttons . stopwatch , for those times when i want to time something . how long does it take to ride my bike to the train station ? how long before my food is served when i eat out ? the countdown timer is even more useful . i use it to remind myself to change laundry and for portable cook times for steak on the grill . dual time . came in handy when i was in poland early this year . one alarm , but it is a very special alarm . you can set it to go off every day at a certain time or on a certain day every month , or on a certain day in a certain month . d ) not too clunky - a lot of the newer g - shocks are much thicker and with more corners and edges . this one is big , but it still fits under shirt sleeves . my other g - shock ( the first solar / atomic model ) is probably 20 % bigger . it has a couple of useless features and cost twice as much . e ) comfort - although it has the typical casio resin strap , it is comfortable and it doesn ' t break . the strap is already molded in the shape of of your wrist . this is good , because it means the strap is not getting bent again and again every time you put on or take off the watch . this feature is common to all g - shocks . lesser casios don ' t have this and folks say that the watches themselves last forever , but the straps do not . casio needs to get on board with nylon straps , i think . although solar / atomic is not a required feature , they make this same watch style in a solar / atomic version . it costs more , but i think it is worth it just so that one doesn ' t have to worry about breaking the seal to replace the battery and not getting it back right . technically , one is supposed to replace that gasket and clean it every time the battery is changed . but no one ever does , except casio . if you can afford it , get the solar / atomic model , unless you really want the original ! 
( updated 8 / 2013 ) amazing watch ! i was thinking about how tough , light , and perfect this watch was the other day after i was finished with an appointment in my dress clothes . . . and thinking back to the weekend when i abused this watch repeatedly with action sports , bug sprays , paint thinner ( after getting some overspray paint on it , had to clean it up ) and just all manner of dust , mud , swimming , etc . . . . just a ' normal weekend ' for me . . . and this great watch . it still looks brand new . it ' s classy and refined in a boardroom and tough as nails in the outdoors , i just love it . i will probably buy myself a backup . . . but it hasn ' t come off my wrist in 8 months . . . and i doubt it will in 8 years ! i just love the fact that everying i need is on one screen and a simple light for the dark . i don ' t use anyting but the main screen i ' ve found out . . . but the time , date , and day is essential to me filling out various financial forms . . . and this unit has it all - right there one the main screen . i ' m very happy with this watch . i can ' t say enough good things about the watch and the great reviews here on amazon about it . it ' s all i need and nothing i don ' t . i came off slightly over 5 years of constantly wearing an " outdoor computer " watch on my wrist . . . really big - had alti , compass , baro , temp , gobs of alarms , timers , and settings . . . . i barely used any of them . . . and now with iphones , i can easily get most of those features as apps . . . . if i ever really needed them . what this watch is . . . is a nice change i didn ' t know i really needed . i like that it fits under my shirt sleeve and suit jacket sleeve better . it ' s as tough as they come , and i ' ve been able to use it shooting all day , banging around woods and campsites , using the chainsaw and maul for firewood . . . you name it . . . it ' s been perfect . i like the night - light feature , mine is a green shade , very easy to see . . . and i love that the day , date , and time are what is displayed on the home screen ( all i ' ve ever used - all i need . ) this watch is perfect from the backyard swimming pool to a boardroom presentation . which is perfect since i never , ever take off my watch anyway . 
it will last a life time and endure punishment you can ' t imagine . it is solid , tough , and the display is not cluttered with useless graphs and dials and other nonsense . it is not solar or atomic ( thank goodness ) and it don ' t need to be . it is the only g shock you will ever need . 
classic g with the rectangular face . very retro . this watch tells time and it ' s tough . good first watch for a kid or to use as a disposable travel watch . wear it to the beach , to the pool or out on a tough - mudder run . if it lasts , you ' ll know what time it is . if it breaks ( and it probably won ' t ) get a new one . can ' t go wrong . 
i love casio g - shock watches , they look fantastic and are well made . i decide for this model because it is classic , not to big . 
casio makes great watches . i grew up with casio . this g - shock can take anything you throw at it and even more . it wears great on the wrist . there is a lot to say , so all i can say if you grew up with casio g - shocks then you will know how great casio is . 
pretty much say ' s it all . this watch simply gets the job done . need a tough as nails everyday watch ? look no further here it is . buy it ! don ' t waste money on fancier atomic or solar one . for two to three times the price you can just pitch this in 2 years when the battery goes and get a new one . its accurate enough . if you need more accuracy you may need to up your ocd meds ! 
if you are looking for a cheaper beater watch , this is it . i use this as my fishing watch and has been perfect so far . it still looks as good as the day i bought it too . for the price , it cant be beat . 
i ' m a watch nut . i have about 60 and this one is probably my favorite . very well made , nice materials . a bigger watch for my smaller wrists - but not too big . really just about the perfect size . it ' s also a wide watch and sits higher on the wrist but imo not too high - just about right . bright and easy to read display - lots of functions . big button for the light ( the gray g button under the face ) right on the face which works great and is very bright . easy to set - didn ' t even need to look at the instructions . good looking - rugged g - shock that does it all at a fantastic price . highly recommended . 
i ' ve been wearing these g - shocks since they came out and i love them . they ' re durable , reliable and affordable . this one is my favorite model and i can attest to it ' s a fore - mentioned qualities . i would take one of these over an expensive swiss watch any day . there ' s just about nothing bad to say about it except that it is sort of plain and bulky so you probably don ' t want to wear it out on a date if you ' re trying to impress . fantastic watch and good price on amazon ! 
5 stars cause it ' s really cool , was all i expected , fits great and its comfortable . i definitely would recommend it . 
love this watch . it is a workhorse . very durable and will last a long time . the price was great too . plus , i love the look of this watch on my arm . buy it esp . if you are an exercise junkie like me . you will love this watch . 
i currently have 8 g shocks in my collection . this one is cool just because it ' s simple . the classic 6900 has no solar , no atomic , no 5 alarm settings , alti - thermo & no baro either . it ' s just a cool tough watch . big , bold & straight to the point . some claim that this is a mall type fake g . do some research & you will find that this is 100 % real . awesome value . 
i purchased the g - shock as a gift for my son who is a big believer in punctuality . the watch is accurate to 5 seconds a month in my experience . he set his to my casio pathfinder which syncs with the atomic clock and was one second off after 3 weeks . i think that speaks to the accuracy . a good watch especially for the money . 
i had this watch when i was a kid , the only downside is that the quality of the belt is not the same as it was years ago , keep the quality casio , you have there a great and classic watch ! 
it ' s hard to begin a review about an item that i love so much . if you would like the history of the g - shock brand that begins all the way back from 1983 , here ' s the official link : [ . . . ] now , about this specific model the dw6900 - 1v is a model that has been around since the early 2000 ' s and is considered to be an entry level unit in the g - shock family of products . here are the official specs from the casio website : shock resistant200 meter water resistantel backlight with afterglowflash alertflashes with buzzer that sounds for alarms , hourly time signal , countdown timer time - up alarm1 / 100 second stopwatchmeasuring capacity : 00 & # 8217 ; 00 & # 8221 ; 00 - 59 & # 8217 ; 59 & # 8221 ; 99 ( for the first 60 minutes ) 1 : 00 & # 8217 ; 00 - 23 : 59 & # 8217 ; 59 ( after 60 minutes ) measuring unit : 1 / 100 second ( for the first 60 minutes ) 1 second ( after 60 minutes ) measuring mode : elapsed time , split time , 1st - 2nd place timescountdown timermeasuring unit : 1 secondcountdown range : 24 hourscountdown start time setting range : 1 second to 24 hours ( 1 - second increments , 1 - minute increments and 1 - hour increments ) other : auto - repeatmulti - function alarmhourly time signalfull auto - calendar ( pre - programmed until the year 2039 ) 12 / 24 hour formatsaccuracy : + / - 15 seconds per monthbattery cr2016approx . battery life : 2 yearsmodule 1289 / 3230i have always been the guy that never wanted to spend a ton of money on a watch . part of the reason is because i have a job where my watch was prone to constant damage and bruising . so like many folks i would go to walmart and pickup a 15 dollar watch every year . i was going through watches at about that rate . until about 2 years ago i saw a ups driver wearing a g - shock watch ( not the dw6900 , but a different model ) . he went on to tell me all about the watch and how much he loved everything about it . from the design , to how well it fits on his wrist , but the most important aspect of all which is how durable , touch , and well built the watch is . so after listening to him , i decided to purchase this g - shock and have never looked back . everything about this watch is amazing . simple in functions compared to more upscale g - shocks , but for me that ' s a plus . i don ' t need to know sea levels or faces of the moon . i just need a timer for daily tasks and a chronometer for exercise . plus this watch has a fantastic feature that many digital watches no longer have , even the upscale time pieces : the feature is that no matter which watch mode you are in , the time is always displayed on the upper right portion of the screen . this may seem small in importance , but believe me when you get started using the watch you will wonder how you managed without the function in the first place . it makes it so convenient to not have to switch between modes just to know what time is it . i find it very strange how this function is not available on most digital watches now . . . the only two minor complaints that i have about this watch are : 1 - ) if you have small wrists you may prefer the smaller model 5600 which is the all time classic still available , and fits much better on smaller wrists . 2 - ) the " g " imprint on the light button is not colored . . . again this is a small dislike that to others may not think it is . in my opinion casio could have colored it red for an extra 3 cents on the cost of the watch if that . . . to wrap up the review , for the price of this watch there is no better watch out there . this watch will go through hell and back with you . you may not be as tough as this watch is . it is standard issue for many military and law enforcement agencies around the world . here ' s a link to google pictures of military units wearing g - shocks all over the world , thanks : [ . . . ] 
this watch has made history around the world , everybody has a master time piece like this , in one word it is part of the human culture 
this watch does exactly what i need it to and didn ' t cost a fortune . i got it on sale during the holidays and i think it is a very attractive watch . it has your basic features necessary for law enforcement use . 
the g shock is a great watch for active people . i ' ve worn mine while surfing , skiing , mountain biking , racquetball , golf , running , skating . . . you name it . it ' s practically indestructible . i remember the early g shock commercials when they would strap one to a hockey puck then slap shot it into the net . . . . still worked . this watch is especially handy when out in remote areas with no cell service . 
i thought the watch arrived damaged , but apparently there is one knob that is supposed to be " in " more than the others . my son is very happy with the watch . 
i saw a lot of good reviews . i didn ' t expect much after getting another 140 dollar one . this watch is awesome for the price . love it . perfect size . 
ok people . . . . lookee here . . . watch arrived in two days . prime has it ' s priviledges . it was factory packed . no hand me down no returned item pawned off on me . . . brand spanking new . i have used this watch for diving up to 100 feet for years . it never leaked . if you have the battery changed though and submerge it into the ole h2o it ' s toast . henceforth which is how the previous one met it ' s demise . i decided to get the same model and paid less for it then i paid 10 years ago . one more thing , i heard if you let casio change the battery they claim it will once again be 200 meter water - resistant . i like this watch because of the little wheel gizmo ' s . i don ' t know exactly what they do but it is impressive . i mainly use the timer when diving and it is easy to read and when engaged a nice light blue back light called the " illuminator " comes on and will light up your life . 
i collect g - shock watches and this classic model is in my collection . so far i haven ' t had any issues with any of my g - shock watches . this is the basic classic style watch with all the functionality of the newer limited edition models . i recommend it if your looking for a daily wear durable watch . 
que tremendo reloj , todas las funciones que trae son buenisimas y funcionan al 100 % , lo recomiendo a las personas de buen gusto . casio 1005 original . . . 
great watch . great features . handles rough treatment very well . able to wash car with it with no problems . good watch for a very active type person . good on the jogging trail and basketball court . 
this g - shock from casio is by far the best bargin priced watch offered by amazon . at $ 45 plus free super saver shipping from amazon , it ' s a steal . this newer g - shock and others like it , have the better resin bands that fit my wrist better , and don ' t leave extra strap hanging out like my older g - shocks . all in all , a everyday g - shock that i wear either walking my dog or hitting the mountain bike trails . . . . 
pros : > up close , it is well finished and looks great . it does not look cheap , but appears well made and well assembled . as they say in the garment industry , it " gives good hand . " > it is easy to see and easy to use . > it ' s a good size . i wanted a bigger watch , and it is that . > it ' s a great value , delivering the big g - shock look and feel for only a few bucks more than cheapo plastic watches that break . cons : > the digits on the main time display are small , particularly when considering the size of the whole face . overall , i am very pleased . the watch is what the description says it is , and its look and feel in real life exceed the pictures on amazon . it is too new for me to comment on its durability , but many other reviewers have that covered . 
got this watch 2 days ago . this is my first g - shock ever . it looks great and durable but the display is too small for my eyes w / o glasses . i ' m going back to my old casio analog illuminator . . 
i like this watch and to me it ' s classic g - shock . the only thing i don ' t like is that the band isn ' t as wide as on some of my other g - shocks . the clasp is black , which i like . overall , i like this watch and it ' s priced right on amazon . 
as a watch " nut " i can testify to the quality of this g . i have owned , traded , and collected dozens of watches . i don ' t want or need atomic , solar , and other nonsense . this dw - 6900 is a mans watch and will go through any scenario you can imagine . i have had g ' s with atomic , solar , baro , alti , you name it . . . . but the more functions you have crammed into a module , the more you have that might go wrong . this is a working man ' s watch . good as they get . battle worthy . strap it on and forget it . 
i should have bought this model in the beginning . i needed a replacement for a g - shock i ' ve had for 10 years . . . . had to sell it because i needed the quick cash , bought an analog / digital casio , which didn ' t last the first week of use . i then realized how much i can ' t stand analog watches . i found this model and has all the features i needed and i do expect it to last and endure the same abuse the previous g - shock provided . 
i reviewed another g - shock because my cousin in the army used it and loves it . this one is the quintessential tough watch . they ' re sold at pxs , cheap , yet durable and very accurate while providing some great other functions while leaving a few off that are also great but not really needed . i ' ve had mine for only a year now but i ' m kicking its butt working around my house doing upkeep , updates , and throwing in camping every now and then . get this watch , it ' s a bit clunky but not meant to be a dress watch . you won ' t regret it . 
cant beat casio for their products toughness when it comes to these watches . perfect for several occassions . they will last forever . 
i bought it to my sonhe likes it very muchit is simple - no need for show off - and very strong and it can be used for scuba divinggood value for the money 
arrived in time . the casing is not what is shown on the description page . the watch lives up to its reputation ( strong , sturdy g shock ) . the internal lightening is very good with equal distribution across all the surface . must have for the price at which it is available on amazon ( excellent value of money ) . 
nice product and a great price but was a little to small for my wrist so i had to send it back 
i got it on ebay for about 30 dollars . i like the build quality and the look for sure . i has good features , everything i need . only complaint i have is the embedded buttons . i have to really push my finger in there to press the buttons . that ' s all though , nothing big , just a little extra effort . 
le compr & eacute ; este reloj a mi hijo de 7 a & ntilde ; os , el cual le queda un poquito grande , pero es perfecto por que su caracteristica de resistencia contra los impactos y dise & ntilde ; o simple le ha permitido adaptarse mucho mejor en sus compromisos . la principal caracteristica de su dise & ntilde ; o es para resistir impactos , pero el display lo dejaron algo peque & ntilde ; o , sin embargo no es un inconveniente . 
i ' ve had the casio dw9052 g - shock watch for a couple of months now . so far its held up very well . there is nothing real fancy about it . it shows the time / date , illuminates and has a stop watch . not much else but for around $ 50 what do expect . now , i haven ' t pounded on the thing with a sledge hammer but it seems like it could take a beating . its a comfortable watch being not too big or small . it is a little thick so if you have little girly wrists it may look a little funny . for the price tag i would recommend it if you are looking a nice , sporty watch that won ' t break the bank . 
i was looking for a decent watch that i could take out kayaking with me and not worry about it getting wet . this has worked fine so far . 
i purchased a model dw - 5600e with module 1545 in feb 1997 for use while crew on a sailing ship . the primary reason i chose this watch was its slim design . i needed to be able to fit the watch inside a tight sleeved jacket . the paperwork that came with it said the battery should last about 2 years with normal use . i have been wearing this watch for the past 13 years , using the backlight sparingly . in addition to being captain and crew on sailing vessels , i am also in the landscape construction business . although i don ' t think it has ever been completely submerged , this watch has been subjected to violent storms at sea , being dropped from extreme heights , burying in the mud , and various other abuses over the years . it is still running on the original battery . i did replace the band about 6 years ago after it got brittle and broke . i paid only $ 25 for it back then , so that works out to less than $ 2 per year . best bargain i ' ve ever had . 
i like this g shock . i have owned several different g shock watches over the years and they have withstood a fair amount of abuse ala working on the house and some sports . this particular model is a moderate size , looks rugged , and has a good backlight . it tracks the seconds via a lcd bar and circle that makes the face a bit mor entertaining than a regular second count . my only complaint would be the cramped appearance of the face layout , but it is still easily readable . 
have had many good casio watches . even the $ 20 watches are great . however , when i received this watch the digital display is too faint . in order to read it it clearly , i have to turn the watch to the side . perhaps it languished in a warehouse too long and battery is dying . will send it back and try to get refund . had the display been better i would have kept this watch and probably given it a good review . update 9 . 18 . 11 : i sent watch back to seller who credited my credit card with purchase amount and shipping . i have since bought another g - shock on amazon and am awaiting its arrival . 
i just got my new dw9052 - 1v in the mail today . the pictures online don ' t do the watch any justice . i opened the package and was shocked to see such an awesome time piece for around $ 40 . the watch is big , bulky & tough looking . if it were a piece of bread , it would defiantly be classified under the texas toast variety . suit wearing yuppies need not apply . this thing won ' t fit under your button up shirt sleeve . very happy with my purchase . thanks amazon ! update : i ' ve worn the watch for a day & sadly had to return it . the watch band was very uncomfortable . i have since been wearing my g shock 6900 1v . it feels & fits much better . 2nd update 6 - 4 - 14i repurchased this watch once i got a solution from some amazon responses to my review . the band is interchangeable with the classic g shock 6900 . i purchased a band for around $ 13 . 00 , the fit is awesome . thanks amazon readers / reviewers for the tip . 
i bought this watch for my step daughter , and she loves it . she is very rough , and the watch holds up great for all her activities and sports she is involved in . 
gorgeous watch for the price . looks great and it is just the right size watch for a man . you have to see it to believe it , looks better than the picture . 
bought the mudman for my son and he likes it . easy to read - shock proof - masculine look . now i have to get one for myself . 
a little on the chinese side . it is g shock , in the fake rolex sense . i would give it 4 stars cause the numbers are easy to read . 
this is a great watch i ' m even wearing it as i write this i always like the g shock watches and the way they look 
i collect watches and i bought this one for my son . he loves the watch and never takes it off . this watch has put up with a lot of abuse and it continues to work well and look nice . 
this is the second casio g - shock watch that i ' ve owned . i ' m retired from scuba diving now , but the first g - shock was my everyday watch and dive watch , and i regularly took it as deep as 80 - 90 feet without any problems . after several years , the battery died , and since the watch was getting pretty scratched and beat - up , i ordered a new one , the dw9052 - 1v model . it ' s another keeper , with its ruggedness and great accuracy . and it ' s an impressive - looking watch as well as being so durable . i ' m sold on casio . i ' ve owned four or five casio watches over the last thirty years or so , and every one of them has been just super . the dw9052 - 1v g - shock is no exception . 
love my watch but there is one little thing i dont like about it . the arm band is to small for my wrist . i have to place it on the first or second notch . i just wish i can find a longer band but the watch is so awesome . 
i had this watch for a year , and let me tell you it is the toughest watch i have ever owned . i put it through camping trips , car repair , oil and paint spills , dropped from a 2 story building . got sandwiched between closing doors , hit by car doors and scrapped through a street floor . and guess what ! ! this bad boy is still cooking ! ! what a remarkable watch ! so strong and well made . you buy a g shock and you have a watch for life . the only complaint i have about this watch is that it is too bulky , too big for my small wrists . if you have small wrists , i recommend the classic 5600 or 6900 series g shocks . which is what i have now and they fit much better on smaller wrists . 
i bought this watch for my brother . when it arrived , i was pleasantly surprised . i like the size and it looks good ! 
amazing rugged , very accurate , but most importantly . . . one of the most comfortable g shock watches to wear . this comfort is do the band which is different from most g shocks . i only wish that casio offered more models with this type of band . if you have ever wished for a g shock that fits like a regular watch then this model is the model for you . 
gave this to my teenage son . the features are just as expected . it works great and he ' s happy with it . i liked the price so if he loses it or destroys it somehow , it ' s not that big of a deal . 
g - shock is a great watch for anyone ! i gave it as a gift and who received it loved it ! ! everybody loves a g - shock ! ! ! i have a few of them ! ! 
casio es calidad relojes de bajo precio y una gran duraci & oacute ; n este no es la excepci & oacute ; n cuenta con funciones basicas resistente al agua dise & ntilde ; o moderno que puede ser usado a diario y un buen precio 
i needed a watch for a beach vacation that would be durable enough to wear in the water , cheap enough so i wouldn ' t worry about it , and attractive enough to wear all the time . this watch is perfect for my needs . it ' s shock resistant ( of course ! ) , waterproof and inexpensive . i set the time in just a few seconds after i unwrapped it . it ' s easy to set . the alarm function should be useful for traveling . the numbers that indicate time are smallish . the dial is normally sized for a modern watch but the numbers for date and time take up only a small portion of the available room . instead , casio , oddly , places a revolving second wheel and a seconds indication bar in the middle of the dial . i took my glasses off and the time was still large enough to be legible , so i ' m pleased . the button that lights up the display is large and placed at the bottom center of the watch . this is good because you would normally be using this at night . the watch is not large enough to get in the way , but it is thick . it feels as if it extends about a half inch above your wrist . 
received this as a gift and it is a major upgrade from my previous casio watch . i have had no problems at all with any of the functions of the watch , it has survived already lots of time in the water and trips to the gym . i love the second counter display , the light is bright enough and it is just heavy enough to have a decent weight . great watch overall . band is also very comfortable . 
excelente reloj , 100 % original muy es muy elegante , lo recomiendo a las persinas de buen gusto y bestir , es tal cual como lo describe el vendedor , y llego en el tiempo estimado . 
i bought this because i have so many quartz watches i wanted a cool digital one wand this one looked great . i like the illumination on this and so does my son , when i wear it he tends to press that button 
i have had this watch for 6 months and it still looks new . i wear it everywhere and it has been thru hot summers in the pool and cold winters in the snow . the glo light is bright easy to see when pitch dark and the numbers are easy to read in all lights . i will buy again . 
great watch for an active person . handles rough treatment very well . handles water very well so far , keeps good time , has goo features like stopwatch , timer etc . seems to be good for all type of outdoor activities . 
this watch is great . attractive , easy to use , nice price . what ' s not to like ? ? very pleased . if you ' re wondering whether to get this , just get . you ' ll be pleased . ok - i ' m revisiting my review . the watch conked out after a little over a year . i changed the battery but the connection somewhere is shaky and it ' s time to replace this . i had expected it to last much longer . under the circumstances i ' ll generously give this a 3 . 
got this watch for my brother for christmas and he loves it . it fits really nice and it looks good 
this is a replacement of the same model i had for 10 years . the plastic body of the watch started to break off in chunks and eventually the internals of the watch were exposed and well you guess the rest . i was abusive to the watch , taken it in extreme high and low temperature environments , moist environments , went swimming with it on . it ' s been hit by walls , doors , the ground , trees ( all unintentionally of course ) but it withstood all that abuse for 10 years . so i went on amazon and found it to be very reasonably priced since i don ' t have the budget for the military models . this watch has the features i need and is of great quality . i recommend it . 
it is much cheaper than we buy here in australia . my son put it on when it arrived and ever since then he wears it everyday to school . 
good looking , both analog and digital , but the digital part is quite difficult to read . the clasp is nice as well , although the bracelet doesn ' t fold on itself , so it always holds a circular shape even when it ' s sitting on the table . pretty good all around . 
the watch is good , i like the design , but the light is not strong and does not look good when night or in dark places , but it ' s good brand and design . 
i rate the watch at 5 stars for the accuracy as well as size and appearance . a lot of compliments from friends that have never owned a casio but are now considering a purchase . you won ' t regret buying this fine watch ! ! 
i ' ve bought and had several watched but this one ads nice function and style . its a little bit weird how the strap won ' t fold flat but the watch is amazing . ok so temperature seems a little off but i cant be for sure because i don ' t have a thermometer just a thermostat . world time zones works great for me and the text can be difficult to read but it works fine for me . the auto illuminator is a nice feature as well . be sure to buy a watch link remover to size it just right for yourself . 
i also like the watch . was in a good condition its work so well and i really empress it looks like very expensive when you wear it . it ' s absolutelynice ! ! i have no regrets to choose this watch . thank you . 
i bought this watch as a gift for my brother who specifically wanted a better looking digital watch to wear to work . out of the countless watches i looked at , this casio was the best one ( and it ' s round twin ) under $ 100 . it has most of the desired features in a digital : alarm , stopwatch , timer . it also has a temperature meter but i wonder about it ' s accuracy . in any case , the digital readout is very difficult to see in the light of day . at night , a push of the illumination button makes it easy to see . the band looks ok but is cheap rolled steel with no attempt made to polish / brush the sides to conceal that fact . all in all , a decent watch that stands out in looks compared to other budget digital watches . 
as stated , this is an awesome watch ; its got the looks , is lightweight , and for the most part - - tells time correctly . i ' m not gonna get into all the mumble jumbo but i ' ll briefly state my likes and dislikes . to start off , i needed a watch for outdoor activities , particularly for hiking and this style and model nailed it . loved the overall color - combination from being beige , light brown to dark brown . the letters are bold and the hands are extremely easy to read . it matches very well with my outdoor apparel ( khaki , belt , and hiking boot ) ! but the best part ? i can use it as an everyday casual watch . as much as i like the casio forester , a few flaws has caused my displeasure of owning it . the number one thing that bothers me most is the band . though very versatile but it can also get uncomfortable for several reasons . first of all , it is scratchy on the wrist ! this is mostly caused by the harsh band material and sharp - cut corners of the leather and threading . also , the four little screws underneath the bottom base are the biggest discomfort of all due to their rough edges . perhaps the aforementioned needed to be broken - in ? as for the mechanical part ; the calendar likes to start its day a bit early at 10 to midnight ( 00 : 50pm ) , which means if i look at my watch between 11 : 50 - 55pm , it is already tomorrow ! another thing ; the date setting doesn ' t go in reverse , but only forward . the other small nuisance would be the illuminator light , which only stays on for a split second , or even less until you ' hold on ' to the button , even then it is very dimmed . but hey , for $ 14 ( ships from and sold by amazon . com ) i shouldn ' t be throwing a hissy - fit . but all in all , i like the watch . we ' ll see how the plastic housing hold up through time . 
today i received my ordered item casio men ' s ft500wv - 5bv forester electro - luminescent analog sport watch . . . thanks . . . very nice product . . . best quality . . . i ' ll recommend it to my friends . . . 
i got this watch at walmart stores at $ 20 bucks . it was a steal at this price . pros1 . good looking watch . 2 . very light weight , you wont feel that you wearing it . 3 . velcro band is good and durable . 4 . the face of the watch clearly shows the time and date . 5 . the colors of the face and the strap go well with each other . 6 . the night time glow is good and time can be read in absolute darkness as well . cons1 . feels little delicateoverall , its an excellent watch and a good buy . thanks amazon . 
it looks really nice in the photos , but in real life it is rather cheap . the plastic where the band connects seems like it will break . the worst part is the stiffness of the velcro band . it doesn ' t lie flat around your arm . it is convoluted instead of a real circle . 
i got 1 for myself and another for my son ( 9yrs old ) and they are terrific ! where the " 3 " should be it has a window for the date , ( number only ) . i love everything about it ! and you can skip ahead if the month doesnt have 31 days . 
got it as a graduation gift for my son ' s friends . stylish and dependable ; feels and looks more expensive than it really is . 
i spent ten minutes or around to adjust the bracelet , fortunately , i made it . you have to lift the lock with a little hole up , and use the screwdriver to push the little bump in the hole the same direction of the arrow and you can pull out the whole pin . you need to repeat the same procedure on the neibouring lock and then you can remove one chain . the watch looks cute , hope it can last long . 
i have gotten very interested in watches and have this one with a white face . i liked the look of this one in the photo and i wasn ' t disappointed . i have to have a couple of links taken out because my wrist is small but it looks great . it looks way more expensive than it really is . i love the black face because i wear a lot of black and a lot of silver jewelry and this compliments them well . my engagement ring is platinum and the watches look great with it . i just may order another one with a different color face ! 
the price was so low that i wasn ' t expecting much but i was surprised how nice it is . i wear it nearly every day and it still looks brand new . 
i wanted a stainless steel watch with a black face , and this one looked lovely for the price . my husband had a casio many years ago that lasted just about forever , so i decided to give it a try . the watch is beautiful , and i ' m glad i decided to buy it . it ' s lovely and understated and is very attractive . i do have to get used to reading it where there are no numbers on the rectangular dial , but i ' m sure i ' ll be just fine ! i would definitely recommend this watch at this price , although the band on mine seems to be shorter than other reviewers reported . additional links for the band on this watch are not available from casio . 
i was really surprised to find a casio watch available for such a low price but amazon always has the lowest prices around . the watch is stylish and exactly the right size for me . it isn ' t overly large or covered in sparkly things . it ' s just a simple watch on a silver band which is exactly what i wanted . i have worn it every day since receiving it and have not had any problems at all . several people have complimented me and asked where i got it which is always nice . the clasp seems to be quite secure which i really like . my old watch had a clasp that was always coming apart so it dropped off my wrist on many occasions . if you don ' t like a loose watch , you will probably need to have a link or two removed because it is loose on my wrist but i happen to like my watch a bit loose . overall , this watch is a great value and i would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone . 
love the watch . just wish that it came with an additional link . 
as always the brand casio cheap watches , high quality , comfortable , economical and elegant . my mother and my mother were happy to receive this gift . 
i ' ve bought this watch for my wife and she loved it . it ' s small , stylish , works well and looks great . by the way , the price is awesome . great purchase 
this item is good . neatly and securely packaged . it worths buying it and is good for a loved one . i will recommend for people who want to surprise lovers and friends on occasions . 
reloj muy elegante para cualquier ocasion lo recomiendo muy comodo y bonito . . . . . . . . . 
i was looking for an everyday watch and this is the one ! i like the black face against the silver and the classic bracelet style . you cannot beat the price . very happy with the watch . 
i was looking for a stainless watch and didnt want to spend much . saw this watch and ordered it , thinking id use it till i find a better one . turns out - its great . its lightweight and easy to read . it looks like a much more expensive watch . cant beat the price . 
this is a nice watch but be prepared to go by a good jeweler to work magic ! this watch was like a swing on my hand and i still have not been able to get the band adjusted because one jeweler said that the links are like welded on so its cant be adjusted , i just put in a box , what a waste ! don ' t buy this unless u have real fat or big wrist 
i brought this watch for a friend she loved it . the quality is great , the size , everything is perfect about this watch and of course the price . i have one myself and it is the most worn watch in all of my watches . 
stars are base on the price and appearance of the product . my secretary likes a lot this watchyes , i recommend this watch for a daily use 
it ' s been quite a while i have purchased this watch and i love it . it ' s with me almost every day . it ' s a bit too big but could fix it easily with the help of a specialist . the head of the watch is just the right size for smaller hands and i love it ' s overall appearance and the way it works . 
i love it , bought this watch for my dear friend and i ' m so glad she likes it . . . bought another one for my sister too . . . 
my new watch is wonderful - now that i got the watch band adjusted . i have a small wrist and the normal adjustments weren ' t enough . i contacted casio and they sent me instructions for removing links . fortunately for me i have a talented husband who was finally able to figure it out and remove the links to make it fit . i can ' t read the time as easily as i thought i would be able to . the black face makes it a little difficult . but for the money - it is a great little watch ! 
had bought my wife one of these in many years ago , and the battery died recently . rather than pay someone to replace the battery , bought a new one in black . and ended up replacing the battery myself on the old one too . . . . great value ! 
very nice i gift it to my mother she like it very much and like it thank you i will order more 
i gave this to my wife for christmas and she really liked it . it ' s a perfect size and keeps good time . can ' t go wrong for the price and quality . 
i was so dissappointed to see how cheap this watch looks after it arrived . i have worn it only once and will probably give it away . if you do not adjust the band to fit the watch will spin around your wrist as the watch itself is top heavy . the watch stem looked tarnished when it arrived and the band is very dull . i have seen $ 10 watches at wal mart that are better looking . 
this was a last minute christmas gift for my mother in law . it arived quickly thanks to amazon prime . it ' s smaller than it looks on the picture but beautiful and sturdy , looks great on hand and goes with everything , both elegant blouses and simple sweaters . very happy with the purchase . 
love this watch . it ' s not fancy , but for the price you can ' t get much better . it goes with just about any outfit too . 
between my hands - on job involving solvents and my toddler , i can ' t wear pricey watches anymore and was looking for a cheap , reliable replacement . i normally go to timex for my every - day watch but after my last one broke , i decided to give this casio watch a try . i ' m happy to say it looks very nice and stylish - i particularly like the sleekness of this watch which seems to make my forearms look slimmer . the strap is comfortable , the watch is water - resistant ( at least so far ! ) and it tells the time accurately . for myself , that ' s all i need in a watch at the moment so this has worked very well for me . 
quite a disappointment , although i will say some of the problems may be my own fault . i didn ' t read the description carefully enough , and didn ' t choose well . eventually i found paying to have my old watch repaired was more worthwhile . 
i can ' t believe some of the lukewarm reviews this watch has gotten , what do you mean " ok for a $ 10 watch ? " this is a terrific watch for under $ 10 . the band which is black plastic is pliable and has so many closely placed holes on it that i had no worries about the arm sweat that some other plastic bands can create . very comfortable . the face of the watch is large , not too large to look too masculine , clear and so easy to read . why anyone would want to spend $ 50 to $ 100 for some designer watch is beyond me . this is a real ladies watch for real ladies , at home , at work , on the go , this is an unbeatable value for a everyday watch . 
got one for my mom who likes outdoor stuff but wears a dress watch . it ' s cheap , durable ( casio ) and very readable ( she ' s in her 70s ) . plus , it ' s the lightest watch i ' ve ever picked up , hard to go wrong with this one . 
this watch is practical and easy to read . i bought it for that reason and it works perfectly for a watch to just tell one what time it is without all the gizmos . 
excellent watch my wife likes me , is very durable and beautiful , thanks to its size can easily read the time is very comfortable , practical and waterproof 
i have to give this watch 5 stars because i love it - - except for one thing - - the hands are silver . i would have liked them to be black . i work mostly in low light conditions so they aren ' t so easy to read quickly . but other than that i love it . it ' s a work watch and that ' s what i wanted . it has a great foot print , big enough to see but not & # 34 ; fat & # 34 ; - - doesn ' t get caught up on things . i really like the strap . the piece that holds down the end looks like it will last the lifetime of the watch - that ' s the part that always fails on the watches that i use . but if casio could just make the hands black . . . 
the watch is great for my mom . the numbers are big and clear and she can see the time clearly . band easily adusts to her wrist , so i don ' t have to take out links , etc . 
i bought this for my 9 yr . old son . light weight and easy to read . fits him well and he has become much better at reading the time . very satisfied with this purchase ! 
this is an inexpensive watch , but it suits my needs for daily wear . the face of the watch is nice and easy to read . i like that . the band is an inexpensive plastic - kind of material . the band doesn ' t cause me to sweat like other inexpensive ( plastic ) watches i ' ve had , so that is a bonus . seems to keep good time . i ' ve only had it about a week . 
this is just what i was looking for . a watch that i can read for a price i can afford . 
didn ' t really like this watch as it was too cheap looking and not the size i expected . i sold it to a friend . 
the thin silver hands blend into the background so the time is hard to read in dim light . getting it wet is not a problem and the plastic band fits / is comfortable . so far it keeps good time and for the price i can ' t really complain . 
i bought this cause i wanted a cheap watch i can wear for exercise walking . i had bought a handful of those big - face jelly watches in assorted colors to go with my sports tops . but those watches are kinda heavy , though easy to read . i decided to try and find a lighter watch for the same purpose and found this one on amazon - - cheap , simple color ( can wear with any of my exercise clothes - - and it looked like my middle aged eyes could see the time without glasses ( as i don ' t wanna haul readers along with me on my 30 minute walks ) . this has a second hand that ' s really fine / thin , so very hard to see with presbyopia . but . . i can barely make it out . so , to take one ' s pulse , this works , too , to make sure one is in the aerobic zone . for me , it ' s about being useful , readable , and cheap . utilitarian . lightweight . lies nicely flat against the wrist . not clunky ugly like those rhinestone encrusted jelly watches that cost a bit more . will update if quality is total pits . : ) enjoy . . . 
i kept checking my cell phone for the latest time , however i still use a clamshell style and would leave it in whatever room i wasn ' t . finally caved and looked for an affordable and easy - to - read watch and this casio is amazing . the 1 & # 34 ; diameter face gives you the right time at a glance and its so lightweight you don ' t feel it on your wrist . the price is unbeatable . 
i bought this watch for my mom who wanted something with large numbers . the size of the watch was bigger than expected . otherwise its an excellent product . 
i ' m a nurse with old eyes , my only complaint about this watch is that the second hand is hard to see if you don ' t hold the watch just right , even with my glasses on . i bought it for work use and have been using it , but it ' s been frustrating so i ' m replacing it . it was inexpensive and otherwise is a good value . i ' ll use it for non - work purposes . 
i purchased this to wear while i ' m over in europe , however since i ' ve been wearing it since i received it and really like it as an everyday watch . i like the large display and the white background . i have a very very small wrist , and i can report that it fits fine with 3 more notches to spare out of 11 . i recommend this watch for day to day wearing as the face doesn ' t look too cheap or anything , and looks a lot better than the product image . 
basic watch to tell time . . . nothing to write home about . easy to read the numerials . light weight . ok for everyday use . looks plasticky . 
my husband as been a wearer of casio watches since high school . . . over 25 years ago ! they are amazing watches and over time we feel that the quality is still the same . . . wonderful ! this watch was no exception . it is well made and arrived in a casio box and then inside another box . it was running when he received it and is still going strong ! naturally , the bands are the same as ever and i am sure the watch band will break / die way before the watch does , but for the price you can not go wrong . oh , and as for the large digital numbers . . . hubby can read them w / out wearing his glasses . lol ! great item ! 
she bought it at a local big box k store on sale for $ 15 or so . i set it for her to real atomic time . i just got my kids watches for christmas and set theirs to atomic time . i decided , & # 34 ; i ' ll go set the wife ' s watch also & # 34 ; . . i got it and it was only 1 second slow after 8 months ? whoa ! ! ! she works at a factory building abs brake pumps for cars . it ' s scratched up pretty bad already but only one second off after 8 months . i ' m impressed ! 
i find it easier to just tell the time quickly and free from error , my job situation requires a quicker response . 
i originally bought one of these many years ago for work and it performed very well considering the type of work i do . paid about $ 10 or $ 11 . 00 for it and after about 3 years the band broke . since it ' s not cost effective to replace the band on a $ 10 . watch , i simply bought another one for around $ 13 . 00 a couple of years ago . the 2nd watch and band are still going strong . since i like the watch so much , i just ordered a 3rd one on amazon to be sure i have it if / when the 2nd watch or band fails . pros : keeps good timestopwatch functionwater resistantlong battery life ( i still have the original watch with the broken band and it ' s still running ) cons : cheap band ( but hey , it ' s a $ 15 . 00 watch ) alarm is too quietall - in - all , this watch offers great ' bang for the buck ' ! i recommend it . 
time , alarm , second time zone , stopwatch . it ' s all i need . it ' s so cheap that when the band breaks , it ' s better to just replace the watch . : - ) 
received the watch today feels cheap but it ' s ok , basically for the price of lunch you get something that should serve you for 2 to 3 years , i give it 4 stars out of 5 . you ' ll never have to worry about how expensive a watch you are wearing whether you ' ll damage it or get mugged that ' s for sure . a good product . this is a good watch to wear in a third world country or in an urban environment . i ' ve noticed in the past when i ' m wearing a much much more expensive watch people check it out with ths watch they won ' t take a second look at it which is what i want .

you can ' t beat a cheap casio when working in landscape or construction for a disposable watch . the battery usually lasts longer than the watch survives . even so , they are hard to destroy ; 
a no frills watch that does what it is supposed to do - tell time and tell it accurately - always a dedicated casio owner 
will leak after about a year or less of sea water use . even after soaking in water after each surf session ( made sure to check dial knob was depressed ) , it will not keep this watch from surviving . cold will leak some water into this watch . i bought this cheap and it works for non surf usage so i ' m not rating low but others who rated this to work for water really need to reedit those reviews because i ' m sure they have leaked by now . 
great price and very good quality , my parentslove it , they don ` t take care of a luxury watch so this option was great and the numbers are big nough for them . . . . . 
this watch is small and thin . i keep this watch on the work bench and wear it when working on tasks that my ordinary watch would get in the way . 5 stars for being a value at $ 9 . 
not much to say . does it ' s job . looks just like the picture , description is pretty accurate , and i agree with most of the other top reviews for this item . great deal with the price ! not bad ! 
this watch is lightweight , the face is very readable , and it keeps great time . the price is cheap and so i highly recommend it . 
you get what you pay for . extremly cheap and poorly made watch . looks cheap and poor as well . i ' m actually suprised that it even works . 
all i needed was something that was cheap , not fragile , and would tell me the time . this fit the bill . mine was $ 9 . 35 and was well worth it . i bought it a couple months ago and it is all i could ask for . the band is a flexible resin ( which is essentially thin rubber ) , the casing over the face and hands of the watch is plastic so i don ' t have to be concerned about breaking it on anything , the knob to set the time is easy to maneuver , and it was less than ten dollars . this is a watch that does what it is supposed to , doesn ' t seem like it will break , and even if it does it can be easily replaced . recommended . 
an inexpensive watch that keeps perfect time and looks great . i only like analog watches , and this is a great looking watch . the band is very comfortable too . 
i ordered this as a replacement for a similar watch that i lost . i like an analog watch and especially the white face and clear numbers . the watch is light and thin , great for activities . i highly recommend this watch ! 
i really like this watch . it isn ' t flashy , its very comfortable and it tells great time . i wear it to work it goes with almost anything because it is black and white , it looks elegant if you want it to , and also sporty as well with the band . you can wear this watch with any type of clothes and it fits all occasions . the face isn ' t huge so if you have a big wrist it will look small and might not want it . its a great watch and it works perfectly , really satisfied with it and i am thinking about getting a different model . casio makes a quality quartz watch and this is a classic . 
it is hard to distinguish a significant difference between this watch and the casio - mq247b2 which is fifty cents cheaper , but apparently this one might have a better crystal and band . in any case i replace the band with woven cloth as soon as possible because of irrtitation from sweat . this is definitely the watch to get , once you replace the band . it is clearly visible under nearly any situation and surely beats a digital . find out how much shipping will cost . it coudl raise the price fifty per cent . find out whether they will ship to your address . if it is overseas or a pob ( or even ap ) they may not . but this is the watch to go for rather than any other . if you need a calendar as well , put one on your wall or buy a newspaper . when you need to know the time , you can count on this watch to clearly provide the information you seek . 
it was good for the price for a gift to be given to someone who may be able to appreciate it . 
i ' m returning this watch after only two weeks , but it ' s a watch that ' s worth considering if you want a straightforward , good - looking watch . the reason i ' m returning it is that the main reason i ordered it was that i expected it to be easier to read in low light without glasses than my current black - face analog watch , but to my surprise it isn ' t , mostly because the hands on this watch are thinner . overall , however , this is an easy watch to read . there is one thing i disliked about it is the band . it looks really cheap and doesn ' t do the watch justice . i bought a speidel leather band that would have looked great on this watch . it ' s the & # 34 ; 20mm speidel genuine calfskin leather padded stitched tan brown mens tone on tone stitching watch band strap & # 34 ; . one big concern i have about this watch is the crystal possibly becoming badly scratched . there aren ' t many mentions in reviews about it happening , but i know it ' s been a big problem on many other casio watches in recent years , including my two most recent casio watches . they never used to scratch like this . my current casio , an aq150w - 1ev ana - digi chronograph sport watch , has 1 & # 34 ; long raised ridges around the crystal at the 12 and 6 o ' clock positions , yet it still has scratches . the mq24 - 7b has no protection and looks like it ' s guaranteed to get scratched , but perhaps it ' s being made with better quality crystal that resists scratching . one thing that took getting used to for me was the small diameter of the watch body . the watch face itself is about the same size as my other watches , but the body is so much narrower and thinner that at first it doesn ' t seem like a men ' s watch . if you like a large watch , don ' t buy this one , but if you want a straightforward , good looking watch ( except for the band ! ) that gets good reviews , this is an ideal choice , especially at the current price of $ 8 . 27 . 
if you have a small wrist this is the watch , i have been picking these rubber watches and now have two of them ( i bought a frank lloyd wright casio ) and they are fun , clean looking , kinda space age , petite and they give you the option of matching what you want to wear and how you feel . . . . a fun watch . 
i just need a cheap watch for work . my last one of 10 + years finally had the strap break . when this one arrived and i tried it on i was surprised to find out how small - ish it was . it was about 3 / 4 the size of a regular watch , and the band barely fit around my wrist . i put it right back in the box , sent in a return request and mailed it back same day . getting a refund and will try again . thanks amazon . 
i don ' t wear watches much but i needed to know what time it was at my previous job . i just bought the cheapest watch i could find , but it actually turned out to be really nice . at least 3 random customers said , & # 34 ; oh i like your watch & # 34 ; and were surprised when i told them that it was just $ 9 . it ' s been soaked and submerged in water and is still going strong . it ' s super slim and comfortable , i hardly even notice that i ' m wearing a watch ( those massive $ 200 watches look ridiculous anyway ) . if you just need a simple watch to keep track of time , this is perfect . even if it breaks , you smash it , etc . you can just replace it for another $ 9 . i would definitely buy it again . 
simple straight forward watch for casual , everyday wear . keeps time effectively . is water proof for normal every day use . i like it and would recommend it for the price . 
this watch is inexpensive , attractive and accurate . the numbers are easy to read and there is a second hand . straightforward design , no glow - in - the - dark , light , calendar , or special functions . however , the band is a bit short . it measures 8 1 / 8 " from the hinge of the buckle to the last hole - - which you really can ' t use without losing the watch . the rubbery material doesn ' t seem to be stretching out , either . if you have large wrists or like to wear a watch loose like a bracelet , then this one may not be ideal . otherwise , at this price it would make sense to buy a new watch rather than have the battery replaced in another inexpensive one . the movement is made in japan and the watch is assembled in china . the front says " water resist " and the metal back says " water resistant " which means it is okay to wash your hands while wearing it but not to submerge it in water . 
for the price , this is a really good watch . it doesn ' t have the bells and whistles of more expensive watches , such as the date , but it accurately tells time , and i love the slim profile . very durable and better than some more expensive watches i ' ve owned . 
nice watch , excellent price ( under $ 10 ) but not as nice as one i owned in the 80 ' s . it ' s sold as a ' unisex ' but it is so small in diameter that it has the look of a ladies watch ( and i ' m not that large of a male 130lbs . ) . the watch itself is very thin , and the strap is also very thin . bought it because it ' s cheaper to buy a new one then have the battery replaced ! 
there were 10 watches in the package , which was a nice surprise . they are decent quality and will work fine for a friend who was required to have a basic watch for his nursing school , clinical rotations . 
i got carried away and bought four casio watches . one i returned two i use when i ' m not working and this one i use when i ' m on the job . for the price i paid it does ' nt matter if it gets messed up . so far it & # 34 ; takes a lickin ' and keeps on tickin ' & # 34 ; i like it . 
just received my casio mq24 - 7b today . all i can say is that for the price i paid , it is simply awesome , simple and slick . believe me , people really stop to notice how simplistic but otherwise truly elegant this timepiece is . at a glance you can see clearly the current time without even a struggle . it beats a digital watch hands down if your own choice is to determine the correct time . i had several people within a span of 30 minutes ask me for the correct time while waiting at a bus stop . the odd thing about it was that each of them also had a wristwatch but yet chose to ask me for the time of day . truly , the design is very attractive and does garnera lot of attention . imagine now if this same design can be constructed of higher quality materials , it would probably be ranked among the finest watches available . anyhow , really marvelous timepiece . hope it lasts a long time . otherwise , i will just get another . 
i have been transported straight back to the 1980s . this watch is perfect for my needs : cheap ! waterproof ! el light ( very easy to read in dark ) stopwatchcalendardaily alarmi really like the fit style of the bracelet and the fact it doesn ' t pinch my arm hairs . i am a very large person ( 6 ' 6 & # 34 ; tall ) and the bracelet fits my large wrist very well . setting the time and alarm is fairly straightforward . i read the manual but you can figure it out on your own in a few minutes even if you don ' t do that . the watch is very lightweight and looks quite stylish in a retro way . i seriously can ' t believe i only paid $ 17 for it , including shipping . i ' m now buying similar casio watches for all my family . the only feature i wish this watch had was a countdown timer . oh also it would be nice if the backlight stayed on for a few seconds on it ' s own instead of immediately going off when you release the button . still , those are minor quibbles . 
love the light . can be an everyday watch . you can count on accuracy and water resistance , band is adjustable / u just gotta love these vintage watches 
cheap but doesn ' t look cheap . casio is the best watch maker ever . durable . amazing style . elegant stainless steel band . u gotta have it 
not really a digital watch kinda guy but i had to pick up one of these little gems to keep . retro style to some , just plain style if you ask me . the illuminator function works great , stopwatch great , loud alarm . seems to keep time within 1 second per week . i set it a month ago and its 2 seconds off of the time . gov eastern time zone now . not too shabby . i ' m going to wear it to work for a few weeks ( at a cnc machine shop ) where it will be covered in metal chips , machine coolant , oil , grease , water , etc on a daily basis . if it manages to handle all of that this will be the perfect digital watch . 
excellent as all of casio watches , this one is no exception . my son is very happy with this gift . electro luminescence display is very attractive and not as traditional lights that have clocks . additionally , the strap is made of stainless metal more durable than a resin band . 
this is a great everyday watch that not only looks good but keeps excellent time . i also like the adjustable band that should be on higher priced watches . highly recommend this nice watch ! 
i bought this bracelet watch because i got sick of breaking rubber or plastic bands every year . this looks like it will hold up for years . the timekeeping and other functions work well . i like the lamp which lights up the face very brightly . i don ' t mind that it only works when you are pressing it . i have had this for weeks and am still delighted when i use it . 
i ' m wearing mine now . they keep excellent time , has an easy - to - use alarm feature , and feels nice and comfortable . the band is especially comfortable and easy - to - use . the only downside is that the watch ' case ' is made of plastic ( used to be solid stainless steel ) and the watch breaks where the band pins go into the watch . the watch still works , but you can ' t wear it . bummer . 
got this watch on sale at sears for around 25 $ i needed an alarm but hate the all digital watches and couldn ' t afford an all analog watch with alarm and chrono so i got this . casio makes way more analog / digital combo watches that any other maker . this watch is fantastic , large buttons , simple digital functions , you got the time on top then month , day and day of week on bottom . then alarm , stopwatch and a second timezone if you need that on bottom instead of the date . . illuminator blue light lights up analog and digital display . . if i could change one thing i would give this watch a glass crystal because after a while you get scratches because its a plastic face . but all you need is to buff it with ' white paste style toothpaste ' and it looks brand new again . some people might have trouble reading the digital display , its not very big . 
seems like a good watch for the money . i only needed it for around the house and at the gym so i think it will work fine . 
i have more expensive watches but only wear this one . being a nurse , plus swim inst . this watch is wet more than not , showers too . have never had aproblem just a scratched face with use . that can be helped with cleaning with toothpase rub . recommend this watch for nayone wanting a accurate , inexpensive , and durable watch . . . . . . . casio is the best . 
i got this watch for my dad who hasn ' t bought a watch for a real long time and the one he was wearing was twenty five years old . he really enjoys wearing it . 
i have a thing for watches and casio have style and quality i admire and i will always buy this product 
this watch is a welcome change sfter three years with the only casio watch i ' ve ever disliked ( see my review of the casio w752d - 1av ) . this watch is good looking and mostly well laid out , with two exceptions . it ' s my first analog face watch since i was a kid , and i find that i like displaying time this way . you don ' t need to read the watch to tell time ; just glancing at the position of the hands does it . one thing you need to be aware of though : if you want to display the date or alarm in the tiny digital window , you ' ll have to set the time twice : once for the analog face and separately for the digital . setting the analog face time is simple : just pull out the stem , turn it to the right time , and push the stem back in to set the time . setting the digital time is a similar procedure to any other digital time piece . the backlight is very bright , making the analog face very easy to read at night , but i try to avoid this so i can conserve the battery . i only have two complaints , both of them about the digital display window : 1 ) the way it displays the date and the day of the week . there ' s no space where you ' d expect it , between the date and the day , but the is a space where you don ' t expect it , separating the two letters of the day . for example , i ' m writing this on tuesday november 15 . this displays on the watch as " 11 - 15t u " . it ' s not a huge problem but it is a constant annoyance and makes it somewhat harder to decipher under low light . 2 ) the digital window is very small , making it difficult to read under low light conditions . i doubt whether i ' ll use the chronograph very often for this reason . i ' ve owned the aq150w - 1ev ana - digi for almost two weeks . if problems turn up , i ' ll update this review , but so far , i am very glad i choose this watch . update # 1 : after three months of ownership , i have three observations to make : 1 ) after you get used to a digital watch face , it ' s much easier to read than a digital face , especially under low light conditions and without wearing glasses . rather than reading numbers , i just look at the position of the gold hands on the black background . this is not only convenient , it extends battery life because i never need to use the watch ' s built - in light . 2 ) the clear crystal is already scratched , despite the fact that i work at a desk and don ' t expose it to rough conditions . this happened to my last casio also , but never happened to any of the casio ' s i owned for decades before , so it must be a recent trend . 3 ) the little window with the date and chronograph is so small that it ' s useless . i never even look at it . overall i still like this watch after three months and would buy it again . update # 2 , after 18 months of ownership : the watch band broke . casio has discontinued this band , even though the watch is still being sold . i replaced the band with a " chums the band 20mm watch band " , which is only $ 5 . 76 as of this writing ( may 2013 ) . the band is a tight fit for this watch - i had to use small , sharp needle nose pliers to pull the strap on . once on , it ' s a good fit . except for the band , i ' m still happy with this watch . i ' m especially glad that the face has not scratched badly like my previous casio watch . this one just shows the expected wear and tear . i was concerned whens scratches appeared soon after i started wearing it , but after 18 months they are much less noticeable than on my previous casio watch . it ' s a good looking watch , it ' s easy to read the time on it , and setting daylight savings on and off is much easier than with digital face watches . i don ' t use the digital functions at all . they ' re too small to be really useful . for chronograph functions i use a separate heart rate monitor . 
this was a watch i dearly wanted to like . it looked like it had it all . a full analog display , with the digital display below it , instead of hidden underneath the analog hands for 4 hours every day . design was nice , simple , neutral colors , and the watch itself is not too large to fit on smaller wrists . perfection ? well . . . not quite ! i don ' t know how casio ' s engineers did it , but it is almost as if they purposefully designed the plastic cover of the digital display to catch nearly all angles of light . then they recessed the display deeply back into the watch face , so if your angle gets too sharp , you can ' t read it . . . . but you also can ' t read it head - on due to glare ! you end up having to play hide - and - go - seek anytime you want to read the digital display , carefully angling your wrist until you find the sweet spot . you end up doing that instead of the simple action of just looking at your wrist , noting the time , and moving on with your day . i returned it after less than two days . 
i received the casio men ' s aq150w - 1ev ana - digi chronograph sport watch . it is a great watch . everybody loves the way it looks and works . 
nothing exceptional , obviously you get what you pay for . the design is quite nice , not big not small . . . just ok . . . the materials , quite cheap as anything " cased in china " . . . the good thing is a casio , i know this one wont last for long , but i wanted something simple as i will be traveling and didnt want to take with me my favorite watches . for now it gets 3 stars . . after i come back i will let you know . . 
very small for man and it looks good only on picture but to actually see it , its a bit disappointing . it is plain and simple . should be priced at $ 20 only 
nicely sized watch with easy to read analog face and variety of digital settings . digital readout is small and somewhat difficult to read . 
yeah . . . i ' m sticking with a g - shock , the hands stopped working , the straps were already coming apart , and the face and part of the body started to crack . did not survive the standard abuse i have given my previous g - shock that had lasted for 10 years . 
i bought this watch about two years ago . it maintains the time accurately in water or out . you couldn ' t beat the price , i recommend this for a low cost watch . 
this year i will be the gifter all my family will have the best and that includes my brother in law , 
this is a nice looking watch . works well . i like the analog and digital time views . however , i am a gym rat and i ' ve had better watched to use in the gym . 
casio tiene la caracter & iacute ; stica que dura por muchos a & ntilde ; os , muy resistente . este reloj tiene un display invertido donde los n & uacute ; meros no son negros como es tradici & oacute ; n , son blancos y eso hace diferencia en el dise & ntilde ; o . no le he visto a nadie mas otro de estos puesto , haci & eacute ; ndolo & uacute ; nico y diferente . lo & uacute ; nico malo es que el pulso no le dur & oacute ; mucho ( claro que esto es una caracter & iacute ; stica de todos los casio , ya que el pulso no les dura mucho a todos los casio y tengo varios ! ! pero el cambio no cuesta mucho y por alg & uacute ; n motivo los nuevos si duran mucho tiempo ! ) . tiene lo b & aacute ; sico de un reloj digital mas el backlight . es muy econ & oacute ; mico y liviano . 
in my opinion , it is hard to operate . analog hands must be set independently from time on watch . you cannot run the hands backwards , so you potentially have to hold the button down for several minutes to get to where you need to be . much bulkier than it appears . 
i always wear it , working , on the beach , sleeping . casio watches are all - terrain all - the time , i ' ll have it till it last the weak side of casio watches are the plastic belts over the time this plastic ages and breaks . 
i wanted a watch with analog and digital interface . so found this witch looks great , the digital clock has big and clear numbers . the auto light function is so cool . it has 4 alarms , world time and other casio features . the only thing i hate about this watch is build quality . my jacket scratched it on my first week . the screen is made from plastic and it catches every scratch . you can even scratch it with your finger nails if you want . not just the screen , every thing else is also cheap . after few months of everyday usage you will need to change it . bad bad bad please casio keep the same design but make it better . add a glass screen , change the plastic case with something better . i will be willing to pay an extra 100 bucks for a quality similar to sieko or pulsar . 
i love this watch ! i purchased this watch over 2 years ago . after i broke the band ( due to abnormal wear and tear ) , i bought the watch again on amazon . i ' ll buy it again 100 more times . this watch does everything i need it to do . 
wow , what a great watch . the night light is great . the ease at checking the time in 27 cities is great . you can have 12hr and 24hr run simultaneous . time , date , day all in one . waterproof to 100 meters and looks good . the perfect all - around everyday watch . 
just arrived , here are some quick thoughts . most of this is off top of my head as i set it up . might be a bit random . more later when i get to know this thing . the watch ' s face is far too shiny , can ' t see anything if there is overhead fluorescent lighting . amazing . i ' ve used several generations of these casios and know the ui pretty well . it is improving but still a pain in the ass to setup . the hand setting is still pathetic , takes forever to go ahead on the analog side by 11 hours and god forbid if you miss . oh did i mention there are no analog numbers on the face ( 1 , 2 , 3 . . . ) . unbelievable . we have 5 , 10 , 15 , why ? is this because people can ' t read the time any more and they need the numbers ? the big display is the digital time , i somehow thought it would be the date which is why i bought this cause the other casios hide the date in small unreadable displays . looks like the watch design is so tied to the band that replacing the band is going to be impossible . initial rating is 3 stars , i ' m using it reluctantly while thoroughly disappointed . update on 2013 - 05 - 25i return here while shopping for a new watch . i have used this for over 1 . 5 years . i finally have given up . it is hard to read , the face is unreadable as it reflects light in any indoor setting . the lighting is ok at night , worthless in the . the feature to turn on the light when you move your wrist works occasionally . worthless . the face scratches far easier than any watch i have ever used . the date is obscured by the minute had every hour when i look for the date when taking notes . the functionaly for timing all over the world is a mess and gets in the way of doing anything else with the digital portion of this watch . i give up , i ' m moving on . downgrading to 2 stars . can ' t believe i used this for so long . 
this is a sporty watch with a very classy look . the value well exceeds the price . it is easy on the eye , and displays the time using analog simultaneously with the digital display in the same spot without interfering with the other . nice blue illumination , and has all the standard features of a digital sports watch . it looks very nice on . i am very pleased with this purchase . 
it ' s hard not to like this watch . i needed a budget time keeper for work that i could bang around and not worry about what i invested into it with bonus points for actually looking nice . after a toss up between this and the stainless version , i remembered what i was using it for and went for the cheaper of the two . first , it looks far better than it does in the picture here . the faux chrome edging is shiny and reflective , the digital portion is imminently readable and the analog hands rarely get in the way of your ability to read the digital time . it ' s not a slim watch by any standard , but it ' s not a fattie g - shock either and wears comfortably . overall , i have to say it looks reasonably stylish , as opposed to looking like you bought it off the $ 5 rack at walmart or just stepped off your kid ' s school bus . the value for the money is excellent . digital world time , four alarms , a snooze , hourly chime , stop watch / countdown , analog glow in the dark hands , back lit digital , water resistant to 100m and perhaps my favorite of all : tilt - o - glow . tilt - a - what ? yeah , i didn ' t see that on any online summary either but i swear to god it ' s in the manual . simply tilt your hand to read the watch and it automatic backlights for you . seriously . while this watch is slightly cheaper at walmart , you simply can ' t go wrong with this watch anywhere under $ 30 . 00 . the only drawback i can even point to so far is that adjusting the analog dial is a painfully slow to adjust . there ' s no dedicated manual adjust ; it ' s one button , forward only and all ahead slow . realistically speaking , however , how often are you going to adjust the analog anyway ? it ' s such a small issue in my eyes that i ' m still rating it five stars and would buy it again if i spontaneously lost it . * tilt - o - glow : there ' s no offical name for this feature beyond " auto illumination " in the manual . from the main display , simply hold down the illumination button ( c ) for five seconds . if a little star appears by the date , you ' re done . 
this is a very nice , simple to use watch . controls are well laid out . operation is easy and intuitive . display is easy to read and night illumination works great . the watch would have received 5 stars was it not for the band , which is a bit on the stiff and thin side . hopefully it will not break too soon . overall , i would recommend this watch to anyone looking for an inexpensive , nice looking sport watch with a good set of useful features . 
i bought this in january of 08 and the face glass is very badly scratched up from careful wearing . just a slight brushing on a door , table or any object puts scratches on it and after a while it gets where you can ' t see the time without the scratches getting in the way . the little strap piece that you slide the extra end of the band into broke off too . other then that the watch is great and works well . i decided to replace it with a g - shock because of the inset face design to prevent scratches . ( g - shock men ' s watch g - shock youth culture g - 306x - 1adr - ww ) 
i had a simple casio analog watch with push button backlight , and i loved it . unfortunately , it seems to have stopped functioning after only a year or so . it was very inexpensive but they no longer sell it . this watch is priced about the same and i was worried about it for several reasons . it seemed to have too many buttons and functions , causing confusion , and it ' s a bit taller than my old watch . i can report that my worries were mostly unfounded . the instructions are very easy to follow and , once programmed , there is very little most people will have to remember . i have no intention of using this watch as an alarm , stopwatch or anything other than to tell time and light up when i need it . it does those things quite well . it also has one more very cool feature . by pushing one button , you can set the back light to go on whenever you lift your wrist and look at it . that setting lasts up to six hours or until you cancel it , to save battery life . i set it before going to spin class and then only need one hand to check the time in the dark . really nice . interesting display . the hands do not light . instead , the digital display lights up behind the hands . but the digital display is fairly easy to read , even for those of us who normally need reading glasses . also , it takes one simple adjustment to toggle between daylight and standard time , eliminating the need for resetting the digital time . a nice touch . the watch is a bit rounder on top than i might have preferred , but really not to big for my smallish wrists . the good trade off is that it is more water resistant , and that ' s very nice . i also think it has a nice appearance that makes it worth at least double the price . overall , a good purchase and i would recommend it . one more thing . if you are worried that the buttons are confusing , or you won ' t have the instructions when you need them , just do what i did . make notes on your smartphone about the functions you think you will need , and refer to those when you need help . 
good , inexpensive running watch . i ' m on my third . batteries last a couple of years and technically they ' re replaceable but i ' ve never been able to get the watch to reseal after changing the batteries , so when you see fog inside the & # 34 ; crystal & # 34 ; you know it ' s too late . batteries last about 3 years so in essence the watch lasts three years . 
this watch is easy to take care of and looks professional . i like wearing my watch all the time , i don ' t want to have to take it off at night . with leather or fabric straps , you have to make sure they don ' t get wet . this watch has rubber straps so that isn ' t an issue . my husband had this watch first and i loved it so much , i ordered one for myself . it is larger than traditional women ' s watches but i like having a large watch face so i can easily read the time . the price is great and my husband has had his watch for 2 years without issue . 
this baby works as advertised and the setup instructions are easily followed ( our chinese suppliers are getting a handle on english ) great value , if the battery fails before 2023 , i ' ll be right back to let you know about it . 
this little gem was at my doorstep quickly . i have been very happy with it after wearing it for just a week . it is comfortable & lightweight , and it fits well . it looks exactly as thepicture ( s ) show . it is the perfect size for a small wrist like mine . those saying the instructions are hard to follow maybe need to work on their reading comprehension skills , because in just a few short minutes i had the entire watch set and ready to go . i had zero problems with the instructions ; the print is a little small , but they are no - nonsense and stright to the point . i love all the features on this timepiece , it ' s exactly what i wanted in a non - flashy , workplace watch . i am already about to order it ' s brother , the one with a darker face , just to have a choice of colors to wear . the only knock on this one is the light is a tad to dim , other than that , this thing is a huge bargain for $ 20 ! i love it ! 
no matter that it is no so easy to fix all watch things , once you get it work easy with no need to review constantly 
this is a very good quality watch for the cost and the speed of delivery was exceptional . 8 . 99 was a great price for a ten year battery watch and water proof to three hundred meters you cant beat for that price 
i am very pleased with this watch . it feels well on the wrist , looks good and keeps perfect time . the manual is written clearly , and it is quite easy to set the analog and digital features of the watch . i set it to an atomic clock so that it is accurate to the second and remains so a month later . 
i have had this watch for @ 2 months now . i say for under 20 dollars it ' s a pretty good watch . it has kept perfect time over 2 months . it is lightweight and the band is very comfortable . i like having the analog hands and being able to display the digital date / time . now in no way do i expect this watch to be anywhere near the quality of my citizens chronograph , my invicta diver or my swiss army officers watch . the casio is a watch i bought for bumming around . on the negative side , the light does not do a very good job of illumination . additionally , setting the time is really cumbersome . setting the anaog time is not too bad , but setting the digital date and time is really a pain . keep the instructions handy , you will need it when you have to change the time . all in all , for @ 15 dollars , it is a nice decent watch . a good value purchase 
the casio men ' s world time watch ( model aw80 - 7av ) has a couple of compelling good points : first , it is very cheap and does have numerous features ( though many of them are of questionable value ) ; second , it seems to be reasonably accurate . if this is all you care about , this could be a good watch for you . the watch has several cons to be wary of , however . it is very light ( which is actually a plus ) but the band is extremely thin and flimsy . in other words , it is cheap and looks it . more annoying though is the very dim light for use in low light : it is completely inadequate and makes the functionality in the inset digital portion of the face next to worthless ; the lack of contrast between the hands and watch face also contribute to the legibility issue . most irritatingly , though , is that it doesn ' t have a set knob , even for the analog hands . i fly for a living and frequently cross back and forth between time zones . i had read that the watch could only be set in a forward direction , which was annoying but not a deal breaker . what is not evident is the lack of a setting knob , which means that each time you need to change the time ( or do anything else , for that matter ) you have to use an array of complex inputs with the four buttons which is not only very time consuming ( the watch advances in 20 second increments ) , but also requires consultation with the ridiculously complex and thick instruction manual . while this watch may be suitable for people who don ' t cross time zones frequently , use it in daylight , and don ' t mind referring to the manual frequently ( or memorizing a huge quantity of mundane , unintuitive minutiae ) , for anyone else , and especially for frequent travelers , i recommend finding another watch . 
cheap plastic watch . case is plastic , lens is plastic , band is plastic . so guess what ? the lens get scratched easily , and the case gets chips easily . has long band for fat wrists . excellent for a guy who loses or destroys watches . . . and sunglasses . i would get this instead : timex men ' s t2n696 elevated classics dress sport collection blue resin strap watch 
picture shows blue background but it ' s incorrect . must be the angle and lighting used when they took the picture . also , if you are unfamiliar with adjusting the band ( which requires special tools ) means you have to take it to a watch repair shop and pay extra . otherwise , i wear it as my everyday watch and it looks great . analog time lags so have to adjust every so often . 
chinese nockoffi smelled chineese dung but i bought it anywaywe send our dollars to the billion that hate usbut we employ them in nuclear facilities and they spy on us ! ! ! ! i smell chineese junk . . . not the boat that floats butthe other stuff that we flush down the toilet . i know that stuff floats too . . . jund - k is junkbut some stuff smells like awdav ( not japanese ) 
casio is well known for making excellent and inexpensive watches . i bought this one because it is the least expensive casio , but still boasts a 10 - year battery and combo analog and digital time / date / day display . it even has a metal wristband ! most watches at this price point have rubber or plastic bands . i highly recommend this watch if you demand accurate time - keeping and reliable quality , while want to spend as little as possible . 
i ' ve tried several watches of this type and find this one is not only the easiest , but it was the one i was able to set the alarms on . 
bought this watch for my husband , one year and two weeks ago . the 10 year battery died 10 days ago . no special use . no underwater use , just normal wear and tear . i bought this watch thinking it would not need a battery change as often . . and replaced his old watch that got about 2 years per battery . . and this one got one year and four days . wouldn ' t recommend it because that is a very misleading statement about this watch ! 
i am glad that this watch doesn ' t look like a $ 20 cheap watch . the metal band is one of the key reason for me to choose this watch . i don ' t want watches with plastic or leather band . i know metal band is a little bit tricky to resize . the manual does not mention about how to resize the band . i am a handy person with some precision tools around . even so , it still took me about half hour to resize the metal band . i can imagine that some people will need a trip to a watch store to resize the band . i don ' t count this as a negative point . but people need to know this ahead . the setting procedures are very similar to other electronic watches . it should be very straightforward for people that had prior electronic watch experience . the 10 year battery life is definitely a plus . in summary , for around $ 20 , this is definitely a great buy . 
it has all kinds of functions , very good . the actual item looks excactly like the picture . 
my husband likes everything about this watch except the color . when i ordered it , i thought it would have a blue face . it actually has a sort of subdued lavender face ( my husband called it purple , but it is not that shocking ) , which is also very nice , but he would have felt more comfortable if it had a blue face . he is wearing the watch none - the - less . i don ' t know why the amazon watch description says " blue dial " , if it really isn ' t . 
this is a very cheap wath and looks well . i was looking for a weekend / sport watch and decided to buy this one by the price . i m very satisfied because was more than i expected and looks prety weel for " office using " also 
the watch looks great and keeps excellent time . the band is comfortable and sturdy and the lighted dial is perfectly designed to view time in the dark . the watch has a lot of features for such an inexpensive item but it ' s really hard to remember how to use them . the setting and operation sequences seem pretty counter - intuitive to me . even though it ' s not called a " daily alarm " the alarm seems to go off every day at the same time without re - setting . but i really need to keep the instructions handy if i want to be able to stop it instead of just hitting " snooze " . the alarm is not very loud . i won ' t hear it if i ' m in a noisy place . someone else pointed out that the crystal scratches easily and they were so right ! even though i work in an office and am very careful , mine somehow picked up a wide nasty scratch in just days . i used to have a bottle of " plastic polish " that might buff the scratches out . most of the special features are not useful to me so this was a good deal but not a great one .

man , is this watch hard to reset anything on . almost need to be a rocket scientist to figure out how . without instruction book , you will go mad . three stars for longevity . 
when i was looking for a watch i figured i ' d spend the usual forty or fifty bucks for a so / so watch . . but . . i spied this one and wondered if , at that price , it would be worth checking out . i liked the looks etc . but couldn ' t help wondering if it was really a good watch ? i ' ve now had it over a year and it keeps very good time . i use the stop watch often and have no problems with it . it still looks good , runs good and even the band seems to be of good quality . ( though it was a bit of a challenge trying to shorten it ) , bottom line is . . . don ' t let the price fool you , this is a great deal ! ! ! 
very nice and practical watch , i recoment it to all my friends ( girls and men ) also for sports , walk and work 
this is a great casual watch . i actually bought two , one in green and one tan . very easy to set and they look great ! you can not find a better casual watch for the price ! 
i wanted a watch that i could wear during the summer going hiking and kayaking and didn ' t want to wear any of my nicer watches . this watch is lightweight and durable . it hardly feels like it ' s there . the water resistance seems to hold up . i ' ve taken it kayaking and although i take it off when i swim , it has gotten dunked and splashed with no moisture seeping under the crystal . i like the color and design . it has kind of a military look to it . the watch battery is supposed to last ten years so i hope a replacement band is available as i ' m sure the velcro might wear out in the mean time . i ' m very happy with my purchase an affordable yet durable timepiece . 
i have been having bad luck with certain casio watches . this one broke after only a few months of use . it broke right in the area where the watch band pins are inserted so now it is a pocket watch . i have 3 other casio watches that broke in this same area . it was also hard to get the analog time in sync with the digital time . it might be a good casual watch for people if they are careful with it and the green color is pretty cool . 
what i love about this watch : 1 . simple to set both analogue and digital time ( don ' t believe the naysayers ) 2 . it is lightweight and the velcro strap fits your wrist perfectly3 . the hands , once charged in front of a lightbulb , luminate brighter than my timex4 . the night light works great and it actually helps charge the hands5 . the watch is waterproof so i won ' t have to take it off in the shower , washing the car etc6 . dial is easy to read7 . world time is handy , as i have relatives overseas in different countries8 . telememo for 30 phone numbers and it ' s a breeze to input the data9 . 3 alarms and an hourly chime including snooze alarm10 . timer and stopwatch11 . the price and the lookso , i guess i love everything about this watch , i hardly notice i ' m wearing itjust a perfect work watch , i should have bought this model years ago . 
i liked this watch so much that i bought another ! it ' s a good deal for the price . i really like the features of this watch , and the set - up is easy and straight foward . download the instruction pdf for easier reading and set - up . i ' ll be testing it ' s water resistance soon and give an update . no problems with shipping . 
this watch looks great and matches some camo i have , but it ' s not as practical as you might like . it does not have indiglo and the hands only stay lit for a short time in darkness . it is also not comfortable when wet , as the fabric band holds the moisture a lot . it does take a beating and keep looking pretty , but it ' s also a really small face , so not exactly the most masculine watch ever . 
i wanted a simple / cheap watch to beep every hour ( trying to do that lucid dreaming where you use the beeps to check to see if you ' re sleeping . . . still trying : ) 
item was as described and in great condition . 4stars only because the velcro strap cannot fit small wrists . but all in all the watch lived up to expectations . 
this watch doesn ' t look nearly as good on my wrist as it did in the photo on the amazon page . i should have known not to expect much from a $ 20 watch . 
having owned numerous casio watches , and having purchased this particular one for a gift , i wasdisappointed . setting it proved time consuming , and i simply did not return it due to the fact i hadpromised a & # 34 ; watch & # 34 ; gift to a grandson . bottom line , casio makes a good , dependable product butsome models are difficult to program . . 
this is one of two i bought and they are easy to use and inexpensive . i really like the ease of use and simple design . 
i purchased this for my husband even though he has 300 . 00 watches he loved this watch . i don ' t know if it is still on sale with prime but to see his face light up when it arrived was worth a million dollars ! he wears it everyday ! i knew he wanted it for i went onto his amazon to look at something and saw it on his wish list ! you simply can ' t beat the price order you husband one today or perhaps your son . it really looks good on his arm : ) 
casio watches have always been high quality and this one did not disappoint me . it was purchased for a christmas gift and made the person very pleased . 
this is actually a pretty snazzy watch that draws complements for it ' s cloth band and color . the time zone and alarm functions make it very practical for travel across time zones , and it ' s cheap enough that there ' s no need to conceal it in potentially risky tourist areas around the world . my only reason to give it less than 5 stars is that the method to set and change times is far from intuitive and i find it takes me a while each time to rediscover the method . for the price , especially , this is an excellent option . i just wished i had saved the directions . . . 
this gift was given as a gift to a young boy in the neighborhood . i understand from his father , the young man likes the watch and wears it constanctly . it was pretty neat . no he can tell the time around the world . 
bought this ' cause i like analog watches and the casio brand , and wanted a retro - look brown case with white face . however , as a previous poster noted , it is way too complicated . i pride myself on setting up any of the 5 or so casio watches i ' ve owned without using the manual , but not this one ! also , i don ' t like the velcro band as it looks cheap , but some people may not agree . also , the light function is not a good as other casio watches . 
this was a gift for my son . he loved this watch ! the quality was great for the price . a great watch for work ! 
was very happy with watch as i had purchased the same one in black a couple of years ago . reason for buying it had the velcro strap buckle which gave a perfect fit and easy to put on . 
i love this watch . 10 year battery and i don ' t have the set the thing for a 28 , 30 or 31 day month . it ' s good until 2099 . lots of other features as well . 
watch and band are ok . the band strap o - ring ( holds extra band ) has elastic which stretches too easily . the set up is a nightmare . it is impossible to remember hot to change time . illumination is ok , but button hard to find in the dark . watch is great for keeping time . no other features of the watch i can use , because i do not want to take time to figure them out . it is not intuitive . 
great purchase ! this watch not only looks good , but it complements my desert uniforms . provides adequate lighting for night operations . 
i purchased this watch and my son wantedone so i bought another for him . at the priceit is cheaper to import from amazon than buyingin my country . light weight and comfortable to wear , thedigital display is easy to read and i never takeit off . water resistant in the shower and greatwhen sailing it is the perfect ' beater ' watch . inputting data was a breeze and the light works well , the luminous hands keep on glowing all night long andglow brighter than my timex . every digital feature ofthis watch is useful to me , the perpetual calendar inparticular . i ' m hard on watches so if i get 3 years use from itbefore i break it or the battery needs replacing , iwill be more than happy . 
great watch for the price of cheap china ' s watches1 year warranty + 10 years batterygreat for sports or very day use i really like it seems good qualityand it looks exactly as the first 3 picturesthe diameter is a bit small ( like big diameter watches ) but its great and better than other cheap watches . . . great buy 
often invaded company casio world of products and models , is flooded each eye and hit all heard ! economic well - known products from cheap to very expensive and with the amazing features , and versatility is hard to describe , and this product is a venerable brand creations , & this product is especially for those who prefer the size of the average and suit them , each casio products against water and water - resistant fully real , competitive price amazon prices compared with other vendors and good customer service and shipping distinctive 
a military friend of mine ( retired ) , whom i forced a gift idea from , told me his old watch was no longer functioning correctly . i had only two requirements when i started looking for a watch . no massive / ridiculous face that looks like a cartoon , and it must either have a canvas or leather wrist band . this watch fit my requirements perfectly . he seemed to be very happy with his gift and it made me happy to see him smile . thanks 
keep your instructions when you toss the rest of the packing away . you ' ll want them when you adjust any setting until you get used to it . no second hand , which is fine for me . nice appearance , and fairly small on your wrist . 
i bought this for my 13 - year - old son . he has a small wrist , but i ' m sure he will be growing . this fully velcroed band is perfect ! the directions are written very small , and are thus difficult to read , but i was able to figure it out and set this watch . he loves that it tells time in different zones , though you have to push a button to get to this feature . he would have liked to have the european time zone displayed continually . you can only display the day and date or the digital time continually . this watch also has a timer and can store phone numbers . 
this is a good deal for the price . if you just need a basic light weight watch to wear around that you will not even notice is on your are , this is it . 
this cheap watch looks really cool and it looks not like its price . it can be priced above $ 30 . im happy to get this one . 
it loses 5 minutes a month - - - unheard of for a " digital " watch ! ! ! tons of " special " features - - - but all are displayed too small for anyone to see ! the manual is about 200 tiny pages - - - with even smaller print . you have to study it for at least an hour , just to set the time ! garbage don ' t buy ! 
pros : * appearance - the best - looking ( to my tastes ) combination analog and digital watch i ' ve seen . sized well for a small arm ; case is a little thick but not too wide . easy to read in light ( see cons about the night light ) . * buttons - easy to access , and they don ' t protrude from the case like timex ' s do . there ' s not even a crown . * comfort - lightweight , wears very well . * functions - alarm is loud and easy to hear . two alarms are a plus , but the screwy " snooze alarm " is definitely a con . it also has all those other functions , but i only use the timer . * accuracy - spot on after 48 hours , rated to + / - 30 seconds a month . cons : * setting the hands - they only go forward , not back . if it ' s set ahead , like mine was when i got it , you have to hold down two buttons simultaneous then watch the hands spin around until you stop them , then goose them to the right setting . * night light - ok if the hands are illuminated , but useless otherwise . only illuminates sides of face . * velcro strap - i never have had good luck with them , they always fray or stain , so i replaced it with a water - resistant leather strap that looks great on it . * snooze alarm - this is just goofy . if you set it , the fool thing sounds every five minutes until you deactivate it . * alarm programming - timex is way ahead of casio on this . my old timex digital had three alarms with weekday / weekend / daily / off options . casio ' s are time only . 
decent watch for the money but directions are confusing . probably the most complicated directions of any watch i owned previously . also most of the watchband consists of a velcro band so not the most stylish arrangement . however if you want a cheap watch with a lot of features this is it . 
i like canvas and that is one of the reasons i bought this watch . also it has a 10 year battery . also it is bothdigital and analog . finally , you have to be patient when adjusting the watch . 
this watch looks really slick and i liked it a lot . however , there are problems . the surface scratches very very easily . i once had a minor incident whereby another persons jade just lightly touched my watch , so trivial i didn ' t think anything would scratch . when i had a look , i had a scratch on the watch . another problem is with the resin strap . it cracked after a year usage and it broke within less than 2yr usage . now i can ' t wear it . not worth buying the strap ( can ' t use non propriety ones ) . 
i really like the watch because of the display of the watch , but also the color of the second hand and the regular hands on the watch because it is easier for me to see and i like that i can see it at night when the lights are out . 
casio makes a great line of affordable shiny things . this is a durable watch that has one , and only one knock against it in my book . it comes with the proprietary casio wrist band system that doesn ' t allow me to customize my strap choice . that being said , the rubber strap is very comfortable and an excellent choice to wear during a rigorous work day . 
the watch ' s band is so stiff that it keeps sliding around to the side of my wrist and i have to struggle to get the watch face back so i can read it . if i tighten the band so it won ' t twist it is too uncomfortable . the watch itself is attractive but i was unable to set the small hands because i couldn ' t feel the double click on the winder stem as described in the instructions . all in all i just gave up and after a few days went back to my trusty timex . 
just a good watch , you can use it with any cloth and any occasions , is the first of this , happy with this beautiful watch 
i like many of you dont like a watch thats all plastic . and amazon needs to come up with better filtered search results . i searched through almost five thousand watches to find one that had an all metal stainless steel case . this one looked nice and what attracted me to it was the fancy extra dials . i wanted a watch that looked like it was expensive . a watch for dress occasions . the watch does not have a light to see it in the dark . which i believe it should have , the smaller dials are extremely hard to read , you almost need a magnifying glass to read them . 5 stars for the fact that its all metal . 2 stars for the fact that it badly needs a light and the smaller dials are hard to see . overall , its a good analogue watch to have . and its metal , not resin plastic that the majority of watches are made of . 
very satisfied . . . . . . . . . . . excellent very good good option for quality recommend the price and quality . . . muybuen to buy excelent 
good looking , quartz , stylish watch . keeps good time . sporty yet has a bit of flash ( that isn ' t really picked up in the promo pics ) . definitely a good value ! 
this watch i love it looks very expensive and for the price is even better 
i had been looking for a small faced , dressy ( not - plastic - sports - style , ) digital watch for months . they are very hard to find ! this is exactly what i had in mind . it is small , but easy to read . the case is thin and attractive , and the band is easy to adjust to fit perfectly . the only concern i have is that the clasp can be knocked open if bumped against something . ( i previously had a similar watch with a latch that folded out making a continuous loop so that it didn ' t fall off if accidentally opened . it saved the watch several times ! ) i haven ' t tried the alarm feature yet - but i will soon be on after - school grandchild pick up duty and i know i will use the alarm often ! 
this is definitely not the most attractive watch in the world but when it comes to functionality , it does the job . i bought it because it has a feature where it beeps every hour . it ' s reliable and works great . 
this is a great watch at a great price . i ' m on my third one in 20 years . true it doesn ' t last forever , but what do you want at this price ? i love the easy - to - use digital features , especially the countdown timer . i use it all the time for cooking or time - outs for the kids , or to remind myself that i really need to leave in 5 minutes ! last time my hubby changed the battery he messed up the water - proof gasket so now i need a new one . i agree with others that the included watchband isn ' t the greatest . that ' s why i only gave 4 stars . long ago i bought a stretch band and now just swap it out . casio , please never stop making this watch . but consider changing the band to a stretch one . that would make this watch truly perfect . 
i love this watch and find it hard to believe other companies don ' t make a similar product . it contains an alarm clock , and you can set it to produce a single beep each hour on the hour . those are handy things to have on the job when you are too busy to keep track of anything . and the medal version is certainly attractive enough . the band is adjustable and will fit the widest wrist or the most narrow . 
the watch face is great for me : small enough to fit on a small wrist and large enough for me to see the numbers and letters . the date should be on the face rather than having to push one of the buttons and there is no backlight . the watch band , however , is awful , terrible , a disaster ! ! ! this is not a watch that i can grab and put on in a minute ; it usually takes me five . i must really like the watch because i am willing to fuss with it . it is not an expansion band even though it looks like it and the locking mechanism is a terrible piece of engineering . i ' m keeping the watch even though i didn ' t give it 5 stars . addition to my original review : i have had the watch less than six months and the clasp no longer works . do not buy this watch ! it is trouble and isn ' t worth the effort to wear it . i should have returned it when i could . a big waste of money . 
i was looking for something simple . i just wanted the time and date and nothing else . i was happy to find this at a reasonable price . it works well and i have even gotten it wet a couple of times washing dishes with no issues . 
i bought this watch to wear at work . it ' s stylish and i wanted a band that wasn ' t plastic , cloth , or leather . i work in the medical field mri department . we can only wear digital watches because of the magnetic field . my disappointment was that the metal band pulls in the magnetic field so i can ' t wear it . the band itself tends to not to clasp / lock in well and it falls off my waist . i might try to find a different watchband that is flexible ( metal - elastic type . ) 
i got this watch for school and my internships . i end up using the convenient quick - timer feature ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 30 minutes ) often as well as the stopwatch . it ' s water - resistant and held up well whenever i ' ve needed to wash my hands ( which can be several times at my internship , as i work in the medical field ) throughout the day . the face is easy to read and the strap is adjustable ; you just need a paperclip or small screwdriver to unlock the clasp and slide it along the strap to adjust it to your wrist size . 
i really like this watch . i needed to take it to a jeweler to shorten the band & may son to set it up . after that , i am on a roll ! 
i bought this watch and worked through the instructions on how to set all the wonderful features . it was a bit complex but doable . then i tried to put it on and of course it was too big . the clasp was a bit weird but i figured that out . then i tried to shorten the band by sliding the clasp up an inch or so . there were no instructions for how to do it . i even emailed casio and asked but then i tried to do it myself . after an hour of fussing : my eyes hurt , my finger was bleeding and the watch band clasp had disintergrated into two separate pieces that slid ever so easily on the band - there was no hope . i suspect i would have liked the watch , it ' s pretty and extremely useful , but if i can ' t wear it , it has no function . i ' ll be returning it if casio does not answer my email by tomorrow night with instructions i can follow . i am very sad indeed . 
the watch is as described but i am having a hard time to find someone who can shorten it for me . i am sure when i get it shortened everything will be perfect . casio did send me the instructions to shorten the watch but they are for another kind of casio . i may also call casio back ! can ' t wait to get it shortened so i can wear it . 
i had a watch like this for years . when it went dead , i was disappointed . i was delighted to see that the same type and brand was offered on amazon and immediately purchased another . it is my favorite . it does fit very loosely and is not a stretch band . however , i like the loose bracelet fit and find it comfortable . the watch arrived promptly . i am satisfied with the purchase . 
i think this is my third casio watche . for me they last about two and a half years and are very reliable . i believe you have to send them back to the dealer to get a new battery - since they are so cheap i don ' t bother and get a new one . they don ' t stop - the display just gets lighter and lighter until you can ' t read it . i usually get the black strap but this time when i saw the picture i thought this band might be the kind that stretches on and you don ' t have to buckle . wrong , but it will do . the band is a bit clumsy to close but i am used to it now and it is fine . i only have one complaint about casio - their documentation . it is tiny and awkward to understand . i am forever accidentally setting an alarm and it takes time to figure out how to stop the daily alarm ! i have gotten used to my watch just periodically beeping at me ! but if you want an inexpensive and very reliable watch , casio is the way to go . 
i gave this to my mum for christmas & she just loves it . i had one of these watches similar while i was growing up . never could find them in the store . they are very durable , don ' t scratch that easy , super easy to use & the battery seems to last forever . 
the product arrived rapidly and was what we ordered . however , the watch band has never stayed clasped . we ' ve taken it to two watch shops and said " we don ' t work on casios . " we said it was just the band and they turned up their nose . obviously , we won ' t be shopping at those shops again . too much hassle and expense to return this item considering the cost , so we ' re looking to replace the band already - - which will cost more than the watch . 
i bought this watch cause it reminded me of the one i had as a teenager . the daily alarm drives me crazy . i can ' t silence the every hour beeping . it ' s great for my niece but not what i was looking for . 
i was ready for something a little different from my trusty timex whose battery had died so i decided on this watch . i do like the look but functionality was lacking . it fit me ok but as others have said , it ' s only for smaller wrists . my wrist measures 6 inches . as others have also said , the end of the band does not want to stay in the keeper and when it escapes , it pokes straight out . the ultimate reason why i sent it back : on the very first day of wearing it , i found it on the floor without even noticing it was off my wrist . luckily this happened at home but i sure would not keep a watch that can just jump off your wrist . i suppose that the end of the band got loose and then was able to work all the way loose . i was just at home doing regular stuff like opening the mail , checking email , etc . the watch is very light and comfortable so its absence from my wrist was not felt . i was very surprised to start to walk into another room and find my new watch laying on the carpet . 
nice piece . it is very slender and works for casual and work wear . i would recommend as a day to day watch . 
it ' s really small and the material is thin , overall , it ' s flimsy . it also seems like a watch for a child . 
it ' s a nice looking watch & the face of it is perfect . but unless you ' re a small child , this watch will not fit you . the band is very short & i can barely hook the 1st hole but if i tried to wear it that way , my hand would fall off due to lack of circulation . only buy this if you have a very tiny wrist . 
probably not fair to give 3 stars . probably didn ' t read specifics well . watch is very tiny - - seems to be for a child 
i have tiny wrists , and i ' m a bit of a minimalist , so i was looking for a simple yet subtle watch . i found this watch about two years ago , and i wore it constantly . it always kept time perfectly . unfortunately , a few weeks ago , i dropped it in my parking lot , and it was run over . however , i was so attached that i promptly bought another one ! 
it ' s a cute watch but you need to have child sized wrists to wear it . i can wear it but if i bend my wrist it ' s super tight and hurts . and i have regular sized wrists . 
i bought this watch - - actually , i almost stole it - - to work in the gardens of our local arboretum where i volunteer . perfect . lightweight , comfortable , and i don ' t have to worry about getting it muddy or scratched . 
selected the item to be gifted to someone who may appreciate the watch . it is reasonably priced and highly recommended to others to purchase . 
nice and small . i have a tiny wrist so this is the first watch that fits me well . good price . 
the strap is so tiny . . jeez . . i dont even know why i expected it to be reasonably ok . . . i had to give out out to smeone immediately i saw it . . i hate it 
since i ' ve very rarely owned a watch at any price level that didn ' t require links removed or set at the 2nd - to - last notch in the band , this casio model is a treat . it ' s nearly child - sized in face / band length . obviously this is not a positive for those disinterested in a low profile watch or with less absurdly dainty wrists . ( but if you ' re used to ' normal ' sized watches on a skinny wrist , it ' s so nice to not see the excess band wrapping around so far that it nearly hits the case . . ) it ' s super lightweight , the numbers , in typical casio fashion are not in a wild font , and it ' s comfortable to wear . it doesn ' t look as cheap as you ' d fear , even with it ' s rubberized band and plastic - y bezel . i struggle a bit when setting it as the crown is almost too tiny ; with long fingernails it ' s tricky ! the face is black so the dial is not as easy to read as its lighter face counterparts . i may have ultimately preferred silver tones to the gold ones offered , but for the price and the desirability of the size , no worries . just beware that if you want a super easy - to - read watch in all lighting conditions or are not aware of the undersized measurements , you could be let down . if tiny and comfortable is your goal , this cannot beat ! i have not had it long enough to vouch for durability , but frankly , at this price point , it ' s not a concern and is as hardy as one could expect . 
the product was smaller that it showed on the site . but it is sturdy and functional . my daughters hands are small so she is in love with it . 
i really like this item because it looks nice and it is perfect for work or being at home . it is all black and that gives it the look of an & # 34 ; expensive & # 34 ; watch , plus casio is a great brand , because i know it will last . and i just paid less than $ 10 ! oh yeah ! 
this is a really nice watch . it is attractive . i bought it for an everyday watch . the band is for a small wrist . but this is a good buy , nice watch . 
very simple everyday watch . it fits neat and blends with my entire wardrobe . love the price suits the quality . i think i made a good choice . 
it fits well on my rather child sized wrist . if you have tiny wrists like i do this is perfect , however it should fit fine on an & # 34 ; average & # 34 ; sized wrist as well . 
i bought this watch because i was trying to avoid a gigantic watch that swallowed my wrist . the previous reviews are accurate - it is small . and by small , i mean tiny . if i knew then what i know now , i would have gone bigger . but it ' s still a functional watch that does what i need . 
i bought this watch because i had a fancy watch already but wanted something casual to wear around the house or out running errands . i wind up needing to wash my hands frequently throughout the day so it also needed to be water proof . this little black watch delivers . it ' s simple yet stylish and looks like it costs more than it did . i ' ve had it a while now and have worn it pretty extensively . around the house , during exercise , in the shower , while washing my hands - - and it still keeps perfect time . often watch bands are much too large for my delicate wrists even on the last hole , but not true with this watch ! it is a perfect fit . it can also be made to fit a fairly large sized female wrist by using the first hole , though if you have lumberjack man - wrists or something this watch probably isn ' t for you . 
reviewed by a family member : i needed an easy to read analog watch with a second hand . since i don ' t like to wear watches , i needed one that ' s comfortably lightweight . this casio watch fits the bill nicely . . . and it ' s cute ! see my photos in customer imagesthis casio watch is certainly not unobtrusive . it ' s a petite casual / sporty women ' s watch with just enough feminine style . pros : small lightweight watch ( case diameter 24mm ) easy to read numeral display with sweep ( second ) handcasio rubber strap contours to my hand comfortably after a couple of daysthe casio watch case is rated ' water resistant ' - so , it ' s waterproof enough to wear while washing your hands or walking in the rainthe watch is powered by quartz movement so , it ' s very accurate . . . i only reset my watch for daylight saving ! although it ' s certainly not g shock tough , this watch is well built and makes a great utilitarian work watch . if you like the feel of a small lightweight analog watch on your hands that ' s simple to use . . . then this casio watch is the one ! ( reviewed by a family member ) hope the review and photos were helpful . . . jeffrey a . ( jeff ) 
this is a very handsome watch and the perfect size . just big enough to see clearly but not all hand engulfing . i have wanted a watch just like it for a long time and have almost not taken it off except to bathe . it keeps excellent time and i am delighted with it . 
excellent watch , my wife loves is small and light but very elegant and can be used on any occasion , my wife is my gratitude for this gift i gave him and he enjoys it to the fullest 
i really like this watch for work and otherwise . it is very water resistant , and i have used a similar one for over a year without any problems . 
i have a small wrist ( 6 & # 34 ; around ) and this watch is the perfect size in both band and face . it keeps accurate time , isn ' t too blinged out , and is sturdy enough for rain , running , and daily life . if you ' re looking for a hardy , functional watch , i ' d recommend this whole - heartedly . 
it is nice mini watch , looks as described , they should add size comparison in the pictures as i was thinking it would be little bigger but for the price is just fine 
i specifically bought this watch to wear while i am working at the hospital . it has a second hand and is plastic - so washable . i didn ' t want to ruin an expensive watch at work . it ' s much smaller than i imagined - so i wouldn ' t get it if your eyesight isn ' t the best . the dial is maybe 2cm in diameter . i , however , love small watches , so this is perfect for me . 
i know that picture shows the image how ' big ' it is but it is way too small . i ' m mid 20th and really not considered fat but this watch is soo small barely fit my wrist . first when i opened i thought that i made a mistake and i bought little girl ' s watch but when i doubled check and it said women i was really disappointing ! cute watch for children and teenagers maybe 
not a luxury watch , but it ' s very practical , is small , the price may be better with relation to the product , but still i like it . 
the body of the watch is a little thick , but at this price , that is to be expected . it is otherwise light , stylish and very comfortable , perfect for my 11 year - old . his only complaint is the lack of built - in lighting . 
this is a very nice watch for the price - - unassuming , reasonably attractive , and accurate . i like it enough ( and it is cheap enough ) that when i lost mine , i bought another . the only thing i don ' t like about it is that the band is pretty short . i can only wear it on the last hole , and it ' s just a smidge tight at that . it is exactly 7 & # 34 ; long when buckled at its loosest . 
this is nice for a simple and casual person . she loves it and very happy to wear it anytime . nice watch 
this is a nice light watch . small but not too small . i just wish the band was a little wider and longer . overall a good deal for the price . will probably buy this brand again . 
i like the looks of this inexpensive watch . very low - profile . i needed something cheap , with a second hand . the only foreseeable problem is the plastic band . it ' s really thin and doesn ' t look like it will last long . 
this is a very basic watch . . . if you just want something simple that tells you the time without any adornments , features or fancy stuff then this is the watch for you . i think though that it is best suited to persons with slim wrists as i actually latch mine using the second to last hole . nevertheless , it was a good bargain . . . let ' s see how well it holds up overtime . 
this is a complete no nonsense kind of watch . . . simple , cheap and rugged . i have had mine for about two years now and it has kept excellent time . as other reviews have pointed out , the plastic type band is okay as far as it goes but i hated the feel . i simply paid about eight dollars for a nice leather band at a local shop and that is working out fine . i use this watch when i am about and about stomping the brush , running , biking and such things . i love the casual look of the thing . i do not mine nice girly type watches and jewelry , but there is a time and place for everything and there are times and places this watch fits in quite well and it did not cost me an arm and a leg . 
i have a tiny wrist and have not been able to find a watch that both fits me and looks like a grown - up watch . this is perfect if you are very petite ! however , for normal - sized people , you might want to look for something a little bigger . : ) 
my wife inherited a 20 year version of this watch and needed another . the face is easy to read . replacing the whole watch was less expensivethan buying a new band ! 
great watch for little money ! 
i thought this was a cheap but fine little every day watch - but the plastic is so smooth it slides when it slides against the opposing side of the band . . in short - it slid out of the & # 34 ; clasped & # 34 ; position and dropped quietly off my wrist while i was out in the world . hope whoever picks it up has better luck than i did . 
i wear this to work and it has endured so much i cannot even count the ways it has been tortured . great value for the money ! 
i really like this watch . it is an every day wear watch , and it is not cheap looking . i saw reviews about it before purchasing and decided to buy anyway . and it is a hit . i also own a movado watch that is similar in dimensions . the watch is also waterproof . . and comfortable . an added treat is that it is solar power . . so you do not even have to reset it . it is easy to forget that you even have it on . i liked it so much i bought another one . 
i bought this watch for a gift , a good brand a nice shape , clear numbers specially for person who can ' t read the small numbers , me and the person who use it now like this watch 
the watch is much smaller than i expected it to be . i like the full face with numbers and second hand , which is why i ordered it . the price was another factor for me , and although it ' s smaller than i wanted , it is still a quality watch . 
it looks like a little kids watch , but i just need for it to tell time . the extra hook that holds the strap slides off all the time and i ' m afraid i ' m going to lose it one day . 
i needed a watch to wear to work that wasn ' t too fancy but still looked nice . i like that it has a black band and a black face . in the photograph , just below and above the face the plastic pieces look quite square , but this is less noticeable in person . overall , i ' m glad i bought this watch ! 
very tiny , i returned it . although it appears a tad larger in the picture , it was not . maybe for a teenager . 
i bought this for my wife as an everyday watch . the black finish of the watch looks cool & the hands contrast well with the black dial . overall a good no nonsense basic watch . 
has a very good look and high quality . when work looks very nice , highly liked by friends and given as gifts . the black look is fantastic ! 
this is a decent watch for the price . it is small which is what i wanted and i can adjust the band as i wear it . the color is also good and will just about go with any thing and will be great for any occasion . i have not worn the watch as yet but i am getting ready to do so . i hope that it will last me for a little time . 
this watch band is for very small people ; way it was too small for my wrist . it is light keeps good time and looks good for a reasonable price . 
for the price , i thank you . i needed something fast and low cost as my work has to be done inside of short time frames and being without a watch was difficult . the band was way too short and i had to ditch that to be able to use it . but my old watch wrist band fit perfectly , so not a problem . 
great little watch that has held up well for the past six months . i use it at work ( i am a nurse ) and for everyday wear . it ' s nothing fancy , but i like the fact that it doesn ' t have jewelry or other pieces that could fall off or get dirty . it keeps time well and i have yet to replace the battery . great watch ! 
i bought it for my daughter , she likes me , is not a luxury watch , but it ' s very practical , is small , the price can be better in relation to the product , but i still like . 
this is a very nice and simple watch . the only problem is that it is so tiny ! i ' m not really a fan of tiny watches but i will wear it since i already have it 
this is like a disposable watch . i mean use it for 1 - 2 years and it is worth it . now a days , using watch is almost like a special occasion thing . people use only cell phones , it is nice to have a real watch and have a reliable source . this watch has been reliable and good . 
this is an elegant watch and looks much better in person than in photos . it is classic and basic , but beautiful in its simplicity and easy readability . it looks good even at black tie functions and could be mistaken for a watch costing 10x as much . keeps time as well as expensive watches . it is thin and light and the band is an extension of the simple watch . the basic black and white theme carries throughout . i do not even know i have it on it is so light . i like casio and timex watches and this one is a real winner . the fact that i can wear it in the shower and it dries very fast is an added bonus . it is water resistent . 
this watch is cheap , but it tells time ! it doesn ' t look good , but the battery has lasted me over a year and is going strong . i use it on vacations and other times when i am not going to have my phone with me . 
it ' s alright . i think it ' s very good but not so excellent . i gave it to my little nephew because it looked age appropriate on him 
although this is technically a man ' s watch , i wear it ( 65 year old woman ) because i wanted a slightly larger size watch than the typical women ' s watch of this same style . it lays flat , is lightweight , is comfortable and most of all , i can easily read the face of the watch . it is water resistant , so it can withstand limited exposure to water ( like washing dishes , etc . ) - - - - - it ' s not fancy - - - - - - just a great all around watch for work , and most activities . 
and for another surcharge , the resin number gives a champagne face and less visible numbers . forget about it . this is the watch . the watch you were born to . the watch to die with . what more can you ask ? clearly visible black numbers on a high contrast white face . the only other things to ask are : will shipping add fifty per cent to the cost ? ( could be , or more ! ) will they ship to a pob or ap or overseas ? ( the proceed to order box will let you know and force you to provide an acceptable address ) how easily may the sweaty plastic band be replaced with a more comfortable cloth woven band ? ( fairly easily if you can remove the original band without removing the band bars ) but this is most definitely the watch that is cheapest and most useful , far more than more refined models . this is all that you will ever need to tell the time , any time . for the rest ( day , date , etc . ) heck , buy a newspaper ! 
easy to see if you need reading glasses ! 
this is a cheap , plain , watch - exactly what i was looking for ! i like the way the band feels on my arm . it ' s so lightweight that i can hardly even feel that i ' m wearing anything . i was surprised by the quality given the price . 
i bought this for a trip to uganda . i just wanted a cheap , workable watch to wear . this fills the bill . 
sometimes these low cost watches last a long time . they work well with the : speidel twist - o - flex & # 34 ; romunda & # 34 ; ( black / ss , 16 - 19mm , straight end ) watch band . most or all of the more expensive watches that i have purchased in the past do not perform any better than these cheapy watches . that is my experience . 
this watch can ' t be beaten for the price i paid . no big functions just three hands 12 numbers and the precision required . 
i purchased this watch simply based upon the reviews and price . it is not what i was expecting based upon the other reviews . first off , this watch will not be mistaken for a " valuable " timepiece . i paid $ 10 and that is exactly what it is , a $ 10 watch . second , the resin band is absolutely terrible . it is uncomfortable and makes my wrist extremely sweaty . it does not , however , pinch hair like my metal bracelet watches . i am going to replace this band with a black timex expedition band , which is a cloth fastwrap style and has proven to be the ultimate in watch comfort ( i prefer the lack of shape and structure the cloth band allows for , or the rigidity of a bracelet . ) the fit and finish of the watch are on par for casio . resin case , standard white face , black hands , black numerals . easy to read even in low light ( no backlighting or glow paint . ) pros : lighteasy to readcheapcons : plastic - y feel ( think " made in china " and although most products are , this has that particularly light and chintzy feel to it ) resin band / case ( the lugs for the band on this can break off ) overall : a decent buy for $ 10 with free shipping . if you like resin bands you will find this watch decent . otherwise , another $ 10 on a decent band and this watch will be acceptable for daily wear , although it will probably end up in the drawer while a $ 50 fossil chronograph rides upon my wrist ( which is a better investment for my needs . ) 
i keep a few of these in my bag on trips in case i lose one . cheap low end casio goodness . 
i know is cheap and not the best design but my father and mother love it , they don ` t really take care of a luxury watch and need big numbers and this watch is exactly what we were looking for . . . . 
i was looking for a good looking , comfortable , analog watch that simply told me the time . no extra features needed . this watch fits my criteria perfectly ! it reminds me of those classic white - faced clocks with black numbers we see in places like schools and hospitals . very utilitarian . they simply tell the time and are very easy to read . it ' s like i ' m wearing a micro version of that classic clock on my wrist . what ( specifically ) do i like it about this watch ? size . it ' s lightweight , thin , and unobtrusive . you forget it ' s on your wrist . simple . no clutter on the face . it tells you the time . that ' s it . easy - to - read face with great contrast . it has big black numbers that stand out , a light ivory background , and black hands . very comfortable band . i like this material . it ' s soft and flexible . when you bend your wrist , it bends with you . no jabbing or stiffness . good looking , minimalist design . the watch is not trying to make a statement . and oh , i almost forgot the price . it was ten bucks ! cons : the band should be longer . it ' s not a problem for me , but as a warning for guys with large wrists , it might not be long enough . i would consider my wrists medium to large , and i ' m down to the third hole from the end . some users have complained that the face is too small . this complaint is more of a personal preference rather than a criticism ( or con ) of the watch . casio does give the face dimensions . i knew what i was getting into , and i have come to prefer this size . i have a very large stainless steel fossil watch that i grew tired of wearing because it ' s obtrusive , heavy , and the band is metal which can be uncomfortable . this is a watch that gets the job done , looks good doing it , and gets out of the way ! 
simple watch . very easy to read dial . was given to my dad who has vision problems so he can see the watch . 
very comfortable . easy to read . a very simple watch for those of us who don ' t want the bling . would buy again . 
i personally love this watch , it is so light , simple and cheap . the battery only lasts about 18 months which is why i give it only 2 stars . . . . . . if it lasted longer i would give 5 . keeps good time . i have owned 3 of these so in the end i really like it , just don ' t like always having to buy a new one . super light , super thin , super easy to readdisposable 
this is a great watch for the budget conscious . keeps great time , light weight and doesn ' t get in the way like those enormous watches out there these days . 
this watch does the trick , but it ' s real small . i ' ve a guy with very small hands , sometimes i pull off unisex watches , and even on me this thing is small . it ' s also impossible to read in the dark . that said , it ' s quite comfortable and thin and unobtrusive , i ' ve successfully swam in it , and so far no failures yet . 
i started collecting this series of casios starting back in 2011 . just replaced the batteries for ( 2 ) watches after almost three years . i think this one is probably the easiest to read especially when you are driving and need to get a quick glimpse of the time . i also heard that the accuracy is superaccurate to within second of the atomic clock in colorado . i can ' t ask for anything better . light , sexy and tough , easy to read and at an incredible price . 
laugh all you want but this is my favorite watch . i have about 15 watches ranging from $ 65 - $ 150 . this watch is actually my favorite and it was $ 5 - $ 8 . i can take it swimming , wear it to the gym , the beach , i can mow the lawn with it , or i can wear it on a plane or a business trip . its a casual looking watch , its super thin , and seemingly weighs nothing . you wont even know it is there and the band does not pull on my arm hair . the battery also outlasted my other watches . its a great watch and i would care less if it smashed into pieces , that ' s the beauty of it . its cheap and its amazing , you could buy a few of them just in case you lose or break one . 
been looking for an inexpensive watch to use at work . the casio mq24 - 7b2 works just right for that purpose . i wanted something inexpensive and that i wouldn ' t mind if it got scratched or broken . the watch is very light and yes , it keeps time . so far happy with the casio watch and hopefully it will last for a good while . 
comfortable fit , glow in the dark features are very vibrant . good looking watch , sharp . not too large , a female could wear this watch . 
i have the black face version for several years - - durable - - only changed the rubber wristband - - great watch for work or dress . . . large case . 
i got this watch off an online website for only twenty seven dollars with shipping included . no box or instructions though . this is a nice watch , but nowhere near as nice as my tag or rolex . two things that could make this watch better are the following : 1 . screw down dial . 2 . rotating bezel with better tolerances . the bezel has a bit of slop and can only be rotated smoothly using two fingers . my two fingers still slip though , because the grip is not good . it ' s nice to have a digital watch now with alarm and hourly chime . i also like the large glow hands and the dual clock feature with military time . i especially enjoy having a watch with a rubber band that i can just slip on and not worry about damaging . although large , it doesn ' t seem bulky or heavy . 
looks a lot more expensive than it is - well worth the price . the gold face is quite attractive and distinctive . keeps good time . i use it as a beater watch - if something happens to it i ' m not going to be out $ 300 dollars . the digital functions are useful without the lcd being too noticable - stopwatch , calendar , etc . the only negative is the bezel - its not as tight fitting as more expensive watches , and its not unidirectional so i wouldn ' t actually use it for diving . one other thing to consider - amazon frequently has watch specials with brands like invicta or seiko . under these specials you can get better watches for about $ 60 - 100 . they won ' t have the functions of this watch , but will be higher quality and last longer . 
i bought this watch many years ago at a service merchandise chain store . anybody remember them ? i found through the years that it goes through batteries at the rate of about one a year , often less if the alarm is used . other than that , the watch is comfortable , accurate , and it an excellent value for the money . my wife accidently threw the watch away while it was on a cluttered desktop about 2 years ago , and i replaced it with one from wally mart , although there it was about $ 75 . 00 . the battery lasted less than a year , in fact it needs one now . 
i just bought one of these watches . it is a nice watch and feels solid and is well - built . the rubber - type strap is decent and i can ' t see anything bad in it . i like all the functions on this watch ( date , alarm , chronograph , diver bezel , etc . , etc . ) . has it all . the metal base or housing piece is solid too . all - in - all a nice , solid watch ( you can ' t of course tell from the web site how heavy the watch is , but it feels more solid than the image might suggest , and to me feels similar to my $ 250 casio dive watch , albeit a not quite as heavy . in other words : perfect for summer , when you want something a bit lighter on your wrist . one thing i noticed is how bright it is in the dark . i pulled into the parking garage and literally said , " wow ! " out loud the first time i saw it in the dark . it has a luminosity that rivals that of my luminox tritium watches . very impressed by that . 
bought it for my boyfriend for christmas . he needed a dressier yet still sporty watch to fit his personality . this is it for sure . he wears gold so the gold shaded face fits in with his other jewelry just fine . he loves it . 
looks good , works well ! great price ! ! ! 
overall the watch is awesome . i do actually use it when diving , though it is only rated as water " resistant " and not waterproof . i can say it holds up to at least 90 feet . the dial is very readable at depth , the digital display however is not . the multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out , even on land . the display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem . very comfortable and functional . 
the casio yellow faced sports watch i just replaced after having one for 15 years ! this one looks and wears as wellas the last one and we ' ll see how long it last ! 
i wrote a full review over on the caveman watch forum , for those interested , but here is a short one , since most people will never even get this far into the reviews . ; ) this watch is of surprising quality for the modest price . you will pay more than a typical casio with the same feature set , because it has a solid stainless steel case , back , and buckle . none of this chrome - plated crap like timex likes to put out these days . although the watch is pretty big , at 45mm diameter , not including the crown , it fits my 6 - 7 / 8 " wrist fine . there are other models that have dial / hands combos that offer better contrast than this one , but this one is a little more dressy and unique , with its gold dial . i ' ve uploaded some of my pix , for your viewing pleasure . update , 2014 - 06 - 24 : this continues to be a great watch . i just changed the battery on it two days ago , and it does seem to last a couple of years . casio has now released a solar / atomic version of this watch , the wva320 , but it will cost substantially more . it also has a dot matrix lcd now , and a nice strong led light that brightly lights up the entire watch face . too bad they still omitted the countdown timer ! buyers should be aware there are now several different color options for this watch . gold dial has a bit of flash , while still looking rugged . there ' s also black and blue dialed - ones , as well as a black - dialed one that has yellow and green markers . note also that there are versions with round and triangular markers ( like this one ) and others with rectangular markers . the luminous material on the hour markers is garbage . they should have used the same lume they used on the hands , which is better than the material that seiko uses on any watch costing less than $ 200 . one other thing casio could do to improve this watch is to raise the bezel just a little , so it ' s high enough to protect the mineral crystal from glancing blows that tend to cause scratches . another thing , probably not cost - effective at this point in time , would be to design the movement so that it sits off to the side , so it would allow the use of a bigger battery . as it is , the movement only takes up about half of the volume of the case . wouldn ' t it be nice to have this same feature set , but with a 10 year battery life ? ( since so many of you are destroying these watches during bi - annual battery changes ; ) ) anyway , this is still a great watch . just don ' t let some ham - fisted person change the battery , and you ' ll be ok . i recommend buying a set of basic watch tools ( $ 8 ) and a decent caseback opener , ( $ 20 ? ) a stereo head mounted magnifier ( $ 30 ? ) and learning to do it yourself . you ' ll save yourself and your family so much money on battery changes . a couple tips , when you put the back and movement spacer back on this watch after a battery change : a ) make sure the tiny gold spring in the middle of the movement sticks up through the movement spacer . if this is not making good electrical contact with the caseback , you ' ll lose all beeping ability of the watch . b ) make sure the two leaf springs also make contact with the caseback . c ) make sure the buttons are behind the nylon springs that are integral with the movement spacer , or your buttons won ' t work either . d ) when you replace the back , make sure it isn ' t cross - threaded in , or you ' ll get it fogged up or drowned . it ' s possible that some moisture comes in through the buttons , but i doubt it , or it wouldn ' t be able to be rated for 100m water resistance . e ) when you replace the caseback lube the o - ring with some " nose grease . " this is your skin oil that tends to build up in the crack of the side your nose , where your nose meets your face . it ' s just enough lubricity to make a good water seal . of course , a tiny bit of silicone grease is preferable , if you have it . f ) plan on replacing that o - ring every 5 - 10 years , to maintain waterproofness . 
great quality watch for a reasonable price . the face of the watch is big , like i wanted , for my 6 ' 5 & # 34 ; husband . the gold face gives this sport watch a little glimmer of class . this is my husband ' s everyday watch , even in the office . 
i have had my watch for about 4 years now and i love the way that it looks and its functionality . it has most features that you might want , but . . . 1 . the strap does come off fairly easily . this isn ' t usually a problem , but i worry about it when i am in the water . it has come off inadvertently about three times since i have had the watch . 2 . the dial is not very easy to see at night or in low light . 3 . the original strap broke , and i replaced it with one that i bought at the mall . most non - metal watch bands seem to be this cheap plastic that eventually will break . i would love to have an actual neoprene strap instead of the cheap plastic ones that are so common . aside from those issues , i have really enjoyed the watch both for its looks and functionality . the yellow dial looks really sharp when you are wearing navy , green , or yellow . the alarm , stopwatch and dual time functions are very useful . i also like the rotating bezel for timing things quickly and easily . i was glad to read the review that said that the reviewer had actually used it for diving to 90 feet . even if a watch is water resistant to 100 meters , it may not be designed for the pressure changes involved in diving , so that figure can be misleading . 
first off , i am not someone who buys watches just to beat the devil out of them . i don ' t wear them in the bath or shower , and i have no intention of wearing them underwater . i treat them with reasonable care and expect them to last a very long time . i don ' t like to spend a fortune on a watch for just a fancy name . up to now i have been mostly wearing seiko kinetic auto - relay watches , but i am sick to death of spending several hundred dollars on a watch that requires no battery but craps out after 3 - 4 years requring a $ 150 repair . what i want is a watch that is reliable , relatively inexpensive , stylish enough to wear at work or when dressed up yet not so prissy that i can ' t wear it casually . this casio watch definitely fits the bill . the photo of this watch really does not do it justice . it is a very attractive watch and has a good size to it without feeling bulky or excessively large on the wrist . the gold face is a really nice touch , and the illuminated hands are very easy to see in any light . the hands illuminate in the dark far better than any watch i ' ve ever owned . i like a watch with analog hands , and the second hand on this one is very precise . the digital portion of the watch can display a separate digital time , an alarm time , or the day & date . in my case , i prefer to use it to display the day & date . it is very easy to set to the precise second if desired . the band on this watch is rubber , which seems appropriate since this watch is advertised to be a dive watch ( it is reported to be water resistant to 100 meters ) . a leather band would have been nicer for a dressier look , but there is only so much one can expect for $ 56 . the band is replaceable , so it is really not a big deal . my only criticism , which is very minor , is the relatively loose bezel around the face . i ' ve never understood why a moveable bezel is needed to display north , south , west , east and 10 - minute divisions , but if one is going to be used it would be nice if it stayed in place when adjusted . this one moves too easily . again , the criticism is minor , and i never utilize this function anyway . if you are looking for a stylish , accurate watch with chronograph features and a reasonably low cost , the casio amw320d - 9ev ana - digi alarm chronograph dive watch is a great choice . if you are looking for a watch to abuse , casio makes g - shock watches for that purpose . 
love this watch . i ' ve got a couple , one in black , one in gold , and i ' m very pleased with both . this is a watch you can like even if analog - digital isn ' t your thing . the design has been around at least since arnold schwarzenegger wore it in ' kindergarten cop ' . it also comes in a blue version with blue bezel . i call this my ' snorkel ' watch . the dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions , so it ' s not for true scuba . . . however i ' ve snorkeled with this down to 20 - 25 feet and no problems , so it ' s definitely waterproof for all non - scuba uses . time adjustment is simple . the luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun , they seem to last about an hour before fading , so they ' re for casual use but not , say , serious spelunking . that said , they ' re easy to read in all light levels against the black . it ' s a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial . the second hand is also easy to read in all light levels . this is a quietly handsome watch at a great price . solid , reliable like every casio , but unpretentious . i ' ve worn mine as a general outdoors sports / beach / knockaraound watch , and it still looks great . the crystal is completely un - scratched despite some pretty careless treatment . i ' m totally pleased with both of mine . check out the white and black face versions as well . this same style series also comes in a three - dial chronograph version which is equally attractive , affordable and reliable . i have a couple of those too . there ' s nothing not to like about this watch . the rubber factory band is fine , but these really look good on a nylon nato strap ( if you ' re not familiar with those , google it ) . i found mine for around $ 30 shipped . prices fluctuate , so do shop around . hope this is helpful . happy times , everybody . 
he wears this watch for everything and not only does it look sexy but its durable super high quality and doesnt scratch easily or need maintenance very great price for an amazing stylish watch . we saw this watch a west marine for 100 $ so the price here is amazing 
dual time zone watches that make sense are hard to find ; this one is on my military wrist daily and has been for three years now . i will buy another . 
one of the last best casio ' s in the market , this watch is a workhorse , is extremly accurate and it give you a lot of extras like dual time , perpetual calendar , alarm and more . it will give better service than a rolex and more accurate . the g shock used to be great but now they have plastic cases , this one still have a stainless steel case , its incredible for the price . probably casio will stop production on this one soon , its too good to be around this days . 
not sure why more people don ' t talk about this knife . it ' s a chronograph with a little screen for stop watch , date , or another time . plus an alarm clock . the dial is a good size . easily visible . the casing is bright and attractive but not flashy . the rubber straps are thick and wide making it tough and making it look tough . doesn ' t get 5 stars because the north / south dial does not sit right on too of 12 , and the glow in the dark is a little too green for me . you can see it during the day and a night it ' s very bright . wish it was a little more subtle . 
i have owned this watch for a little over a month , it not only looks great ( kinda like an omega ) but it is very durable . this watch looks like it cost much more . 
this is a classic casio they been making this watch for awhile cause its such a great watch my friend asked me to replace a very old one that he had same great watch now he has got 3 in different colors 
i have had the 1st generation of this watch since 1994 , on it ' s fifth battery now . could not find many watch repair places with the larger tools to open it until recently . watches this big were not popular in the early 90 ' s . the crystal is indestructable . still getting complements . it is weathering very well , on the third band now . the face is extremely easy to see in most reasonable lighting conditions . if i need a watch with a light i just don ' t wear it at that time . it ' s not high tech . it just works and looks good . 
this watch is tried and true . it is beautiful , functional , and sturdy . the back - issue is inconvenient but not a deal breaker . i ' ve been wanting this watch for years but have waited to the cost was better . wal - mart is $ 68 plus tax , this is a good price as the watch was $ 78 just a few months ago . i recommend this watch . 
no complaints , not too big , comfortable . looks snazzy . priced right . ok . . you can ' t go diving with it . get over it . 
this is truly a very good watch . ability to keep time in 3 time zones ( 1 analog and 2 in digital window ) is helpful . rotating bezel is a live saver when leaving car on metered parking or any time when you are on a tight schedule . it also looks good . i would have liked it better without the compass markings on the bezel , as they are quite useless in a daily life , but clutter the watch face with extra markings . cons : 1 . no back light . really casio ? really ? you give me compass in case i get lost in a wilderness some bright sunny day , but dont give me back light so i can check time in the darkness , that comes to my part of the earth on a daily basis ? 2 . casio makes these solar powered watches with automatic time adjustment based on a radio signal . why not add those nice features to this watch and charge a bit more for it and give us a watch that looks good , functional and never requires batteries or time adjustments ? i would have bought casio ' s solar powered atomic watch , but it has stationary bezel and that was a deal breaker . overal this is a great watch and i will keep it until casio or someone else comes up solar powerd , atomic , anadigital watch with functional bezel . once that happens i will be a happy man . 
wanted a watch that was suitable for virtually every occasion without a hefty price tag . this was exactly what i was looking for . 
this model has been out for a long time . i like the look of the black more then the white or gold . the reason the watch loses one star is because the band . it looks great , but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year . the replacement band that casio offers looks close the orginal , but not exactly the same . i lost one of these , and another was stolen . so the fact that i am on my third is a statement to how much i love this watch . i have been wearing it since about 1993 . 
nice watch for the price seems durable enough since i am hard on watches and it is water resistance for when i ' m fishing i don ' t have to worry about getting it wet . 
love this watch . i ' ve got a couple , one in black , one in gold , and i ' m very pleased with both . this is a watch you can like even if analog - digital isn ' t your thing . the design has been around at least since arnold schwarzenegger wore it in ' kindergarten cop ' . it also comes in a blue version with blue bezel . i call this my ' snorkel ' watch . the dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions , so it ' s not for true scuba . . . however i ' ve snorkeled with this down to 20 - 25 feet and no problems , so it ' s definitely waterproof for all non - scuba uses . time adjustment is simple . the luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun , they seem to last about an hour before fading , so they ' re for casual use but not , say , serious spelunking . that said , they ' re easy to read in all light levels against the black . it ' s a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial . the second hand is also easy to read in all light levels . this is a quietly handsome watch at a great price . solid , reliable like every casio , but unpretentious . i ' ve worn mine as a general outdoors sports / beach / knockaraound watch , and it still looks great . the crystal is completely un - scratched despite some pretty careless treatment . i ' m totally pleased with both of mine . check out the gold face version as well . this same style series also comes in a three - dial chronograph version which is equally attractive , affordable and reliable . i have a couple of those too . there ' s nothing not to like about this watch . the rubber factory band is fine , but these really look good on a nylon nato strap ( if you ' re not familiar with those , google it ) . i found mine for around $ 30 shipped . prices fluctuate , so do shop around . 
no muy contento con el porque no describian el tama & ntilde ; o y yo pense que era como 40 o 41 y resulta que es como 38 . ademas de la temperatura las demas funciones son pura paja . no lo recomiendo 
this is a really fine watch with many features . i ' m surprised that the other reviewers didn ' t realize you have to remove the watch from your wrist to get an accurate temperature reading . i bought this for my son . he sets it outside on the deck for a few minutes to get the temp . he ' s worn it swimming , showering , and other sports activities with no issues . keeps really good time . has a nice feel to it - - quality weight , not cheap or flimsy . i had one link removed by a jeweler . also , he loves the digital and analog read - outs . they have stayed perfectly in synch . 
this watch is very fancy and kind of complicated but i am very happy with this order . i think this watch is a really nice item for the price . 
don ' t buy this grbage . the temp measures the temp on your wrist . comlete waste of money . more problems difficut to adjust 
i purchased this watch as a graduation gift for my son and he loves this watch . the band is a little big but he won ' t get it sized down . he likes everything about it . 
6 yrs and still awesome . had to scavange a new strap . but is my daily watch . . in the pool at the beach , cutting the lawnvery nearly 5 stars 
i purchased this watch to replace another that i had for several years but it stopped working . this watch looks nice but it is made cheap ( that ' s why we pay about 18 dollars in amazon ) . well it was fine but quickly got scratches on the glass and the worse thing was moisture on the glass . i sent it to casio and they returned very quickly but i haven ' t had the chance to test it . if this happens again probably i will throw away and purchase a timex . i updated my review to one since zero star is not allowed . i went to the pool and the watch got moisture in the glass again . so i do not know what they repaired because it is worse than before . 
when i was scrolling through the selection of watches , i came across this watch , and i liked it right off for its looks . even though it ' s a hybrid digital - analog model , it retains a classic , retro kind of look . i think it looks good . and certainly the price is right . but when it came i was dismayed . it is very plastic . it weighs less than a thumbtack ! i wouldn ' t say it feels chintzy . but it doesn ' t have the weight that really good watches have . but rather than write it off , i read its thick little manual booklet , familiarized myself with all of its functions , and started wearing it . it is actually a quite versatile and functional timepiece . and it ' s the first watch i ' ve ever come across that does not have a tiny knob to set the hands with . i didn ' t spot that anomaly until i received it . you push a combination of buttons to set the hour and minute hands . and , surprisingly , the setting and menu system is straightforward and intuitive . it has turned out to be an inexpensive tool i can really put to practical use . countdown timer . stopwatch . world clock . alarm clock . 12 - or 24 - hour display . illuminated dial . no great loss if it ' s lost or stolen . and it does look good , i think , if you can get past the fact that it ' s about 95 percent plastic . once i got used to its featherweight nature , i didn ' t regret buying it . i wear it on rough assignments . it ' s holding up well . in all honesty , i think this watch actually may be the best cheap , plastic watch i ' ve ever owned ! really ! and so i recommend it . it ' s certainly nicer , more useful , and easy to figure out than most of the other cheap watches out there . your mileage may vary , but this watch by casio is doing right by me . 
for the money its very nice . band seems a little cheap but thats the only fault . overall what can you ask for at $ 20 ? its worth the money . 
nice watch , light on your wrist has alarm too ! but very complicated to set still trying to figure out how to set some of the features , telephone numbers ect . the instructions it came with you needed a magnifying glass to read with . the night light to illuminate the watch is useless doesnt light up the whole watch just a little ring of light around the edge of the watch . but overall a not a bad watch . 
cheap quality watch with a cheap price tag . worth every penny if you just need to tell the time accurately plus a few other standard features . 
the pictures don ' t lie . it doesn ' t look bad but when i saw it , it dissapointed me . it ' s not very " shiny " and the hands are not very noticible . a little bit hard to operate . 
pros - 1 ) it cost $ 20 . 36 for a fantastic looking watch . i ' ve already received compliments on it . 2 ) in addition to the analog feature , the watch features a " full " digital menu of options ( alarm , timer , stopwatch ) . 3 ) i like the light because it ' s yellow , and most watches have green lights . . . i think it ' s more pleasing to the eyes . 4 ) easy to set time & date . but , you should read the instructions - briefly - to set the analog time . with today ' s cell phone & " ipod " technology , i ' m not sure who uses a watch " databank " . . . i certainly don ' t . it ' s a bonus feature . i mostly bought the watch for pro # 1 listed above . con - 1 ) no second hand , but the digital portion ' s seconds replaces the need for one . still , i think it would look better with a second hand . well , i hope this helped . happy shopping ! : - ) 
great looking , was trying to buy one inexpensive watch for outdoor activities . the visor is not scratch - proof but is very good looking and great watch . 
this is a cool watch for the price . i ' e had it close to a year , and little to no signs of wear . still carrying accurate time . if your looking for an economical time piece then this is the one . 
no where can you get a watch with a ten year battery and water proof to a hundred meters . also has stop watch and a timer and twentyfour hour digital time and world time for any major city in the world 
good ! 
great watch , good looks ! the only problem i have is the fact that the light doesn ' t illuminate the date , stopwatch , etc . . . electroluminescent displays are wonderful things , unfortunately they must be difficult to back - light . other than that i would buy it again in a heartbeat . i spend that much on friday night pizza which lasts all of ten minutes in this household . . 
i didn ' t get this for its functions . in fact my fingers are too large to even push these tiny buttons . setting the time etc . . . was difficult . the first one i received was broken and i had to exchange it . this one works and it has a cool look to it . 
this is a very cool watch and i am so glad it is still out there . the watch has the buttons right on the face to start calculating which is perfect for any fellow that loves to do math and likes & # 34 ; gadgets . & # 34 ; i can ' t tell you what else it can do because my son , now age 26 , is the one that owned several over about a ten - year span and he set the time on the one i recently bought as a gift for my grandson , now age 12 . i know the casio databank calculator / watches he owned each lasted for years of daily use by a very active young man . i believe having that calculator on his arm further stimulated his love for math as he found many reasons to use it . i ' m almost positive this watch holds other information and that you can store phone numbers in it which can be real reassuring and practical for a youngster , to know they have information at their finger tips . let ' s see , what else can i tell you ? the band is pretty adjustable , soft , no rough edges to catch on hair or other things , it ' s quite comfortable to wear . 
as for me , being a & # 34 ; dinosaur & # 34 ; and & uuml ; ber geek / nerd from the 80 ' s , this is the perfect watch ! i had one of these back then and i am happy that casio ' s calculator watches are still available . i wish they were made in japan and not in china but i could not see any quality flaws compared to the vintage japanese versions . the case has the right size , the strap is super soft . you don ' t feel this watch on your wrist and it is flat enough to not snag with your shirt ' s sleeve . the calculator works perfectly well - no problems with pushing the buttons , the alarm is surprisingly loud . i am in the watch business and i have certain testing equipment at hand . i have tested the watch for it ' s water resistance and it passed a combined 0 . 2 bar vacuum and a 2 . 0 bar pressure test but that doesn ' t mean it should be used for water sport activities . it means that it will easily survive any accidental contact with water , sweat or dirt . accuracy : the watch was timed to + 0 . 44 seconds per day ( = 13 sec / month ) and since the module has a trimmer , i was able to improve the accuracy to + 0 . 18 seconds per day ( = 5 sec / month ) at body temperature so now this watch beats any overpriced ( prone to magnetism and shocks ) swiss luxury watch by far ! the 3 volt lithium battery usually lasts for approx . 5 year depending on usage of the alarm feature . and you won ' t get mugged for this watch so wearing this watch actually contributes to your health ! and if someone is making fun of you for wearing a geek watch just tell them & # 34 ; the geek shall inherit the world - one day you will work for me & # 34 ; ! haha ! go and order one for yourself as long they are available - you will be happy with it ! : ) 
i got this for my 8 year old son . he ' s kind of a math nerd , so he really digs this watch . he ' s also learning karate , so don ' t make fun of the watch , or you might get a chop to the throat . 
i guess i got the measurements wrong with this item , but when it came in , it was pretty dingy . the watch face is really small , there is no light option , and reset bottom seems like it ' s falling off when trying to hold down . overall the concept is cool , i like the retro 1980 ' s kick back to the watch , the calculator seems easy to use , just keep in mind the buttons are pretty small , but considering the watch / calculator combo , it ' s not bad . pros - - - - - - - - seems durable , but pretty small , and looks a little " girly " on a bigger dude like mecalculator is a nice option , especially being in the medical fieldcons - - - - - - - - - no light that i can findreset button is not durablevery flimsy and small 
this is exactly what it looks like . a calculator that also tells the time . my husband was ecstatic to get this . it was his favorite thing to get for christmas . he wears it every day and actually uses the calculator . i laugh when he does this but it ' s a great watch . similar to the one in breaking bad so i guess it ' s good for a big brba fan . : d 
casio men ' s ca53w databank calculator watch . module no . 3208 . one of the things that i really like about this plastic watch is that it is very light in weight at 0 . 3 ounces . casio makes a lot of fancy watches with as many functions as a swiss army knife , but they also weigh as much as a swiss army knife . i would not wear a big , heavy , clunky watch , no matter how fancy it is . i do not need a weather station , compass , and altimeter on my wrist or shirt pocket . some of these fancy watches really overdo things in terms of what i really need . at $ 14 . 97 , this watch is pretty much in the disposable range when it comes time to replace the battery in five years . i tried to replace the battery on one of these watches , but the flimsy rubber water seal broke when i removed the back , and i do not know where to get a replacement rubber seal . so , i broke down and spent $ 14 . 97 ( including shipping ) to get a new watch . this watch is handy , but the calculator numbers are very tiny , and the calculator functions are printed in dark red against a black background , making them impossible to read except under a bright light . my ability to read small numbers and symbols is fading , so i may have to get a different model calculator watch with more visible numbers and functions that may not " look adult " , but who cares , as long as i can read it . this watch will be on the back of my clip - on glasses case anyway , held on by a couple of heavy rubber bands under the clip . i have been using this casio model for years , and except for problems replacing the battery , i have not had any other problems with it . one thing i would like casio to add is a button and light for the display . casio computer co . , ltd . , 6 - 2 , hon - machi 1 - chome , shibuya - ku , tokyo 151 - 8543 , japancasio . com / products / watches / 
i just got this watch and its a fun to wear nerd watch for not a lot of money . if you like nerd watch , you can ' t go wrong with this one . - the watch is light weight and the strap is comfortable to wear . - in time keeping mode , you need to press the " divide " button to see the date . i kinda wished that the date is shown as default . - the chronograph will * beep * every 10 min . it will count up to 24hr but you need to press the " divide " button to check the elasped hours . - i don ' t think i will be using the calculator function heavily . it works , but its not a scientify calculator . - not a lot of calculator or databank casio watch with keyboard is water resistant , but this one is . its nice to know that you don ' t have to worry about the watch when you are washing your hands . - no back light ! i kinda wished that it has one . - not all settings are easy to find . e . g . to set the time from am / pm to 24hr , in time setting mode , you need to hit the " + " button ; to set the button beep on and off , in calculator mode , you need to hit the " adj " button . - drilled lug hole is a nice touch . i like it cause its easier to change strap with that . 
i haven ' t worn one of these for 20 years but i wanted one just for old time sakes . i can ' t believe how cheap this watch is for all the functions . for $ 13 , you get a time , calculator , alarm , stop watch and timer . the only thing that this model does not have is backlight but for $ 13 , you get all of these other functions ! 
my son wanted this to help with math . he loves it . the data storage feature is a little outdated , but usable if you have the patience for it . 
just a note that this does not have a backlight other than that this is a perfect item for any chinld of any age , built to last and built well . 
i love this watch . i can do calculations on it , though the buttons are small . i wish it had a light so i could see the time at night though . 
girls will ask you why your watch has a " keyboard " on it , a perfect conversation starter where you can begin to correct them that this is indeed a genuine calculator watch . my girl actually hates this watch but i love showing it off when it ' s time to calculate exactly 15 % for my tip at the restaurant . i figure it will easily pay for itself after the couple of meals i would have over - tipped had i not had this exceptional timepiece . true , it has no backlight , but how often do you really check the time in a cave ? it is water resistant enough to keep out sweat and sink water from hand washing ( if you ' re into that sort of thing ) . it has dual time and an alarm but i never use those functions . i synced it with my dw - 5600e g shock that keeps perfect time and after 3 - 4 weeks this calculator watch is running about 5 seconds slower , which is common for this watch and not too bad as far as accuracy goes . the only real con is since i started wearing it people keep asking if i can fix their computer ? weird . otherwise i think it ' s a nice classic watch for the price . 
i saw a friend recently with a similar calculator watch , and to be honest , i had to copy him . i always wanted one as a kid , and my older brother had one , making me crave on even more . when i found out they still make these suckers i had to jump on the opportunity . so far the watch works wonderfully , and i have no doubt it will last for years . if i had to complain about anything with this watch , it would be lack of water resistance , and lack of a light . . . but i knew of these before purchase , so i can ' t hold it against the watch . overall , it is wonderful , and i get more compliments on this watch then on some of my other much more expensive watches . 
i bought this for my husband . he absolutely loves it . he had a similar one back in the 80 ' s . i think this is better than any of the smart watches . 
this is a basic calculater watch that offers quick access to the time , a calculator , a stop watch and another time zone time . for travelers , the last part is very hekpful if you want to land and immediately adjust to the current time . of course having a calculator on your wrist may not appeal to everyone , but i need it . it works well and has solved many problems when running around at the hardware store . a stopwatch is a runner ' s or as in my case , a walker ' s fruend . 
i got this for my husband to wear for an 80 ' s theme party , but then my 7 year old started wearing it all the time . he even figured out how to use the calculator by himself . 
all respect for dbtimeno joke ! they give 1year warranty on all products they say to heck with the man a factors warrantys . phone number and fast reply to emails i ordered this watch but returned this because it ' s to small for me my wrist size is 9 too big . 
i just turned 34 today . i had been surfing and apparently raving that i had to get one of these . i have wanted one since i was 7 years old . the slightly nerdy kid in my 2nd grade class had one , and i was green with envy . every few years , i would notice casio is still making this watch , and every time , i thought to myself : " nah , not enough features . " or " nah , electronic watches are boring . " ( i ' m a watch idiot savant , or wis for short . i normally like mechanical watches ) anyway , i had a couple of beers last night and was raving to my wife that i need to get one of these . i had waited 27 years , and that is quite long enough . back then , this watch was a relatively new design . it was only 3 years old . in those days , casio didn ' t come out with new designs every week like they do now . so today , she surprised me with this . when i look at it , i am transported back to 1983 in 2nd grade , and i remember how envious i was of nicholas , who had this watch and was all stoked about going to see ' the return of the jedi ' . enough of my sentimental rambling . that is not why you ' re reading this . ( if indeed * anyone * is reading this . . . ) i will review this from the standpoint of an electrical engineer and owner of 4 other casio watches . i ' ve had countless others , but i ' m down to 5 now . ergonomically , this watch could not be any better . looking at the black resin band , you might think that it sticks to the wrist . it does not , because casio put cut - outs in the strap up near the watch body . the band is soft and pliable . compared to modern casio digital watches , it does not do much . the main screen includes time of day and the day of the week . the next screen is the calculator . the next screen is the alarm . ( no hourly chime , that ' s how old this design is ! ) the next screen is dual time . the next screen is stopwatch . then , we go back to the main screen . no countdown timer , no moon phase , altimeter , barometer , thermometer , not even a micro - light . ( micro lights are the tiny incandescent that were barely adequate to light up the display to read the time . micro - lights predate illuminator and electro - luminescence . ) however , the result is that the screens are not cluttered with junk . there aren ' t weird symbols , the meaning of which one would need to consult the booklet . you might look at the funky way the rubber buttons protrude up through the watch body . don ' t laugh too hard . these are much easier to press than those of later casio calculator watches . later models were made to be more water resistant , so they had to seal up the keypad and use membrane - type buttons . i have one such later model , a dbc - 150 . ( databank calculator , 150 telememos ) it has more features , including a nice backlight and a countdown timer . but the calculator buttons either require a fingernail or a very hard press with the tip of the finger . not the trusty ca53w - 1 ! a normal press with a fingertip is all it takes . the ca53w - 1 is also not bristling with buttons from the sides like later model casios were . just one metal button protrudes , and the recessed metal button for ' adjust ' . less buttons to catch on clothing and accidentally press . the time is set through the use of the numeric keypad . the stopwatch is also controlled by this keypad . the face of the watch boldly advertises : ' water resist , alarm chrono , wr ' . a word more on ' water resist ' . if a depth is not given , then this means it is resistant to splashes , such as one might encounter in a light rain or a random drop or two from washing one ' s hands . it is not designed to be submerged . others reviewers have indicated that they ' ve submerged their ca53w - 1 with no ill effects , but i ' m not going to risk it . i ' ll take my dw - 5600e g - shock for that kind of duty . also worth mentioning is that this watch is significantly thinner and shorter , than later calculator watches . it is literally 30 % smaller than my dbc - 150 . it is so light , one doesn ' t even realize one is wearing a watch . the bottom line is that for someone who has the right kind of fashion sense , this is a better watch to have then a rolex ( i have one ) or movado . it makes a certain statement , and that statement is : " i am all about practicality . i am an unapologetic geek . take your trendy , blocky - for - no - reason , ashton kutcher - esque kenneth cole watch and take a long walk on a short pier . " one last tidbit of info . when i set the date on my watch , the earliest year was 1980 . happy 30th birthday , casio calculator watch . 
i bought this for my boyfriend because his old one broke . he absolutely adores it . : ) works perfectly and is very practical 
i must say i was pretty stoked to order this guy even before i got it , but i will make this a fair review . i work in a industrial area so i like cheap watches that i don ' t have to care for and will break off my wrist in an emergency . i lost my last cheap work watch which was a timex as i have stuck to them for year . i happen to see this one on the amazon webpage right next to the timex i was going to purchased . there is always a shortage of calculators at my work , and i needed a new watch . i solved both issues at once . the normal display is just pm , hours , minutes , seconds and day of the week as seen in the pictures . the main function or menu bottle is on the side which allows you to scroll between functions . the functions in order from the main time are calculation , alarm , the dual time , and stop watch . the calculator can do addition , subtraction , multiplication and division . it claims to do powers , but really you hit " 3 " " x " " x " " = " to do 3 ^ 2 and " 3 " " x " " x " " = " " = " for 3 ^ 3 and so on . the alarm is just like any other watch , and it only has one alarm . no dual alarms here . it is nice that the alarm on / off is an actual button rather than having to press and hold a button . the dual time just keeps a separate time in case you need to know the time in another time zone . lastly , the stop watch works very basically with start / stop and lap / reset . the watch band feels great , the rubber quality appears much better and softer than the timex watches , but then again timex watches you can drop all you want and they keep going . only time will tell if this watch has similar durability . pro : - fun nerdy watch - functional basic calculator - fits comfortably - high quality band for rubber - dual time - stop watchcons : - buttons are small - no dual alarms - no real powers function - thin band for questionable durabilityoverall 5 stars as this is a fun , functional watch at a great price . 
i bought a calculator watch once before from timex . i was reasonably happy with it , except that it would beep with every button press , which there was no way to turn off , and that it was lacking in some of the other features of a digital watch which are common . this has all of the above . i do tips in my head , but it ' s great for figuring taxes and unit pricing , and you ' d be surprised how much more calculating you find yourself doing when you have a calculator so close at hand . it ' s also great to have a stopwatch and calendar , too . because this watch has a full complement of buttons , it ' s much easier to operate than something like an f - 91w , and it ' s much less prone to accidental resets of date and time . features are also fewer button presses away , although the buttons are quite small and require a bit of dexterity . it ' s also waterproof , which is what ended my timex calculator watch . the only thing missing is a backlight , which i rarely use . were i to need that , i ' d just got o my phone for the time . 
this is an old fashion watch if you want just a watch nothing special this is the watch for you wear it to work and you can wear it outdoors , for rugged activity and you want a g - shock look without paying the g - shock price like i do then buy this watch . i love g - shock but not going to pay that price ! if you feel the same way then buy this watch , if you just want watch no glam or glitz buy this watch great value for the price ! 
great watch at this price , no its not a g - shock ; but it dose fit and function like one . band is very nice for a cheap watch , i do wish the buttons were less exposed but i can live with it . good illumination , easy to set , great water protection . 
for my point of view this is one of the best watches that ever saw , the relation ship between price and conform is perfect . . . . just is a good desition 
this is a bargain for the price . 20m water resistance and a nice set of basic functions - nothing fancy here . granted , it is not a g - shock - but the watch feels pretty sturdy for the price . the resign band is not the best - but at this price point - i can ' t complain . the real appeal of this watch is to the nerd in all of us from years ago . the rock - boost style push buttons on the bottom of the watch , the odd shaped display - it brings you back to a simpler digital watch time . no moon phases or tide graphs here . no compass or barometers - just simple time telling in a digital way . a little trivia item - this was the exact model watch tom cruise wore in the first mission impossible movie . don ' t know why they didn ' t spring for a true g - shock - but if it was good enough for ethan hunt - well than at this price , it is good enough for me as well ! 
if this passed tom ' s taste way back in 1991 ( mission impossible 1 ) then u don ' t know what u r missing if u don ' t have this . this is my favorite casio everyday watch out of the over 50 watches i have bought . 
good enuf for me . best pre - g - shock watch ever ! cmon man if u like gshock , u gotta have this ! u dont have this . u no gshock fan at all . 
i have had 5 - 6 casio dive and g shock watches since 83 , i fell in love with the g shocks , but when my last one died ( dw 6600 ) casio discontinued it , and i wanted something the same but lighter , and the dw 290 fits my needs , and the price was great . i would recommend this watch for anyone who wants something sporty , waterproof , durable , dependable , and wont get knicked up . i know this one is not quite as tough as my gshocks , so as a result i always keep that in mind as to how i treat it . but i dont baby it either . for $ 26 and free shipping , you cant go wrong . i have had it 9 months so far and it works excellent . when i need a battery , walmart has them for $ 3 , including changing it for me ( no charge ) . casio makes alot fancier ones than this , but i bought this one on purpose , because it has exactly what i need and no more . i am very happy . 
pros : 1 ) it only cost me $ 24 . 2 ) it ' s comfortable . this watch will fit a wide range of wrists ! 13 holes in the band for your fitting pleasure ! 3 ) it ' s not a g - shock . . . but it possesses many functions ordinarily carried by one . i . e . alarm , timer , stopwatch . and it seems fairly strong . . . not likely to fall apart for at least a few years . 4 ) cool feature - time continues to display during timer & stopwatch modes . 5 ) green & # 34 ; electro luminescent backlight & # 34 ; sufficiently lights watch for 1 . 5 seconds . ( i timed it for ya ! ) cons : 1 ) while using the timer or the stopwatch , one must & # 34 ; reset & # 34 ; using the upper - left hand & # 34 ; adjust & # 34 ; button which is recessed ( and on most watches reserved strictly for adjustments of settings ) . for instance , the watch wearer needs to press & # 34 ; adjust & # 34 ; to & # 34 ; zero out & # 34 ; the stopwatch . i dunno . . . it ' ll be especially awkward especially if you ' re a track / swim coach , or someone who often uses those features . well , i like it ! ! but , i have 25 other watches too , most of which i also like . this carries all the traditional functions of a casio watch . thank you for reading this . . . hopefully it helped . ask any questions . . . i ' m pretty good about replying within a day or two . happy holidays ! ! ! : ) 
my son is quite satisfied with this watch ; the price was very good , which is what attracted me to this product . for the value and features it is unbeatable . his old watch had a broken wrist band , so this was an adequate replacement at least as good as his old timex watch . 
this watch is fantastic for the price , i might even go as far to say unbeatable in the > $ 40 category . i purchased this same model back in the early 90 ' s and i just now replaced it with a new one . pro ' s : - durable - large buttons - easy to navigate and set - handsome - very comfortable - super bright el light - count down timer - long battery lifecon ' s : - plastic buckle / clasp for the band . honestly , metal can ' t be expected at this price though . - light green print on the watch case wears off . i wish it were recessed and printed with the same color so it wouldn ' t wear off as i think it looks great . this watch is g - shock caliber for 1 / 2 the cost . the only thing about it that doesn ' t make it a true g - shock is the lack of a metal clasp on the band , but it is still sturdy regardless . it is comfortable to wear all day , in all activities , and all weather . i put my last one through hell and it is still working perfectly , even after two battery replacements and a couple band replacements . if you need a durable watch at a great price , look no further . this is the ticket . 
i have always loved casio watches . i have collected several over the years . i have worn the g ' s quite a lot . let me tell you though that this dw290 is one my favorite casios . this model is old school cool . it has a great wrist presence with a nice clear display . the numbers are easier to see than on other more expensive models for some reason . the screen is not cluttered with useless graphs and flashing nonsense . for this price there is no way you can go wrong . it will give you years of service . a big , muscular , retro , monster ! 
casio makes a solid watch that will lest 8 - 10 years . this is one of the basic levels with a decent price . the nymbers are big . illumination is good . easy to use with date in both 12 and 24 hour , date , stop watch and alarm function . 
i bought this to replace a dw5600 that i lost . great watch that is almost as rugged as the dw5600 and much cheaper . this watch is simple and easy to use and easy to read . the menu is a no brainer . i actually like the band on this watch better than the one on the dw5600 . it seems a little more pliable and is more comfortable to me . i also like that the buttons are a little larger and easier to press . some people don ' t like that but i guess its a personal preference . i like the shape better than the round or square g - shocks . i don ' t know why , maybe its just different . the red line about the glass is kind of nice too . i do wish casio would start putting slightly larger digits in their displays though . i ' m getting older and the eyes are not as good as they used to be . 
2009 - i love it , its better than i expected , light and shiny . . . i still cant believe how cheap it was . . . go for it ! ! ! 2012 - update : i bought this watch 3 years ago . . . and wow , it was a long run . . . today it stopped working , i dont know if its the battery or may be it just broke ' cause i used to drop it alot . . . the point is , it really handled lots of things for a 30 dollar watch . i highly recommend it ! ! ! unfortunately , wont be repairing it anytime soon so im switching to invicta . loved this watch and will miss it a lot : ' ( 
just the right size . i don ' t like the big clunkers that people are wearing these days . i have a big wrist , and this band just fits perfectly . i like the blue dial and the clear face . i had a similar one from a different manufacturer ( more expensive ) but i actually like this one better . 
this is a great valued , good - looking watch that keeps accurate time , but the crystal is a bit convex - shaped , so it looks a bit like a magnifying glass , i would ' ve preferred the crystal to be flat . . . also beware of the band as it was impossible to adjust without scratching & denting the band at a few small spots as i was re - sizing it myself ( i resized other watches myself including another casio watch w / o such trouble , think it ' s due to the large angulation of the individual links on this watch that makes it so hard . . . ) guess a jeweler w / better tools should be able to re - size this watch properly . . . 
this watch replaced my tissot pr50 , a $ 250 watch . this casio is more than comparable to such a pricey watch . what you get for $ 30 is simply too good of a deal . this casio is classy yet functional . 
the watch arrived after 7 days since i placed the order , the reason for the delay is because i used free shipping . the looks of the face of the watch is really impressive , however the steel band has a cheap feel to it . the steel strap is not brushed and has some sharp edges to it . i had to spend $ 5 at the jeweler to adjust the steel strap . i usually wear it on mondays since it has the blue face . monday blues i guess . 
simply beautiful , it looks beautiful , strong and elegant and resistant to the water 100 mts , i really feel good wearing it 
this everyday watch looks great for the price and keeps great time . i like the bracelet snap closure , as the friction type always gets loose over time . the only negative is how hard it is to remove links from the bracelet . there are much easier ways to do this with other brands but this maker chose this clumsy method as it obviously costs less to make it this way . took me an hour to remove 2 links and i am tool - handy . very aggravating . i suggest that you have a jeweler do it for $ 10 - 15 . i also suggest that all buyers get a jeweler ' s rouge cloth to keep the watch shiny and looking like new . i also clean all my watches with a cotton tip and rubbing alcohol every few months to remove dirt and skin oil . a bit of polishing after and they look new forever . 
i purchased this product based on the image shown . . . i found the quality is compromised and for the same price , a better watch can be purchased . . . . 
great watch for $ 31 . 00 . keeps perfect time , 10 - year battery life , looks like a $ 200 . 00 watch , waterproof for swimming , car - washing , showering , and snorkeling to 28 feet at least ( that ' s as deep as i have been with this watch on ) . looks great for formal or casual wear . great deal from casio & amazon . 5 stars from me . 
i brought this watch because i want something that has alarm , timer , and i want something between analog and digital . i have a timer analog watch but it timing was not easy to read down to the second because of the analog hand . so i was looking for something with digital . first i though i was going to have to pay for more than $ 100 dollar for something like this . then , i saw other 30 and 20 dollar casio wrist watch with thermometer , i know i have to get one of those two watch . but when i look closely at those watch , i saw that their appearance tell their extract price . then i saw this one for 50 dollar and it does look like a hundred dollar watch . for me , everything work perfectly , that included thermometer , i just had to calibrate as it written in the manual . first , all the buttons and setup really confused me but after i read manual and followed the instruction . it worked fine , after i change my utc time zone to correct one , it even show my home town , which is half way around the world in one of the most remote place , time correctly in wtc time . i have a small hand so i had to take off 5 clips off the bracelet but it was easy and now it fit like it makes for my tiny wrist . work great for me . 
really look ' s great and work ' s like you hope a casio watch work ' s , best quality and good look watch , really i reccomend . 
my husband likes the watch . it ' s great with all its features but when it came in you can hardly see anything on the face . it ' s just dull . i had to turn on the backlight in the afternoon to see the digital time . 
this watch is much more than i expected , has all the functions you want and it is very nice . size is perfectly in line with my arm and looks very elegant . the best 
the watch looks nice and unlike some i got an accurate temp reading . the digital information is too little and the light is too late . the size of the info is small and not clear for old eyes . the lighted version of the display is only on for a very short time making viewing difficult . some ( with young vision ) should love this watch , however be cautious if you have difficulty reading small displays . 
this is an attractive timepiece that can give much more information than just the time in both a digital and an analog format . the list is too long to list here but ranges from the temperature in f , or c . to the time in any city in the world but be prepared to a challenging array of button pushing to programing or setting any of the functions . i am personally fascinated with it and it quickly zoomed to be one of the favorites in my collection 
when a child wearing this watch feels good to give exact prices go very low hopes it can be a little longer battery 
this watch was bought as a gift and it is really very beautiful . it has so many cool features as well . great buy ! 
the band is just rubbery plastic but it is so light it ' s hard to remember i have it on . the beep for the alarm and for the on the hour beep which i have turned on are so light and fast no one one it but you . i love this watch and for the money - it can ' t be beat . 
i work in the public schools . i love the automated countdown timer . in just two fast clicks i can tell children they have three minutes until they are done . i also use it to pace my chores at home . in five clicks i return to check the laundry . . . which is an automated timer for 15 minutes . 
i am pleased with this digital watch . the only other feature that i would like to have is the auto timing with the colorado time center . 
i have had several of these . i have changed the battery before , but i find it is just easier to get a new one . considering the price , getting a new one is no problem . i am loyal to this watch because it is so useful . it is digital and has a stopwatch , with is key for running . it is water resistant - so i would not recommend swimming with it . however , i just leave it on the edge of the pool and that works fine for me . one of the best features is the timer . by just pushing a button a few times , you can time several different time intervals . this is most useful for cooking when you have multiple dishes cooking . perhaps the best feature is the size . the face is smaller than a quarter . most watches are huge and a pain to wear - but not this one . 
i have had a couple of these watches over probably 20 years . they are the best . they are not fancy at all ; in fact , i wish they had ones that were a little more dressy . however , the 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 minute easy to set timer makes it great for teaching , remembering to do something . they last forever , it seems , with battery changes infrequently . i was even able to replace the band . 
i have used this style watch for many years . i would be lost if they stopped making it . there have been times when it has been hard to find , but now is readily available . thank goodness . i finally learned to use a pencil end to use its & # 34 ; buttons & # 34 ; , which are very tiny and sharp - - and i have a low threshold of pain . now the watch is perfect in all respects . 
as a diabetic , i need to eat a little something every three hours and thought this watch with an alarm would be better than my iphone alarm . wrong . . . . . not only is the dial so small that you need a magnifying glass to see what it says , worse you cannot hear the alarm tone , even when we are in the house and it is quiet . sure wouldn ' t work in a store . i set the calendar but inadvertently transposed the day and date and after fiddling with it for over an hour , gave up and am sending it back . i bought another polder clock / timer and i can see the time and hear the alarm and it counts up . i ' d pass on this casio and look at the polder timer . 
i bought this to use for work , as it is not expensive and my job might damage a watch by scratching it . it keeps good time and was easy to adjust . the band is perforated along its length and wrist size is easy to match , though plastic is not the most comfortable band to wear in warmer weather . have not tried the alarm function as i don ' t need that . it ' s a good basic , inexpensive watch that does what i need , and i would recommend it for anyone who needs to keep time without spending a lot of money . update : i wasn ' t using the alarm function or any other function except timekeeping , so i was surprised to hear a tiny beeping that i couldn ' t seem to shut off . had to find the instruction manual to figure out the buttons , which are very tiny and the indicators on the face are hard to read without a magnifying glass . if these drawbacks aren ' t bothersome , it is a good watch , keeps time , is inexpensive enough for everyday wear . 
the good : this watch is simple ( just 2 buttons for operation ) and has some convenient features . i use the quick timer the most ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 30 minute settings ) . it also has a stopwatch function , which is is also useful . the rubber strap feels durable and i haven ' t had a problem - - though you might get a bit sweater underneath the band . it ' s perfect for work at the hospital / clinic or school - - i don ' t have to rely on my phone for the time . i ' ve had it for over a year and the battery is still good . the bad : should this thing run out of battery , i feel like there ' s no way for me to replace the battery without risking breaking it - - i might buy a new one instead of just replacing the battery . 
simple , easy to use and see . just what i wanted for running . also price is very reasonable , considering i have lost 2 of them . this time i ordered 2 . only problem with this watch is the display does not light up and the loop on wrist band does not stay in place . 
i have gotten this model of casio for years . it is inexpensive and has some nice features . i like the alarm that you can set for 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 minutes . and it has a timer that i use on my walks that has a stop - start feature , so i can keep track of actual walking time . i originally got it because i am allergic to nickel alloys and this watch has no metal except the stainless steel backing . the appearance is certainly acceptable as well . 
this is a great digital watch with a lot of neat features ( stopwatch ) . it ' s small and delicate which is a perfect fit for me . i recommend it ! 
when my children were toddlers i had this casio watch . i used the stopwatch and the timers for everything from " 15 minutes more of play " to 10 minutes in time out for one . i loved this little watch . it was faithful , accurate and kept on ticking no matter what . it is water resistant - which i accidentally tested several times . like several other reviewers have said - usually when i bought a new one it was because the band broke or i lost it . i was unable to find them in stores in recent years , even though i asked . no one seemed to have heard of them . then i found it on amazon and ordered it . hurrah ! i love it . as before it is great . my only concern is i have gained weight over the years and with my fat wrist it is only able to hook on the very end . but that ' s my fault - not the watch ' s . i appreciate things that are made with quality , and this is one of them . i have wasted money trying to find a watch that keeps running and lasts . this one does . they even have a similar one with a metal band for dressier occasions . update - i bought this in sept . 2012 . it is now july of 2013 and this little watch is still going strong . there are some things that are still well made . : ) 
i ' ve been wearing this watch since 1987 ! ! ! it ' s not what i would call cute , but it ' s great - very functional . has a unique timer setting - the easiest / fastest timer setting on any watch that i ' ve ever seen . and it ' s not too big , unlike most of the sports watches out there that have similar functions . i ' m on at least my fourth , maybe fifth one of these watches . i change out the batteries when they wear out ( usually about 2 - 3 years ) , and only buy a new watch when the band breaks ( which happened twice - but it lasted at least five years ) or when i ' ve lost it . i hope they never stop making it ! 
i ' ve had the same version of this watch for over 5 years and i cannot get tired of it . it is light and comfortable and still has all the useful features . i work as a researcher in a science lab and i got rid of my timer for most experiments . i also use it as an alarm every morning without waking up my husband with a heart attack . i love this watch and i would hope that you can change the battery when it dies . but as long as they keep making the watch , i guess it ' s ok that the battery is not replaceable . 
i am so glad casio still carries this watch because i have three people who love it . it is sleek , feminine , and simple . the price is great and it arrived on time and in perfect condition . these watches hold up well to wear and tear . 
if you want a fuss - free watch at a bargain price , this is it . i am grateful to the other reviewers for recommending it . it is light weight , never a bother , keeps excellent time and at this price i think i can discard it when the batteries die ( estimated at 2 years ) . i still need to read the directions ( which are adequate but not terrific ) to change the time - but that is only necessary at daylight changing times ! considering the price it has many features , like alarms and date functions but i just like a dependable inexpensive watch . 
i have been losing and rebuying the watch for years ! stays on in the shower and swimming and being able to instantly set an alarm for 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 minutes has dramatically increased my productivity and my cooking skills ! 
this watch is cheap enough to just throw them away when it goes bad . they last about 5 to 6 years and you get a new one each 5 years . great for work or play so you do not worry about damage . 
i love this watch . i buy it mainly because of the awesome , easy timers . just one press of the timer button and you have a 1 minute countdown timer . press it twice for 3 minutes , again for 5 , etc . i also love the small size . it ' s not bulky at all , so i can comfortably wear it with any long sleeve shirt without the shirt bunching up . i just wish the band was tougher though . it only lasts about a year before breaking . 
i love the feature for quick timers on the top of this watch and got it because i wanted something cheap , reliable , and easy hour chime . my hearing has got so bad that i couldnt hear the chimes at first , especially the timer ones , when they went off . but i ' ve become more sensitive to it after a little while . if you have high frequencies hearing loss this watch may not be what you are looking for , however for a real wake up alarm you should always use two alarms anyway , and you should pick something louder than this . i believe i did use it years ago for that function though when my hearing was better . i like the stop watch on this better than my sports watch , too so i prefer to use this one for certain functions . 
i purchased this for work , as i needed a second hand . it proves well for durability . price was great also . 
nice inexpensive watch and keeps the time well . perfect watch for a small wrist . very happy with this watch and would recommend . 
gets the job done . the yellow watchface has a nice antiqued look . i wish the actually band was a little bit longer . 
she could not be happier with her watch . she is always looking for small watches but she then complains that the numbers are too tiny . thankfully she has no problem with this one . 
i needed a small watch that was small and big enough to see the numbers , but also that is water resistant . this watch was exactly that i was looking for . the price was a great deal . i love it . 
what i liked about this watch is the fact that i can see the numbers on the dial . what i didn ' t particularly care for was the band . nothing was wrong with it but my wrist got sweaty all the time wearing it . 
this watch is exactly what i was looking for as a regular rugged type watch that i wouldnt worry about losing or getting damaged . it ' s a simple , clean watch with rubberized straps that give the appearance of a lather band because the straps are so thin . my wrists are really small , so this works perfectly for me but may look lost on the wrist of a bigger person . would purchase again . 
the watch dial is the right size for me , but the strap is difficult to work for someone who has arthritis . i would have gotten a little bit longer strap if amazon would indicate the length in their watch info . all in all , it ' s a functional , very pretty watch . 
the watch was small for me . maybe i ' m just used to watches 45mm and up . but the overall buying experience from price to delivery was superb ! 
simple , stylish and light . even better than the f91w . just be mindful if you have large wrists ( the band is relatively short ) . 
my girlfriend just bought me this watch today . i ' m an avid collector of digital retro style watches . pretty easy to use , and feels very comfortable on my wrist . i was surprised that the light wasan actual light and not the blue indiglo / illuminator style but still works well . for the price its a greatwatch . i mostly wear digital dress watches but this will def change up my style and will make a greatwatch for doing any kind of work . 
. buena calidad de los relojes , lo que m & aacute ; s gusta es la calidad , se lo recomend & eacute ; a los amigos 
i remember when i bought my first casio watch back in college which was around 1973 . cost was around $ 50 , no kidding for a plastic watch with a funny digital screen . fast forward 30 years and i am finding myself buying almost an identical watch with some minor mechanical and cosmetic improvements for $ 13 . it just doesn ' t get any better . hope they continue making these watches . they are affordable , keep incredibly accurate time and weight almost nothing . i now find myself returning to a simpler time in my life with this incredible watch . for now , my invicta , timex , g shock and other oversize timpieces can be placed in storage and worn on a special occassions . big is not necessarily beautiful and practical . 
3 and a half stars . first , the amazon partner who is selling this , j & r music & computer world , gets a 5 star rating from me , the watch arrived very fast and in excellent condition . the watch itself gets the 3 and a half because , while the actual purchase price is " $ 9 . 99 " , the crossed - out list price is " $ 24 . 95 " . i expected a little more from a $ 25 . 00 casio . my complaints : the illumination is a small side light , not an entire screen brightness like with other casios or indiglow style . the stop - watch goes only to 59 minutes , 59 seconds . good things : 1 - button press to go from 12 to 24 hour time , alarm function , hourly beep , light weight , slim profile , 50 meter water resistant , 7 - year battery , and easy to use . maybe i ' m overly critical , this is a good $ 10 . 00 watch , but an average $ 25 . 00 watch . [ edit ] : having had this watch for several months now , i find that it keeps better time than a much more expensive digital watch that i had bought at disney world . the disney watch looks great and is all metal , but runs faster than the casio . i compare and set the time of all my watches to my casio atomic / solar mtg920da , which receives a time calibration every day from the atomic clock in fort collins , co . 
great watch for the price could not find any better at any price , i would recommend this watch to anyone 
is the 4 casio watch i bought , is very cheap but great product , my dad love it , his job not let him use a luxury watch cuz can break it or scratch it , so this is perect price for a very good quality watch 
the casio men ' s mq24 = 983 analog watch came on time . the watch has nice light red color in the dial it look so good on my arm . people grabbing my arm to look at the watch , it is a real eye catcher . casio men ' s mq24 - 9b3 analog watch 
i have several versions of this watch . the others are easy to read : black hands on white background ( with numerals or just tick marks ) and gold hands on black background ( elegant look ) . they get 5 stars . this one - - gold hands on a gold background - - is very hard to read . the contrast between hands and face is not as good as shown . by the way , it ' s easy to replace the battery on these watches . the batteries can be had for $ 1 apiece if you look online . 
the watch is basically what i was looking for . a cheap watch with a silicon watch band that i could wear to play golf in and not worry about sweating on it and or loosing it . the problem with this watch is that the hands are gold and so is the watches face , thus making it hard to see what time it is in the sunlight . 
not a mens watch unless you have little girl arms . dial is very hard to see . did not work for me . 
i just received my package in the mail today . i also ordered the mq24 - 7b which really an outstanding product . i had hope that this model mq24 - 9b3 would be the same . fit and finish is almost identical with the exception that it arrived doa . i am going to try to replace the battery and if it works that will be the end of this story . if it doesn ' t , guess i will have to rma back to amazon for a replacement . i guess i really have had some bad luck this year . also sent back a lepai ta2020 amplifier where the left speaker output did not work . also sent back a pyle stereo 75w amplifier which worked for approximately one minute and then died . it is real pain to repackage everything and pursue either a replacement or refund . but with amazon ' s amazing return policy or total satisfaction , it gives me hope and peace of mind . really , nobody does it better . 9 / 24 / 11 : just installed a new battery ( $ 1 . 39 ) and it now works . otherwise , great looking timepiece . however , not truly as good as the mq24 - 7b since you need to angle your watch in order to see the correct time since the minute , hour & second hand are gold colored and almost blend in with the goldtone background . quite nice but not perfect . 
these are so nice and easy to put on , after you put the first one on the rest get even easier . 
i chose these buttons because i trust the carhartt brand . the buttons are sturdy and fairly easy to attach . i use an awl to punch a hole through the fabric first . my right hand has a slight tremor so if i can do it so can most other people . buttons can be used for more than suspenders like replacing buttons or taking an inch off the pants waist by putting a button next to the regular fly button . 
just what i was looking for . needed extra suspender buttons for a different pair of pants . work great . i ' m happy ! i ' d buy from here again . . ' nuff said . yes , i would recommend this to a friend . 
these buttons work perfectly . they are simple to install , and hold on well . i suggest that you pre - hole the jeans material to make it easier . 
these buttons were super easy to apply - i did it . i was afraid my husband might not realize his own strength and might ruin them . it might take a few trys to figure out how hard to pound so the buttons penetrated the denim but didn ' t bend out of shape at any time in the application of the buttons . we hooked my husband ' s suspenders to the buttons and pulled and it feels like they will stay in place during normal outdoor work / activities . these made it so we didn ' t waste the jeans because my husband wears carhartt logger jeans to work in but wouldn ' t wear these until he could use his suspenders with them . very happy so far . if they tend to come loose or issues come up , then i ' ll return and update this review . 
they are hard to get completely in place so that the backs dont get hung up in shirt or underwear . 
i have used these on work pants mainly , they attached & are very strong . i had an idea of trying a set on the inside of the waistband , it bugged me & tended to rub so i cut them off & installed on the outside , no problem & used same holes . they do the job & are worth buying . 
these hardtail " mud " yoga pants are great . they are thick enough to smooth over my lumps and bumps , and the fold over waist keeps the muffin - top at bay . the brown color is a nice warm medium brown . a perfect t3 if you are into dressing your truth . they are long , which is a great feature if you are tall . i am 5 ' 8 . 5 " and i can wear a heel with these . i do wish there was a little less cotton and a little more lycra or added nylon , just so that the cotton percentage was a little less . in my experience , yoga pants and leggings that are a high percentage of cotton , eventually pill and look old faster . so far , that hasn ' t happened . i haven ' t had them long enough to say they last forever . you might be able to size down . i wear a 12 pant normally . i chose the large . i would say that i could probably wear the medium . as they are worn , they stretch to be looser . 
i saw other women around town wearing these , and bought a pair in black for my girlfriend as a gift . o . m . g . do they look good on her ! ! ! comfortable , stylish , versatile , durable and sexy - i ' m not sure what more you could ask from an item of clothing . she loves them because they ' re great at the gym , around the house , and in a pinch , with the right shoes and top , can be dressed up nicely enough to wear out and around without feeling like a slob . very soft , high - quality , nice weight fabric , and very well made . she ' s 5 ' - 4 " and 110lbs , and the size " small " fits her like they were custom made for her , length and everything . we ' ll be getting more in other colors . . . update 3 / 1 / 10 : we ' re up to 3 pairs in 3 different colors , and they ' re all awesome . they look , fit , feel , and perform great . 
my daughter tells me that these run a little big . the mediums were too big for her and she is 5 ' 3 & # 34 ; and about 125 lbs . they do run long . anyway , the small fit perfectly , no bagginess , and not too tight . 
these are adorable , great fit , soft , work well for yoga , roll down waist has nice lycra stretch and holds you in too if you need that . 
i have these in black , so glad to have found these in brown , the seller was a pleasure to deal with ! 
i really like these pants . they do come in long , at least for someone 5 ' 4 " and cuttin the bottom has worked out so far . i would recommend these pants , especially for the money . 
i own three pairs of these magical pants , and it ' s definitely for a good reason . there must be some special cut in the seat of the pants or something , because it flatters just about every booty and perks it right up . . ! ( trust me , you ' ll notice . . and so will other people ! ) i ' m 5 ' 6 " and wear size 2 or 4 pants and i find that a " small " fits awesomely . . it does , however , graze the floor when i wear my sneakers - very fixable though . the colors do fade with time , but i wear these babies to work out at the gym so i ' m not too big of a stickler with that . . ! 
i hate spending a lot of money on shoes , because my son seems to grow out of them every 4 months . so i can ' t really comment on how they wear , because he never has them for long , but these look just as described , are comfortable and he ' s happy with them . they are styllish enough for formal events but he can wear them to the movies as well ( though he considers them too good for school ) and the price was reasonable , so i was happy too . 
very nice shoe ! looks better than the photo . my son loves these . they run big , but we accounted for this based on the brand . 
grandson is 15 months old . daughter was very pleased with the structure and quality of shoe . not wearing much , but he as room for growth . all in all , we are very pleased with the shoe . it ' s hard to fine shoes for little boys , that have great quality , great price and durable , especially for busy little boys . 
this is a pretty good shoe for those special occasions , but proper sizing may take a couple of atttempts . in reading prior reviews , it was hard to say because some said it was too big ; others said it was too small . well , i have to vote for the too big side . if your kid is new to wearing a size 9 , you might want to order an 8 . 5 . if he is nearing the end of his size 9 days , order a size 9 . get it ? shoe has nice rubber soles and is easy to get on with the elastic in the lip . i reordered once . despite the sizing issue , i would order this product again . 
my son is extremely picky about the shoes that are on his feet . ocd is an understatement for his pickiness . he wears a 10 - 10 . 5 size shoe ( depending on shoe ) and i ordered him a 10 and they feet perfectly . not too tight , not to big . they are padded slightly around the back of the ankle and the sides so they don ' t fit like a tight stiff dress shoe fit that is typical of a guy ' s dress shoe ( for this price ) . he was spinning and dancing and jumping and said they were so comfortable ( and no laces mom ! ) . . . mommy approved . 5 year old son approved . i highly recommend this shoe ! 
bought this for my nephew , he isnt to trilled about it but it fits well and looks good . he still struggles a bit to get his feet in because he has wide feet , the elastic at the side could probably be more flexable 
the shoe was the right size and it would have fit on my son but there is no toe room . how are you supposed to fit this on a kid ! i have to admit my boy is built like a linebacker but this shoe has way too small a space from top to sole for anyone to fit there foot in there ! 
bought these to compliment my grandson ' s kindergarten graduation suit . they fit and worked out quite well . in fact he called them his & # 34 ; awesome & # 34 ; shoes ! he wouldn ' t take off his suit or these shoes until bedtime ! the shoes are slip - ons ( easy for him to put on by himself ) and very stylish . that ' s why i got them . i like that he likes them . pricing was right , packaging was secure , and delivery was timely . 
these are a great shoe for kids . fit perfectly and look like a million dollar shoe . highly recommend for your son 
bought these a but big so they would last for our 5 year old . he can slip them on and they stay nicely and look great ! 
i like these shoes , they are easy to get on and look sharp . the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they are a tad bit too shiny . a little overboard on that area , but still nice looking . 
my co - worker purchased this item and she just told me today that the shoes look and fit great . her son loves it . 
i didn ' t like these shoes . my son wears a 6 , i ordered a 6 . 5 , and the shoe opening is so small that i could barely even get the first half of his foot in . i ' m returning these . 
it ' s a little bit big for my son , because i want to make sure it will fit so i ordered 1 / 2 size bigger . but the shoes came in so classy look and very good price , i love it . 
they were just perfect . he did wear them around the house a bit just to ensure they were comfortable and come wedding day he was happy to put them on ! 
gave it a 5 star because i like the shoe and it looked good on my son . the size was perfect - fitted as it should . my son acknowledged it was very comfortable and the shoe sure looks classy . i will not recommend for school - it leaves sole markings 
my 5 year old wore these to my sister ' s wedding . they were perfect for the occasion and didn ' t require any breaking in . 
i give a five star rating because they fit and they are well made . my son looks like a cutie patutie in these with his navy suit and coral bow tie . awesome little man shoes . 
we bought these shoes for our 7 year old son as he needed a new pair of dress shoes to wear with a suit . these deer stags had many favorable reviews on amazon so we gave them a shot . when the shoes came , they looked good , felt well made and my son said they felt comfortable on . they fit true to size as well . another nice thing about these shoes is they are versatile enough to be dressy and appropriate with a suit but not so dressy that they look out of place with more casual clothes . we found these shoes to be a good buy . 
i bought these for my son and they are holding up quite well . well enough to pass down to his younger brothers . 
adorable shoes . they are a big bigger , but i intentionally bought them that way , so he can get some wear out of ' em . happy grandbaby , happy me 
i thought these were the cutest things ever so i got these for my three year old son to go with his little easter outfit . they fit him a little big , but that is fine by me because now he has shoes that will last for a little longer . he thought they were weird when he first put them on because of the heel part . he ' s not used to shoes that have a little heel , but once he got outside and started playing with his family and friends , he forgot all about the heel & # 34 ; problem . & # 34 ; by the way , they still looked new after the first ( adventurous ) wear . i say this because some dress shoes i buy this explorer end up looking terrible by the end of the first wear . 
very nice shoes , great looking , shiny , great quality and durable looking my son wears it for church and weddings , very happy for the purchase . 
these shoes are very good quality and look nice . they seem comfortable , too . they were just a bit big for my preschooler . 
now is this not a strong pair of shoe ? it is . my son absolutely loves it . have to get another pair . 
good deal for dress shoes that won ' t be worn much . they did give my son a little rub mark right at his ankle but only on one foot . so it could have been how he walked . ( 18 months old , size 7 . 5 , huge boy : ) ) 
this shoes has a decent appearance ( a little cheap looking , but it ' s a cheap shoe ) but is so clunky that i felt like i ' d be causing my toddler to trip all day long . he actually started limping when i put them on , despite them fitting . we returned the shoe . 
its getting closer to the brginning of school and my son needed a new pair of shoes . these looked good and deer stag have always worn well . they fit my son ' s feet and he loved them . 
the stitch shoes are the only ones my mom can wear with all her foot problems . she wanted red and the style she has was out of red so i tried these . this style was too tight in the toes . 
this is the second pair of arcopedicos i have bought for my mother - in - law . she loves them . . . . says they feel great on her feet & look nice too 
i ' ve been buying arcopedico for about four years now . i stumbled on this style in a specialty shoe catalog which caters to people with orthopedic problems . i ordered a pair in tan and it was instant love . because they are knit , they provide plenty of ventilation and tons of wiggle room . while they are dandy for home use , they are even better for quick trips out or long vacations . i took a pair of these to williamsburg a couple of weeks ago . lots of walking and standing there so these shoes were heaven sent . i was amazed at how decent my feet felt despite a little swelling after 9 hours of walking . when these get dirty , toss them in the washing machine on a cold cycle and then air dry . after cleaning even multiple times they still look new and have not faded . the rubber soles wear evenly . i wear a womens size 9 and wear these in the european equivalent size 40 . they seem very true to size . i currently own these in beige , black , and navy blue . when i think about foot comfort i know i can ' t put a price on that . 
i gave 2 stars because the shoes are cute and i received them quickly . those are the only positive things i can say about them . i ordered the size that was supposed to fit my feet - the shoes were too short . had i kept them and worn them , my big toe would have poked a hole in the tips of the shoes - probably sooner rather than later . the knit upper is thin giving the shoes a very cheap look - i could see my skin through the weave . there was absolutely no arch support - none . i ' ve had better arch support in a bedroom slipper . to be fair , i have flat feet ; if you have a normal arch - meaning one that does not require orthotics - then this shoe might work for you . i also think that these shoes are overpriced given what appears to be mediocre quality . suffice it to say , i sent them back almost as quickly as i received them . 
i ' ve bought this pair of shoes at the retail store in singapore when i first got pregnant and its the only pair of shoes i will wear up till my son ' s a year old . i would continue wearing them for walks around the neighborhood . its super comfortable ! 
it was time for another pair of the this shoe . my first pair is over five years old and used heavily on a regular basis . it has walked over scotland and paris a number of time . it is my go to shoe for a casual vacation and easy slip on and off at airport . it has been a welcomed shoe for a person with a wide foot who believes in comfort over style . well , this pair is almost the same . the length is a bit shorter even in the same size . the knit seems a bit less dense since at times , in certain lights , i can see my foot even with though i ordered it in black . also the built in support seems to be in a bit of a different place . all in all , i am keeping them , but will be a bit hesitant about ordering again . i am also not throwing away my older pair . 
fits great awesome walking sneaker first time wearing sketchers . would buy again in a heart beat . just awesome thank you 
i bought this to wear at the range , but it is comfortable and looks good so i wear it to and from work and at the range , i am very happy with this purchase 
nice color , very comfortable and practical . can wear with just about anything and not look like you ' re going to play tennis . good stuff . 
i had been buying mostly nike ' s for years with an occasional other brand . i switched to these skechers sport sneakers about 5 - 6 years ago on the advice of my daughter , and i ' m sold on them . the thing i like about them most is that as comfortable and supportive as they are when they are new , the comfort and support seems to continue until the shoe finally wears out or to the point of just looking old and wanting to replace them . i have yet to completely wear out a pair of these , and i ' m tough on sneakers . i just bought my third pair in a row , and as long as they continue making these sports - i ' ll be buying them . 
this is comfortable , has a good foot bed , seems to be good quality , has good traction , flexible and i would buy again 
skechers sport men ' s energy 3 - punisher sneaker are comfortable , stylish , and provide good traction whether hiking or wearing them for casual purposes . i have had mine for about one month and have gone on three 5 mile hikes with a 16 pound backpack . after these hikes my feet felt fine and did not feel fatigued . i did not develop any blisters or hot spots . these sneakers are great for hiking on trails or casual use . i have used these skechers with thick wool socks for hikes and thin cotton socks for general use and the shoe felt great with both types of socks . if you don ' t like untying and tying shoes you can easily slip these on and off with no problem . the tongue stays in place and does not shift to the side requiring constant repositioning to the center . pros : + comfortable ( probably the most important factor ) + good traction on trails + lightweight + stylish + did not need a break - in period before hiking + shoe tongue stays in place + sneakers did not cause blisters , hot spots , or foot fatigue + easy to slip on and off + reasonably priced in a market where you can easily pay double the price for trail shoe by other brandsthis is my second experience with skecher shoes and i expect these sneakers to be a well made , comfortable product that will last a long time . my first pair was a casual work shoe that lasted eight years . i highly recommend these sneakers . they are comfortable with a color and look that i really like in a trail sneaker . 
this is the second of this model watch that i ' ve had . the first was stolen . anyway these are extremely reliable and they look great . the only maintenance you need to worry about is adjusting the date every month . you never need to worry about batteries because any light source powers it . if you are in a heavy duty job ( like construction ) i would recommend stainless steel over titanium . you cannot beat this watch for the money . 
very solid and substial feel . like the fact that i do not have to worry about the battery . i will have to see how the crystal wears over time . it is flush with the case 
i am a watch fan and wanted an everyday good , durable watch . i wanted something that was light weight , self - winding , and had glowing hand and hour markers . i wanted a self - winding watch because i didn ' t want to worry about batteries . well , this watch had it all . granted , it ' s not self - winding ; however , it does have eco - drive technology . eco - drive is powered by solar energy , eliminating the need for batteries . most decent self - winding watches are over $ 500 , so for a watch that doesn ' t need batteries , has titanium , and is just over 200 bucks . . . you can ' t beat it . i love it . 
my husband has been wanting an eco drive watch for some time . so , i decided valetine ' s day was a good time to do that . he has quite a collection of watches already , and we have to spend too much money on batteries for them , so he wanted one that didn ' t require a battery , or movement , to keep it running . this watch is stylish and keeps great time . a little while in the light ( i think it ' s 45 minutes , but don ' t quote me on that ) and it will keep a charge for up to 6 months , which is important for someone who might go that long in between watch wears because they have a few to choose from . although , since it is such a nice watch , he wears it most of the time , now . 
5 plus stars . this watch looks great , keeps accurate time , it is tougher than nails . the case appears to have a bit of a worn appearance to it which is characteristic of titanium jewelry , kind of an older look . i sold one to someone and they did not understand the metal properties of titanium and gave me a bad rating , but make no mistake these watches will look the same ten years from now as they do when purchased brand new . 
i needed a watch for quite a while . it had been many years since i ' d worn one and it was about time that i got back into it . i ' ve seen the commercials during football season and read many reviews before making this purchase . i wanted something durable , flexible for all occasions and attractive . this fits the bill . when the watch arrived , the band was large by 4 links . easy enough to remove them and resize the band , and i had never even done it before . read the instruction to learn how to set the date and time functions . one of the great things about this watch is that it never needs winding or a battery change . the face acts as a solar cell and onced charged fully should last a few months without needing to be replenished with direct lamp or sunlight . if you wear it regularly and it is exposed to light sources during wear , you ' ll never have to concern yourself with needing to intentionally recharge it . amazing . i ' ve gotten a few nice compliments on this watch and it seems to go with just about anything . that makes it very versatile , and along with the low maintenance and great feel on my wrist is why i give it a full 5 stars . 
the watch - - bless titanium ' s little heart . i have several eco - drive watches and they ' re a little on the heavy side in steel . titanium brings them back into the range of lightweight comfort . not in the thin - dress - watch range , but manageable . and the watch is thin enough to allow shirt cuffs to slide over . i rarely nitpick relatively inexpensive watches over this issue , but i ' m delighted that my example has a second hand that hits the seconds dial right on the money . i usually can find something else about which to complain , but this is a pretty slick little unit . it arrived fully charged , displayed the correct date , and was a few seconds ahead of pst . i set it to est and i was in business immediately . the band - - as others have noted , the band is not only light weight but seems inexpensively constructed . after i removed several links the watch fits perfectly and is very comfortable . please keep in mind that this is a " beater " for an office environment and not a " beater " for a construction site . for my purposes it seems quite satisfactory . a perspective - - if i had paid the $ 250 retail for this watch ( and that never would have happened ) , i might have been disappointed with the band and perhaps even with the watch . however , if one will shop this watch he will find a 50 % + discount as i did . with its tasteful , attractive appearance , i believe that this is a wonderful value for the discounted price . i ' m looking forward to many years of service from this watch . good luck with your purchase . - - ronupdate 01 - 22 - 2011 : this is undoubtedly the best combination of comfort to wear and value that i have ever purchased in an everyday - wear timepiece . - - ron 
my wife recently purchased an eco - drive watch . i liked the technology and the price was right so i decided to buy one . i found this one on amazon and also liked the fact that it had a titanium bracelet . it ' s a comfortable size and weight the black dial is easy to read and it ' s suitable for all occasions . and no more batteries to buy ! ! ! 
this is a good - looking , versatile watch . . . it looks great dressed up with a suit or dressed down with khakis . . . took a few links off the band w / a tool kit purchased here at amazon w / o too much trouble . . . the eco - drive technology seems to work great , the watch is keeping accurate time without any problem so far . . . just leaving it on the window sill when the watch is not being worn . . . 
received my eco - drive watch today . shipping took 3 business days from the time the order was placed . watch appears to be well constructed and no issues were apparent upon arrival . the luminescence is outstanding , very bright . the titanium makes the watch very light for its size . i did my research beforehand and the majority of reviews were positive . citizen advertises that the watch has no battery , but research and included information indicates that there is a solar reserve battery . watch does come with a limited 5 year warranty . would recommend to others who are searching for a dependable watch . 
this is a plain but elegant looking watch , and it charges from sun ( or room ) light , keeps time very well and is also pretty visible with large 12 , 6 and 9 numerals that are luminous for easy night use . the crystal is mineral , so no scratches i can see ; the quartz movement is extremely accurate ; the titanium case means it is very light on the wrist ; the 100 m / 330 ft rating means it is truly water resistant . it looks good - i have worn it to formal and business occasions . the price is amazing , and the warranty is five years out of the box . 
lovely and attractive watch . bought it as a birthday gift and my husband has been very happy with its looks and time keeping . 
there is no question that when it has came down to citizen , they have definitely made some excellent watches over the past several years . but there is no question that the eco - drive watches have came in all shapes and sizes that have definitely been worth their money . titanium has also shown it , considering that there have been few lightweight titanium pieces on the market . this classic citizen eco - drive handles well in weight , and comfort . it is very easy and simple to operate in the twist of the crown . i also like it because the hands really illuminate very well in the dark . it definitely is a great piece that is very easy to setup , without much hastle . i like this watch a whole lot , and it is definitely worth the money . price : bsetup & comfort : b + overall : b 1 / 2 + 
the watch looks at least as good as it appears in amazon photos . the band looks great with a blend of brushed and polished metal . it looks and feels pretty heavy and solid , just right on my wrist which is average sized for a man . comfortable to wear . after about a month , it is holding time perfectly . the dial and hands have a high contrast and look very attractive . the hands and markers glow fairly brightly in the dark . the date display is recessed so much that it is hard to read unless lighting is direct and / or you have good vision . amazon price was a lot better than local retailers ' sale prices . i had to remove a few links myself to fit my wrist - using a cheap $ 4 tool also purchased from amazon . 
these do not stretch despite the description . they also look incredibly cheap . not at all impressed . went back as soon as i got them . 
very cheapy looking . one of my worse choices . definitely returning these . the picture did them way more justice then in person . 
my boots just arrived today and i could not wait to try them on . they fit perfectly and felt very good on my feet , i can ' t wait until this fall and winter when i will be able to wear these out they are much to hot to wear now . these boots match my school colors so they will look great when i go to late fall football games and winter basketball games . i have to agree with the other reviewers that these boots do fit tight . i am a very avid cycler and have muscular calves and thighs from many miles on my bike . as i zipped these boots up they were tight but not a problem . when i had them zipped all the way up the were just what i wanted . they fit every curve in my legs snuggly and looked great . i had been looking at these boots for about a year trying to decide if i should buy them affraid that they would not work for me because of my athletic legs . when the price got below $ 40 i had to buy them and find out . i love them and am so glad i bought them , i will be purchasing these in more colors . i am an amazon prime member and got free 2 shipping with this order and they arrived on time in perfect condition . great service , great product ! ! ! 
i read the other comments on this before i bought them . they were right about the leg and thigh portion being narrow , but my wife has very narrow legs to begin with , and she loved them ! they were a little tall for her , but not too tall . she is 5 ' 4 & # 34 ; . 
purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots . thought they would be the thigh highs i was looking for , just for casual wear . they were very large on my leg , and loose from bottom to top . just didn ' t look right . they were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing . i tried them on several times with different looks but couldn ' t find a reason to like them . so , back they went . the shoe part also looked very wide with a pointed toe that was huge . not a good looking boot , and i wouldn ' t even wear them for costume since they just didn ' t look right . glad that others found them acceptable and that ' s all that matters . the silver ones appear to look great , but i now know how they look . too bad . . . . 
these boots are smoking hot , hot , hot ! ! ! my wife looks smashing in them . i took the advise from others and bought a size bigger , turned out to be the right move . 
i ' d give the bra 5 stars except the lace is a bit itchy but other then that the bra is great ! the fit is what i expected and my bf is a huge fan of it as well hahaha proud owner of 34gs that are finally comfortable here 
the bra is scratchy and actually fits a little weird . it doesn ' t fit like the wocoal or natori 32ddd bras i purchased at nordstrom . seems to be inferior quality . 
i decided that from time to time , i needed a bra that was extra pretty . the size i bought are not available at most stores nor are they as pretty . 
this bra feel soooooo good that i bought another one . the second one that arrived was a bit tight but so what . 
this bra fit well at first , but quickly lost support in the cups . now it isn ' t even wearable . very disappointing . 
i think it runs a little big . it was flimsier feeling than i thought it would be . i ended up returning it . 
it fits perfectly . i guess i found my correct size after all . i love it . the material is a bit soft but it works for me . very comfortable . 
this is a beautiful , functional and practically priced bra for the busty woman . it exceeded my expectations by being well - crafted , having the perfect fit and providing ample support for my ample bossom . i will be buying more come pay day ! 
this bra is very pretty but ran small . i ordered a 40c and it didn ' t fit right especially under my armpits causing bulging . recommend it for slimmer women possibly who have less bodyfat under their armpits . 
i wore this bra and then cleaned it per the instructions . the bra warped almost beyond recognition . not worth the money , in my opinion . 
uncomfortable - - band very small . when closed on last hooks metal against skin . jeeze , another 1 / 8 " of fabric too costly ? cup size fine . straps so narrow / skimpy they dug in . that ' s a first . pretty on the outside - - itchy on the inside . must return . 
when i first received my bra it looked a bit small but once - on , it was perfect ! great shape and support . very sexy : ) i ' m extremely happy and plan to order another . . . 
this was a gift for my husband because i recently sneaked off with another of his garment bags . so for the sake of forgiveness , i bought this bag with pockets that is much nicer than the one i took . however , i like this one so much that i am trying to figure out a swap with the original - - lol ! 
excellent garment bag ! i have looked for one locally for my husband and could not find anything that was even close ! my husband loves it and thinks it is made well ! 
i really like this bag . it ' s really durable and surprising the suits stay wrinkle free . plus it has several compartments to put other things . 
this garment bag works well for my needs . i have used it on several trips holding my formal clothes as a carry on . i love the pocket space for extra shoes , wallet , and other loose items . i have carried as many as three dresses and two pairs of slacks at a time with room to spare . my only concern would be that like the others stated it could really use a shoulder strap to carry it with . it does start to get a bit heavy after a while . 
this garment bag held 5 hangers full of clothes . the way it latches at the top makes it a great traveler . hangers stay in place . the pocket is nice for something flat . 
calvin klein microfiber socksthese socks are extremely comfortable to wear , they seem to wick away sweat and feel soft / slippery inside dress shoes . i noticed that in each 3 - pack of socks that the patterns differ . i was hoping they ' d all be the same pattern making life easier when washing and drying the socks , but now i have to carefully sort them to avoid mismatches . the microfiber material is mainly polyester which i have found can last significantly longer than cotton or other natural fibers . after washing them , i noticed that the microfiber picks up on a lot of debris / dirt / lint and that they tend to " fuzz " up very easily . they ' re not as durable as the cheap department store polyester dress socks i ' ve worn for over a year . the calvin klein logo also faded out after 1 wash . overall : 4 / 5 stars , comfortable but tends to attract a lot of lint / fuzz . update : 2013 oct 15after wearing these socks for just over a year , i have to report they are extremely durable . the elastic is strong , and even though the microfiber attracts a lot of lint / dust / fuzz , the material is holding up . most of the logos are gone through washing and wearing , but the socks are hole - free and good to go . i upgraded my original rating of 3 stars to 4 stars . 
these are shorter than i like . i know they aren ' t over - the - calf height , but these are shorter than most crew socks . 
these socks did fit well , but after washing they didn ' t stay smooth and attracted every piece of lint , etc . i expected better for the price ! 
fits great and breathable fabric 
i love the socks because of how super soft they feel . my big complaint is that after a few runs through the dish washer they start to pill . i have not figured out how to prevent this yet . 
during the day , i rarely have problems with leg or foot cramps , but in the middle of the night , i wake up sometimes with horrendous cramps that make me jump straight out of bed in order to stretch my calves and make the pain subside . this , of course is the end of my sleep for this night . i ' ve tried taking every nutrient known to mankind , and nothing helped . so , i decided to try these soft leg warmers . i already knew i would like the fabric because i have socks and scarves made of it . it feels so luxurious . the thing i wasn ' t sure of was whether i could actually sleep in them because my skin is so sensitive , and i thought after a while they might itch , but i ' ve had them for about 3 weeks , and i ' ve slept peacefully throughout ( most ) nights . my sleep has improved about 90 % . they ' re long enough that when nights are cold , i can slip them right down to cover my feet as well , so i ' m warm all the way from my knees to my toes . i think maybe they should come in sizes . i considered getting some for my mom who also deals with night cramps , but i don ' t think they would fit her legs because they ' re quite a bit larger than mine . i ' m 5 ' 2 " and weight 129 lbs , and these fit perfectly . in another review , someone said hers immediately got a hole in them . they come with a tag attached with a plastic strip run through the fabric . clip that strip carefully ; if you jerk it out of the fabric , you ' re almost assured to get a hole in the area where it was pulled through . she may not have done this ; i ' m just sayin ' . anyway , i got a couple of pairs , one to wear and one to wash , and i think this is the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship . 
when my daughter moved north , she was freezing and asked where to get leg warmers . i said the 80s r us ? seriously , no one but amazon seems to carry them so i ordered her 2 pair . 
i love these leg warmers . i wear them all year round . my calfs get cold when sitting at my desk or watch tv so i like to wear these they work well . 
these leg warmers are so soft and cudldy . . . they don ' t fall down even though you hardly notice them . . . they don ' t tighten up as the day goes on and they are easy to put on . . . . 
very warm and very soft a bit too small for my legs so i ' m using them as arm and hand warmers . love them for that . 
i love the soft squishy feel ! ! lots of fun to wear with a variety of shoes . makes my legs look thinner too ! ! ! 
i live in nz and the winters here are pretty cold . it is difficult to find leg warmers here . if i happen to be lucky to find some - it would only come in black and the knit is quite thin . when i asked why there were none , i heard from one new zealander that leg warmers were knitted on demand because they are viewed as a retro type of garment . i said bah ! they were like gloves for legs . . . functionally important in keeping legs warm ! i ordered some from amazon and was quite chuffed at the different colours i could choose from . i can now wear these warmers with short skirts or long skirts or even pants . . . whichever i choose . i now have colours that match . . . and i am bloody warm ! thank you ! 
am very pleased with the quality of these , they ' re soft , warm and fuzzy ! bought for my daughter and granddaughters and they put them on right away . i just ordered 3 more pair for gifts and myself ! 
bought these for a very petite 16 yr old , and they fit great . she loves them , and wears them to football games to keep warm . just right for us . 
i x country ski a lot , and wear leggings and skirts . so the leg warner ' s act as gaiters over my snow boots . 
i wear these all the time they keep me from getting those awful leg cramps . they are soft and fit great . i recommend them . they are a little tight at first but they stretch out some . 
they are like really fuzzy , soft socks for above your feet ! i wear these for cold - weather cycling to keep my shins warm . they seem to do the trick when bundled with thermal pants . 
i had wanted a pair of leg warmers for a while . i searched local stores and did not like what they had due to the colors or the material . i recently got this pair from amazon when i was purchasing something else . have not had a chance to wear them because of the warm weather , but i am sure i will need them when the winter comes . 
i love these legwarmers . they are long enough for legs or arms . they stay up . the assortment of colors is great . i now own 7 pairs . they are the best for the cost by far . 
i wear these during the winter . they keep my legs warm when i need to stand in the cold waiting for a bus . i like them better than wearing a tall boot when there is no snow . i can roll them down when i get to my destination and pull them back up when it ' s time to head out in the cold again . 
delivery was very good , item color was as shown on the internet site , fit from ankle to just below knee . very soft material and they stayed up the whole day . would order again if needed more . 
these leg warmers are nice and thick and warm . they fit snug , not loose . can also wear on the arms as well . 
received these last night and was quite pleased . they are soft and quite warm and they fit my calves very well without sliding down . keep in mind that if your calves are larger they may be too tight . nice value for the money 
these may not be for the fashion set but if you want leg warner ' s that are soft , comfy , won ' t fall down & really keep your calves & ankles warm these are the ticket . they are stretchy enough to wear over jeans , tights , or activewear but also on bare legs . if your heels get cold you can slide them down to cover them or if wearing socks you can pull them higher to cover your knees . these are comfy enough to wear to sleep in . i get " hot flashes " & then get cold afterwards . i can quickly put them on or strip them off ; ) i just ordered several more pair for gifts for my 90 year old mother ( these will be very easy for her arthritic hands to put on ) and my super skinny , always freezing sister . my only complaints are that they will snag , so be careful ! & they are not long enough to pill up above my knees & ankles at the same time ; i ' m 5 ft . 
purchased this in a long length to wear with my long flowy skirts & it is the best undergarment . ordered the xxl instead of my normal xl for an added layer under sheerer skirts . i have found sizing up when in doubt is best with this brand . i ' m a 14 / 16 skirt size . recommend . 
i really like this slip , it works well for my skirts with the slit up the back . i did find the elastic around the waist a little tight even though the slip fit perfect otherwise . however , i am short waisted and i think a medium will fit be better . i will buy this product again and size up . it also washes very well . 
petite half slips , particularly in smaller sizes , are almost impossible to find . in the past , vanity fair has always been my brand of choice . the " vanity fair women ' s half slip with slip , damask neutral " lives up to my expectations . the fabric is soft and fluid ; it is well suited to wearing under knit or jersey dresses . the 16 " length is perfect for more petite women or those who like to wear very short skirts or dresses . construction of the " vanity fair women ' s half slip with slip , damask neutral " is excellent . the elastic is encased in the tricot fabric and two rows of stitching secure in within the casing . this type construction insures that the slip will not become useless if a stitch breaks as there is another row of stitching securing the elastic . if you are in need of a half slip , you may want to consider the " vanity fair women ' s half slip with slip , damask neutral " . update , july 15 , 2013 : i liked the " vanity fair women ' s half slip with slit , damask neutral " so well , that i returned the " vanity fair women ' s tricot double slit half slip " and replaced it with an 18 " " damask neutral " . amazon ' s policy on returns and their customer service rate 5 - stars ! 
i looked at all the local stores for replacement half slips and found that the fabric was either too heavy or light . this vanithy fair is just right . it ' s a good length for just below the knee skirts for me , washes well , and does exactly what it should . 
this is a good quality slip and nicely fits . works as stated . i would recommend this product . though it seems to run on the larger end . 
this neutral half slip is 18 inches long and had a slit that can be moved to the front , back or side to accomodate a dress or skirt with a slit . it does not stick and it is long enough to cover the wearer ' s private parts and block any & # 34 ; see through & # 34 ; 
im buying another pair of these shoes i only had them two days when i got compliments on them im an 8 to an 8 in a half and i ordered the 8 perfect fit not big or small great shoes if you have wider feet they are perfect 
these flip flops filled the bill as far as comfort , traction and even a bit of support . i loved them dearly and wore them often & # 8230 ; for 6 months . now , the toe of one has pulled out of the sole . the way these shoes are made makes it difficult to fix , so sadly , i have to throw them away . it ' s too bad that one can ' t expect more wear out of a well made flip flop . 
love love love these . this is my second pair - watch out for puppies - they love to chew on these ! so cushy and comfortable . best price i ' ve seen for montrails . 
i sized up being a half size . there was too much slippage . i don ' t think sizing down would have helped with comfort . i have a very bad pronation on one leg , my heel was hanging over the wide foot bed . too much room for my foot to move around . i need something with cushioning also . great quality in this shoe however , just not for me . 
bought these for " house shoes " as an alternative to the hot , overpriced and uncomfortable products a local specialty store was pushing . other reviews didn ' t make it clear - you heat these in the oven for 3 minutes and mold them to your footbed . the arch support is fantastic and i ' m having no plantar fasciitis pain . truly wonderful . there is no way these are just staying in the house . i can envision needing several pairs of these shoes . plus the amazon price was much lower than other internet options . i bought a size 9 - i normally wear a 9 . 5 - 10 but these accommodate my wide foot so well they fit like a glove . 
things period . they fit well , they support , they are comfortable - after 1 year there was a bit of dehiscence on the sole which was easily affixed with shoe goo . love these . 
i had a pair of these a few years ago and lost them , so came back to purchase another pair . they are bulky in appearance compared to a lot of flip flops , but man are they cushioned and comfortable ( especially after molding them in the oven ) . they could use a bit more arch support , in my opinion - but i need a lot of arch . i most often wear a 9 . 5 and these were way too big in a 10 . my mom ( who wear a 10 . 5 - 11 ) kept them for herself . size down if you are a half size . 
love them ; love them ; love them ! ! ! ! this my second pair . the first pair i used last year to wear in the evening ( after taking off my hiking boots ) whilst walking the 800km of the camino trail in spain . it was wonderful to have my toes free at the end of the day . until that time i had never worn & # 34 ; flip - flops & # 34 ; and had always thought that i didn ' t want to have rubbing between my toes . this never happened ! there is wonderful arch support and they look really smart . also so light in my pack . i have recommended these sandals to many people . . . . . . even bought a pair for my husband ! jenn 
needed a pair of super comfy , supportive flip flops for a trip to arizona and hawaii . never been able to wear flip flops all day due to the discomfort . . . well no more ! these are fantastic . very supportive arch , pillowy / cloud footbed . you heat them up in oven for a few mins prior to first wear and then stand in them to mold them to your own foot . just wore them for our week long trip to arizona resort / spa and had comfy feet all week ! 
i read a review and decided to go with the recommendation of going with a size larger . . . . . . i should not have . i should have ordered my usual size of an 8 . i didn ' t want to return them cause i didn ' t want to deal with exchange policy . i figured i would just give them to my friend . and then i remembered that on one of the reviews i read , it had said that u put them in the oven to mold them to your feet . so i thought i would give it a try , and i did . i placed my feet to the center of the sandals and molded them where they should of fit if they had been the right size . . . . and it worked . they are really soft on my feet ( little big ) , glad i didn ' t give then away . i would order them again , but i would order my size next time . i get them wet all the time and they dry really fast . they seem to be good qualify . . . . . so far . i do like the color , just not the size . 
i pondered ordering these sandals since february of this year and am glad i finally did . i have to be honest - i haven ' t yet dared to put them in the oven for the heat molding - but these are very comfy and supportive as they are . so far i ' m loving these . 
very cushiony and comfortable but with support for your arch . my foot fits in 9 1 / 2 - 10 b width . i ordered the size 9 and there is plenty room - i would order a size down from what you normally wear . love them and i love this light blue color combo ! 
i didn ' t realize when i made this purchase that you could bake these sandals in the oven and let them mold to your feet , so that was a nice surprise to read about when i opened the package . the sandals look very nice and i ' ve gotten compliments on them already ! they are definitely comfortable . 
love the sandal . very comfortable and i wear them as much as possible . i bought these in other colors as well . 
after reading all the great reviews on amazon i was so excited to get these shoes . i have amazon prime and paid the extra $ 3 . 99 to have these shoes shipped quickly . i received the shoes and found them very painful . they look like men ' s flip flops , very clunky looking . i decided to work through the pain and ugliness and give the shoes at least a two day trial . i failed . when i woke up the next morning i put these shoes on and they were even more painful than the day before . i have a daughter that wears the same shoe size as i do , so i decided that i ' d give the shoes to her . she tried the shoes on and couldn ' t stand wearing them for even a minute . she said the shoes were trying to roll her feet out which is exactly how the sandals made my feet feel x10 . my daughter and i both wear oasics running shoes everyday , and we both have fairly flat feet . i had high hopes for montrail women ' s molokini sandals , but these shoes are too painful to wear . i live in a very rural area and have purchased from amazon bi - weekly for over 10 years . i ' ve only returned one item to amazon in that time span , but i will be returning these shoes . 
let me preface my review with my story . i ' ve had plantar fascititis for several months now . . . it ' s getting better , but my feet still hurt from time to time . i ' ve spent a fortune trying to find a comfortable shoe i can wear for hours . i ' ve bought two pairs of chaco ' s , two pairs of tevas , a pair of jambu , merrills , clarks . . . you get the picture . nothing really worked for me . after reading the reviews for the montrail molokini , i decided to take the plung and order a pair . i am so glad i did ! these are the most comfortable shoes i ' ve found in a long time . i haven ' t baked and shaped them , but plan to do that soon . even without the custom fit , they are awesome . i highly recommend these to anyone in need of comfy summer sandals . i did have to order up a size ( thanks to the reviews i knew i needed to ) . . . i usually wear an 8 or 8 1 / 2 and purchased the 9 . they fit great ! 
i purchased these twice , because they are so comfortable and supportive . the problem is , neither held up for a year . in fact the tread began peeling after just a few months of walking on normal surfaces . compare that to the less comfortable but inexpensive reefs and tevas that will last 5 + years without falling apart . 
i purchased my own montrail sandals last year in preparation of walking " the camino " in spain . the owner of the small sport shop in bc canada suggested them to wear at the end of the day . . . . . they were very light and didn ' t rub between my toes ! after walking 20 - 25km it was wonderful to spread my toes in the sandals ! thus i bought a pair for my husband for his birthday . . . . . . he is so happy with his pair also . i plan to purchase another pair for myself in a different colour next year . i have already recommended these sandals to others . 
hello , i must have worn millions of sandals over my lifetime , but these montrail molokai sandals are the most comfortable , ever ! i have wide feet , but this sandal fits like a glove with no restrictions or bindings . the strap that goes over your arch is so soft and comfortable that it doesn ' t feel like anything is on your feet . the sole of the sandal gives good grip , but on a waxed floor , it squeeks a lot . walking around outside , it does not squeek . the sandal is very soft and comfortable . it feels like it is molding to my feet as i walk on it . i know it is supposed to be heated to mold to your feet , but so far , it doesn ' t seem necessary . my feet feel like they are surrounded by soft pillows and it makes walking that much more comfortable . the arch is great . the sandals seem like it is just soft rubber , which is basically correct , but the design that went into making these puts it on the top of my list of comfortable sandals . i have owned reef sandals , ( fanning and leather fanning ) several sperry santa cruz , etc , all kinds of rainbows , several cheepies and all of the other ones are either break easily , are too narrow , or bind somewhere . these montrail ' s are the best so far . you can ' t go wrong . . . the delivery was great , but the packaging was a little overkill . update : they are still the most comfortable sandals ever . but , after wearing them for a long period of time during the day , they have developed an interesting squeek from the soles . the soles are super grippy and on polished tiles , mall marble floors and smooth wooden floors creates an unusual squeek . on carpeting , no noise is prevalent . 
if you have a high arch don ' t think about any other sandal , this is my 2nd pair and i have told others about my experience and they purchased some also , maybe i should be a factory rep in hawaii . . . . 
my husband and i love these sandals . i only wish they continued the pana line for women . my husband won ' t wear anything but these , they are wide enough for his wide feet and comfortable enough to go for our evening 2 - mile walks . 
great sneakers . . . really comfortable . . . light on my feet and i love the color . i recommend these sneakers to anyone . cant ever go wrong with saucony . 
love how the shoe fits as well as the fun color scheme . a good value for the price too ! 
these shoes were not that comfortable . they have no arch support . i did not think they were made very well . i returned them . don ' think i will buy shoes online again 
hands down , the best sneaker out there for low - impact activity . super - lightweight , durable and comfortable . i have them in nearly every color and wear them every day to the gym for circuit training and spin class and also post - gym to run my errands and whatnot . highly recommend . 
i ' ve been wanting these forever but they are so expensive in certain colors . i finally found the pink on sale ! i absolutely love them ! i usually wear an 8 . 5 in most athletic shoes but i ordered these in an 8 and the fit is great . i also have a slightly wide foot and i was worried about the width but fear not , they are fine . i recommend these for anyone looking for a comfy casual shoe . i am a happy camper ! 
i have a few pairs of saucony jazz sneakers . these are the low pro model . they are well made and comfortable , just not as comfortable as their original model . . . . the heel being thicker on those . if you are looking for a very cushy shoe go with the originals . these look great with jeans and are quite uncommon . the colors are bright and the shoe light weight . i got a great price so if your not in a hurry keep checking amazon to see if the price lowers ! 
i have a pair of these in red and i love them so much i ordered another pair . they are the most comfortable sneaker i ' ve ever owned , very pleased ! 
roomy shoe , well made , nice colors ; may have to return , slightly big on foot 
i love these saucony shoes ! they fit great . i ' m usually an 8 . 5 or 9 in most shoes and ordered the 8 . 5 in this model . comfortable , stylish , and true to size ! 
love saucony shoes but the jazz are my go to ' s ! no breaking in with these , put them on and wear them in comfort . i own 5 pair ( some are the retro with the thicker heel ) but all are great in cute colors . safest shoe to buy online , due to easy fit . 
my " tween " daughter loves these saucony jazz shoes . they are comfortable and stylish . this is her 3rd pair . i ' m glad that i found them online . they are both old - school and stylish / 
my son wanted a blue camo backpack and this is perfect . typical backpack size and will hold lots of folders , spirals , etc . . . durable . good backpack and i am just as pleased and excited about it as my son is . recommend this to anyone . : ) 
this is wearing very well , especially compared to some of the more heavily decorated backpacks my child has used over the last couple of years . 
still going strong into school year number two ! we originally purchased this to replace a school bag that had really bad zippers . my boy picked this out on amazon because of the camouflage color pattern . i arrived as expected and the quality looked great out of the box . i was surprised today to find out that i never wrote a review on it . well , its still going strong and the boy still loves it . what else can one say . 
bought for a 6 yr old based on the reviews on how small this bag is . it is not very small and too large ( wide and long ) for a large 6 yr old . the bag does seem a bit flimsy ( esp . the organizer pocket material ) and does not hold its shape that well . good straps , vibrant colors , zippers zip all the way down so you can access the bottom of the bag easily and the reflective tape is a nice safety feature . many pockets and pockets in pockets , which my child loves . . . i personally don ' t care for that many pockets . overall : a good bag for the price , but you could probably get something similar at a discount box store at the same price point or less . 
i bought this pack for my high - school - age son to use for school . after a month of regular use carrying his textbooks and supplies , fabric of the pack ripped along the zipper for the largest compartment , not mendable because the fabric was raveling . i noticed that other parts of the fabric were showing similar signs of failing . the great price was too good to be true . 
i needed a bag to use when riding my motorcycle . this bag was just what i was looking for . the refelcetive strip and the orange color add to the safety so motorist can see me . also i am in the army and on my post it is required for motorcyle riders to have a refelctive belt on the bag when riding . this in turn removed the need for me to have to use the belt with the reflective strip on it . not to mention this bag is the perfect size and has many pockets . great bag ! ! ! ! ! ! 
ok , i bought this bag to use as a bug out bag for one of my cars . i wanted a sturdy bag that can hold extra cloths , medical supplies , some food and water , etc . . . it will work for its intended purpose . i would not use this bag for every day use , however because it seems that it would wear out fairly quickly . for sitting in the car 99 . 9 % of the time , however , it fits the bill , especially for the price . the zippers could be stronger i guess , but overall it would be a fine bag for edc for a child , but i would get something better for heavy packing or hiking . 
purchased this for my 15 year old son . the bag was in the garbage . it ripped in the bottom corner , and the hole proceeded to get bigger and bigger rather quickly . it was used to transport school books . disappointed . my son pulled out a jansport he has had for several years . i should ' ve stuck with that brand . 
i bought this for my 10 year old son as a backpack for school . the only thing he keeps in his backpack is a small 3 ring binder and occasionally he ' ll shove his sweatshirt in it . there are 2 zippers on the big main pocket and within the first 3 weeks of school the zipper broke . i don ' t have much use for a backpack that won ' t close . won ' t be buying another k - cliffs backpack . 
i like the features because it has everything kidsneed for school . yet , not too heavy or big , but wellmade and functional . my grandson loves the & # 34 ; camo & # 34 ; 
the backpack are good in texture . my children use them for school . bright in color . they are durable . i would recommend to a friend . they arrived in good timing . 
i used this backpack maybe a dozen times this past season during triathlon training . it holds my wet suit and goggles and a towel on the bike ride to the pond ( about 20 miles ) . it works fine for this purpose and when used occasionally , but if this saw daily use as a school bag , it would not have lasted more than a couple of months . the material is thin and the seams are not very well made . 
you get what you pay for for when it comes to backpacks . this one is cheap in every way . get a more expensive one if you want your pack to last a long time . this one will not suffice . 
i bought these for my husband and they look and fit great . nice quality , sleek , simple look . i would recommend to others . 
this is my second pair of " whiskers " sunglasses from oakley . my first pair gave me 4 years of year round , hard usage , had been sent back for a bent frame ( my fault ) once and several pairs of new lenses . finally lost the original pair in the atlantic ocean . . . . . . i ordered these from amazon after calling and consulting with oakley directly . i was advised by the salesperson @ oakley that as long as the whiskers were " fulfilled by amazon " ( and " not some mom & pop store " ) that they should be legit . so , i went ahead and ordered them . upon arrival , i too found that the inside temple was marked " china " . so , again i called oakley . i was advised by the salesperson @ oakley that they do indeed have some of their products made outside of the usa , and whiskers are made in china . he stated that it was a misconception that all oakley products are usa made . i was able to register my whiskers on oakley . com , and now the warranty is extended to 2 years . going back to the sunglasses themselves , these are a low profile pair of sunglasses . they sit close to the face with a slight " wrap " design to the lenses , allowing for a close fit , decreasing sun " leaking " in around the edges . i purchased the black frames with the black " iridium " lenses . i personally do not like polarized lenses because of the effect polarization has on the true color of things ( especially the blue / green spectrum - seems to make things appear unnaturally bright to me , and definitely changes the color saturation ) . so , since i prefer a very dark lens which does not alter the reality of the colors in nature , these are perfect for me . these lenses are great for anywhere where light reflection / glare is an issue ( water , snow , etc . ) . i get headaches from too much glare , and these glasses with the iridium lenses never let me down . i find them very comfortable , allowing me to wear them for many hours at a time . the only " negative " might be , that i personally would not wear these for any kind of sport ; while they have high quality , impact resistant lenses , the frames are not designed to take a beating . as a parting comment , i am a woman , and i prefer the style of these glasses over the huge , " jackie o " , rhinestone encrusted style sunglasses that are so common for women . these fit my angular face very well , and they fit like a glove , never slipping off of my nose . 
i love oakley sunglasses , i ' ve been wearing tightrope , but this one are very good sunglasses , not too heavy , so comfortable and even they ' re not polarized , it protect pretty good on the sunshine . 
this past summer was a horrible summer for any sunglasses i touched . i went through about a dozen cheap pairs that i picked up from local brick and mortar stores . sitting here i realize that , if i were to add up the cost of all these cheap sunglasses , i could of bought a couple of very nice pairs . i have only owned cheap sunglasses and i wondered if paying a premium on sunglasses is worth it . enter the oakley mens whisker sunglasses . i picked these up because they came to my attention being apart of a sale . i was hesitant due to even the sale price but , as i mentioned beforehand , just a few cheap pairs would cover the cost of these glasses . they arrived in the mail and come pre - packaged in a simple cardboard box . within the cardboard box the glasses are protected in a soft cloth bag and also contain a cleaning rag and small info brochure . i immediately pulled out the glasses and spent the next few hours walking around trying them on and , have to say , i am pretty impressed . many of my cheap glasses broke due to poor construction of the frames . these frames feel durable and like they will last . i have a large head that does put tension on glasses . these glasses were able to take the tension yet retain their original shape . the glasses are not polarized but do a good job on their own protecting my vision from the suns glare . the lenses are the perfect tint and did not block out my vision of the outside world . i received compliments from my wife and neighbors about how stylish the glasses look . it reminds me of the hoopla during the 80 ' s when tom cruise sported " aviator " glasses from the movie top gun and the craze he created . pro : + + durable construction + + compliments on how stylish they lookcon : + + for price , only receiving a cloth bag for protection is cheapconclusion : these glasses are well worth the premium paid over regular sunglasses you find sitting on a carousel rack at the local brick and mortar stores . just watch for the sales when they go on to pick up then . 
no question oakley has an excellent product . they price on brand and they are not the best for the price . i ' m not being critical ( well , yes i guess i am ) , i have 3 pair , but i have others as superior for far less price . my single most irritating issues is that they don ' t offer dod civilians working in war zones any significant discounted prices . many fine companies do and many ( including starbucks ) offer free product . yes , oakley offers a military line at a discount , but they are far inferior to the consumer brands , so they aren ' t offering the military and their support any value . save money , get another pair of fine polarized sunglasses . oakley is a name only . look at their kitchen sink back pack for $ 200 . are you kidding me ? twice the price at half the value . the next thing they will sell is high end women shoes ! 
i recently received this watch as a replacement to one i had about ten years ago . i love it . it isn ' t the strongest watch . the plastic scratches and the band breaks fairly easy but for the price and the elegant look i like how it feels and the watch keeps perfect time . it is also light as a feather . csl 
bought to replace similiar watch that lasted quite awhile . this one broke in less than a month ; stem / winder broke off , could not make stay re - attached . would most def not recommend . . . . 
i ' ve had my victorinox swiss army renegade watch since 1999 or 2000 . mine originally had a nylon strap , but it is essentially the same watch . it ' s been great over the years and i still include it in my watch rotation . other than a single band replacement , and some new batteries , it has been a flawless , trusty companion . the design is timeless , and it ' s not a hefty as some newer watches , but that ' s part of its charm . the case is a tough back plastic ; mine has developed some " personality " over the years , yet still looks great . this is a great choice if you ' re looking for an affordable swiss - made timepiece . 
after returning the watch that i bought i confirmed with victorinox by email that this watch has been discontinued . i may know the reason . there are two manufacturing contact points at the base of the buckle . they cause irritation on the wrist with the slightest pressure such as placing the hand on a table . this used to be a wonderful watch . i owned one for many years and gave it to a friend who was in need . now , a few years later , i bought another one and promptly returned it when i saw that it was turning my wrist red from irritation . the one i bought online from a major retailer arrived running with the time and date set . i presume it was a return . this is sad . 
i have had this watch for about 10 years now and was just checking around to see if it is still made , and to my surprise it still is , which is good . i have worn this watch to work almost everyday on from when i got to about 2006 . i stopped wearing it because my cell phone has a clock and was using that . my wife took over the watch and started wearing it to work . her job involved putting her hands in water and chicken fat daily throughout the day . i thought well that ' s it for my swiss army watch . needless to say about 6 months ago i took on a job where i needed a wrist watch . i found my old watch , the leather band i had put on it was destroyed and the watch was not working . i brought to my local watch guy and told him to replace the battery . at first with the new battery nothing happened , watch didn ' t work . i told him , the contacts are probably dirty , the watch has been through hell . he took the battery out cleaned the contacts and put the battery back in . voila , the watch is keeping perfect time ! while i was there i purchased a new band and he cleaned the watch up for me with whatever they use . with the new band and the cleanup , the watch looks brand new again . he only charged for the battery , $ 5 , and a new black leather band , $ 18 . you cannot kill this watch . if this one every really broke , i would not hesitate to buy another in a heartbeat . 
this is by far the best watch i ' ve ever owned . it was a bit expensive compared to the others i have used in the past but it was so worth the $ . 
i read online that these boots run big so instead of ordering the next size up , i ordered a 1 / 2 size larger and they are perfect . my granddaughter is 7 and loved them as much as i did . only wish they came in adults sizes . 
purchased these for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she loves them ! ! they are a bit stiff so her feet hurt the first couple times she wore them but now they ' re comfortable . i have a similar adult pair from the same mfgr and i love mine as well ! ! 
great boots . bought them for my niece and she absolutely loves them . very well made and fit the online description perfectly . 
bought for birthday . she looks so cute . very girly . a good price and are wearing well . chain is removable . very chic ! 
got these for my 3 year old ! she loves them , and they are absolutely adorable ! they fit great , and they are fairly soft unlike some boots for kids ! very happy with them ! ! ! 
these boots look better than the picture , my 5yr old loves them , i also got a pair for my grand daughter she put them on right away the boots look so cute with dresses . i am so happy for this purchase , highly recommend . 
gift for a granddaughter ! she loves them and they were true to size and fit . she loves boots and these are her sunday best ! ! 
i bought these to wear to a rodeo event at my son ' s school . i am a woman , not a kid . i usually wear a size 6 1 / 2 in womens dress shoes and a 7 in womens boots ( i go a little larger with boots to allow for wearing socks ) . i bought these pink durango boots in a a youth size 6 and they fit just a tad large on me . the measurement of the boot from the tip of the toe to the end of the heel is 10 inches if that helps you with sizing at all . . . . . . i would imagine for a young girl the they would fit exponentially larger . the boot itself is very cute . it is made well and looks nice even though it is faux leather . mine had a few black rubs on them , but nothing that would make me want to give them up or return them . i love the color . . . it is just hte perfect shade of cotton candy pink . the rhinesone strap is also cute . i thought it might look a little gaudy in person but i actually like it . however , it is removable as well so if you did not like the look of the strap or just felt like not wearing it for whatever reason you can take it off . . . . . pretty neat ! ! the heel is low and comfortable ( i measured it and it is a 1 1 / 2 inches ) . there is enough room in the shaft to fit my " not quite youth sized " calves . overall these are a great pair of boots that any little cowpoke ( or cowpokes mama ) would be thrilled to have . 
these are really nice shoes . i was a bit skeptical at first because of the low price and the fact that the shoes are waterproof . my concern was that they would not shine well . i spit shine my shoes and as a result , need top quality leather that shines well . to my surprise , these shoes shined up brighter and nicer than any of the military shoes i have ever owned . the comfort is spectacular . the shoes look dressy , but don ' t have that uncomfortable dress shoe feel . the support is great ! these aren ' t casual tennis shoe feeling shoes . the support is solid and strong , but very comfortable . there is no need for much break in . i have found myself a new number one shoe choice here , as long as rockport makes them . 
rockport ellingwood has proven to be the ideal replacement for a prior rockport shoe that had all of the same details but a slightly more rounded toe . the ellingwood ' s squarer toe is an attractive update . the size runs true , the leather is smooth , and the comfort continues to make rockport first choice . this shoe looks good with suits and feels great . 
for the first i wear this shoes , after walking no more than 1000m , the heel port srubbed my heel , and get my heel peeling . 
i wear these regularly to work as they are comfortable and look nice . they are easy to keep clean and to shoe . 
often a good product goes without a review , so here is mine in the rockport ellingwood . rockport men ' s ellingwood cap toe oxford is an overall outstanding value in a men ' s dress shoe . you can dress it up or down , an it isn ' t overly shiny such that it could not be world with khakis . the shoe has excellent support , especially at the ball of the foot and at the heel . i wore this to a trade show with several days of walking a show floor - - 9 , 000 steps on a pedometer each day , and the shoe was exceptionally comfortable on the entire 4 - day trip . the sole is polyurethane , so it did require a couple of hours to break it in . once broken in , the shoe flexed well with my feet . the heel counter is padded so it collars nicely behind my achilles tendon . as this is somewhat of a boxed toe design , there is less room at the big toe ; however , if you are confident of your foot size ( and width ) then rockports tend to fit true to their size . the style is nice , not too bulky , and they could pass for more expensive dress shoes absent the tap as you walk with traditional leather - soled dress shoes . the shoe is well proportioned , conservative but not boring . i use these shoes with suits and even dress up my khakis . in walking these shoes are very stable side - to - side , so the construction of the shoe is very consistent . running through one airport segment , the ellingwoods complied nicely . these are nice walking shoes and okay for running ( they are nikes nor should they be ) . the ellingwood model uses rockport ' s last generation kinetic air circulator insole which actually seems to pump air around the inside of the shoe . i wear foxriver socks so my feet did feel drier . note : while this is an older model the insole is plenty contemporary and comfortable . grip of the polyurethane sole exuded confidence when walking wet , smooth concrete ; very slip resistant . a complaint i have is about the laces on the ellingwood not being sufficiently " waxed . " waxed laces can last all day without retying . i would spend an extra dollar to rockport for waxed laces . this isn ' t enough to take away from the overall shoe experience . the true litmus test is whether i would buy these shoes again ? all things considered i ' d answer that question with a resounding , " yes ! " highly recommended ! one afterthought has to do with polyurethane soles . i ' ve owned brands such as ecco , bostonian and sebago and clarks . when letting the ecco sit idle ( less than one wearing a month ) , the soles of both pair of shoes eventually cracked under load . apparently this is a shortcoming of polyurethane soles and not brand - specific . but having said that , my other pair of rockports has a polyurethane sole yet they did not crack after sitting idle for a year . that said , i trust rockports . second afterthought : i have worn rockports for over 20 years , and i keep reupping , using the world tour classic as a daily casual shoe . i found ecco to be comfortable ; however , with the shoes cracking i have some consternation about the brand . and googling " ecco cracked sole " yielded an eruption of complaints . that said , i remain loyal to the rockport brand . third afterthought : the newest rockport models employ the adiprene insole by adidas , some sort of neoprene blended insole , and they are comfortable . i could not say they were noticeably more comfortable than the kinetic air circulator insole in the ellingwood ; however , you should be aware of this . 
here ' s how they get you : the appearance , the look , the color and the price are great , right ? but the actual shoes suck . not leather , cheap chinese crap for amateur shoe - wearing men . if this is going to be your first pair of dress shoes , i feel sorry for you . these are what some high school math teacher pedophile would wear , seriously . very dated style . like a nightmare out of the ' 90 ' s . boring as hell . terrible . i totally regret buying dress shoes online . what the hell was i thinking . 
finally , found a shoe that comes in the m width needed by my husband . hopefully the rockport shoes will last awhile . my husband is a teacher and he wears this type of shoe almost everyday ( except days he wear jeans and tennis shoes ) . great shoe for the price . 
when i first got them i thought i got a great deal because they looked so great . the first time i wore them for two hours i recieved blisters , but i thought that was just because i had to break them in . no luck still 
received these shoes , and wore them to work immediately . these rockport are truly comfortable . in spite of walking and being on my feet all of my working days , i feel only a little tired . waterproof leather protect from rain just fine . the only problem i see is a cap toes make the best socks go real quick . so with these you have to get plenty of cheap socks . otherwise i really like the shoes . 
these are attractive shoes . it took a while for the shoes to break in and fit properly , but now they are comfortable and fit well . 
rockport is my go to shoes so i went with these for a special occasion ( wedding ) in june . . i ' ve tried them on and they should be ok as this is my normal rockport size . . . so you won ' t read anymore from me on these unless there ' s a problem . i will , however , try them on again and use them around the house just to make sure as i exist in sneakers and docksiders since my retirement . 
it is a good fit and comfortable . especially when you are on your feet all day . i tend to replace this shoe with the same shoe every few years and am very happy with them . 
i ' ve bought and worn multiple pairs of these shoes over several years . they aren ' t going to be the dressiest you own , but they look nice and wear really well . they ' re comfortable ( they are rockport , after all ) , and impervious to the weather . for the price , a really nice shoe . 
quality shoes need to say , is a big brand factory good product . just in time to do activities , cheap , very satisfied with this shopping 
i bought these for casual / dress wear . the style is excellent . that said , the shoes are a bit stiff , but other reviewers said that they break in easily . as i wore them over a day , that is true . size is a bit of a problem . i recently purchased other rockport shoes and found them a half size small , as others have commented . for that reason , i bought a size 11 . what a surprise - the shoes were true to size and i needed to get my normal 10 . 5m . my recommendation is to buy shoes in 2 sizes and return the ones that don ' t fi . 4 month follow up : after wearing these shoes for a while , i have to drop a star . they are tapered more toward the toes than ican handle . i feel pressure and pain after wearing them for several hours . they do not seem the quality of previous rocport shoes . 
ok i have used these for two weeks , quality seems to be great , but nothing stands out . . . shoes are more shiny than they are in picture . . . . plus they still did not break in and feel very hard on the ankles as you walk . . . . i really want to like those . . . i don ' t hate them but i still do not feel tempted to wear them in the morning . 
took me about 3 - 5 days to break in good because show was tight , but after that heaven ! ( 12m ) very comfortable , with all day wear - ability . nice insole cushion and good sole . can feel some rocks or gravel through soft sole but insole makes up for this and it ' s not a problem . great looks too for professional or casual environment . looks better than pictured . when i wear these out i will order another pair ! used as office she where 80 % in office and 20 % in field where different pavement surfaces are encountered from paved to dirt , to rocks . " my name is eric and i endorse this product ! " lol 
the style is very large and pointy - - my poor husband was tripping on them ! 
i am one of those unfortunate souls with narrow feet . so , being able to find a b width is a godsend . i am also somewhat new to needing to meet a dress code . so , i am really outside my comfort zone here . but these are a nice looking shoe . and i dare say , very comfortable , even though i have only had two days in them . nice cushy foot bed and seem to be breaking in quickly . my first pair of rockports but not my last , i am sure . 
i was stunned by how beautiful these shoes looked when they arrived , the photos do not do them justice . the shoes fit well , but the top of the tongue has a sharp leather edge that dug into the front of my ankle which made it uncomfortable for me . i was sad to have to ship it back . 
i work in an office , have to wear a suit a couple days a week , and the rest of the time i am business casual . these shoes , which i have in black and brown , work perfectly in this environment . these are not $ 500 italian leather shoes , but i don ' t need shoes like that . these are leather shoes , extremely comfortable , with rubber soles for grip . they look fine with a suit , wool dress pants , or pressed khakis . ( i myself do not wear them with jeans . ) they have the added benefit of being waterproof . in particular , every morning i walk across my front lawn to my car . the grass is always wet from dew and my shoes normally get wet . after wearing these shoes , i quickly noticed that my shoes and socks weren ' t wet when i got in my car to drive to work . 
this shoe is great looking ! i bought these thinking that i would use them for work , but after wearing them a couple of times , i decided that i can actually also use them with khaki ' s for casual wear . the shine is great and as expected from a pair of rockport ' s - they are very comfortable . i highly recommend this pair . just take note that they were just slightly longer than my other pairs of rockport ' s with the same shoe and width size . also the brown color is closer to cordovan or burgundy but they still fit the bill . 
this shoe uses a very firm leather which is thicker than other rockports i have owned . they are substantial shoes that feel very durable . i took me a couple of days of wearing to break them in . the soles are thick and supportive , yet still have a good amount of " spring " in them . the leather has a fairly high gloss . 
i ordered the 9medium in black . they are beautifully made , very classy looking without seeming overly pointy or so shiny that you can see your reflection in them or light up a room . but they do have a nice satin sheen to them so they do look really nice . they can easily go from suit to slacks or even some nice higher end jeans and still look great if dressed accordingly so they can get a lot of use . i bought these to go along with a kenneth cole reaction suit separates in black and cannot wait to see them all together on my friend who i bought them for : the fit him perfectly so these shoes run true to size . he loves them , and will definitely be getting plenty of use . 
nice shoes , very soft , very comfy and you can wear it with jeans , slacks or even formal dress pants , i try it as other reviewers suggest it and looks nice , even do a competition with my florsheim formal dress shoes . i don ' t give the full 5 - five stars , based on the wide size , even i ordered wide it was a little bit small than expected . 
i didn ' t pay attention to the waterproof construction which i didn ' t need and which made the shoes quite hot after a long day . the shoes were nicely supportive as rockports always are and looked great . although the size seemed correct , they rubbed my little toes and back of my heels until both were raw . i gave it about 10 days and it wasn ' t getting any better . returned them . 
my husband was looking for a pair of shoes for work . he has flat feet and has had knee surgery so i did my homework before i bought him a pair . he loves them and has not complained once . 
great fit . nice look . adjusted well to my wide feet . goes great with my suit . great quality , not too expensive . 
i ordered this for my boyfriend whose previous toiletry bag was falling apart . it seems to work really well . he has had it for about a year now and it still looks great . it is roomy enough to hold everything he needs without being overly large or bulky . also , the handle on the side is super useful for carrying it . 
i got this bag for my husband last christmas as his current travel toiletry bag was falling apart . i thought based on the price it might be a bit cheap - looking or something , but it is fantastic and he loves it ! the leather is soft , the bag is the perfect size for travel yet holds a lot . definitely recommend ! i looked at a lot of bags before i ordered this one , and i made the right choice ! 
this was a gift for my boyfriend who travels every week for work . he loves it . he says it fits everything he needs for a 3 - 4 day trip and it looks nice . good quality and durable . 
this dopp kit is really nice . i ' ve gotten compliments from my family about it . it ' s not big on organization due to the lack of dividers and pockets , but it ' s large enough to carry everything i need while traveling , looks great , and seems to be durable ( has survived 3 flights and 2 road trips so far ) . 
compact . just right for my needs . not too big , not too small . well constructed . very happy with the one i bought . would buy another . 
i was a little shocked when i opened it & saw it was so small . but ! i was amazed as i started putting full sized products in it & it held everything . really like the handle on the top , it is perfect ! ! 
product is decent looking , perfect for traveling . will recommend to others so please enjoy the product , should suit your needs 
this is a great size toiletry bag . the leather is very rich looking and feeling . would have liked it better if it had inside pockets or dividers . 
i was looking all over the internet for something simple , timeless , manly , yet classy . i didn ' t want anything to big or bulky and this bad did the trick ! apparently it ' s genuine leather and feels really high quality . needs a few days to break - in the leather but when it does . . . ohhh man . i can tell this will last a long time and something i could even pass down to my little brother or children . 
these pants are perfect for warm days . i would recommend getting a waist size larger they fit snug . the length was perfect 
the only reason i subtracted a star is that they were tighter than the other 29x43 ' s that were ordered so they run a little small ; had to be exchanged , but good pants . 
these pants work great for work . they are thin and comfortable and durable . be aware various styles all fit different due to the different cuts and designs of the various styles . 
these are great pants they fit great and are very light weight great for summer time . i have had several pairs and they last for a long time very durable . and the price at amazon is better than anywhere . 
i bought these pants as i wanted some sturdy , khaki work pants without the big bellows pockets that you get with cargo pants . i think we all agree by now that those are not very practical . these pants have a couple of small , well thought out pockets . they hold my phone perfectly , and my sunglasses case . the pants are strong , but light and roomy , like painters pants . i wouldn ' t try to do masonry or firewood with these pants , but they are great for " lighter " labor . i gave them four stars and not five , because unlike every other carhartt product , these pants are sized about right . i love carhartts , and buy a lot of their stuff . usually carhartt runs large , sometimes very large . so with that in mind i bought 36s , and i am like a 35 . but they are a bit snugger than i like my work pants to be . all of my other work pants ( columbia , tru - spec , 5 . 11 ) are 36 , and fit fine . perhaps they will stretch a bit , but i found this to be an unusual exception to the carhartt size " rule - of - thumb " . but very happy with them in ever other aspect . 
i work as an engineer for a general contractor in california and duck carhartt ' s are too hot , so i wanted something lighter but still as durable . they ' re definitely lighter - the canvas breathes much easier and i can wear them in 90 + weather without dying , but the sacrifice for durability is awful . i ' ve had them for ~ 2 months and i ' ve already torn one pocket completely off , have holes in the knees and the crotch seam is starting to wear . the thin fabric also means you can feel everything - kneeling on anything is painful . definitely will not be buying these again , i can ' t afford to replace them every few months . i ' m honestly extremely disappointed because this is the first time a carhartt product has let me down . 
i have to wear khaki colored pants at work . i had found a pair of these on a clearance rack at some point last year and absolutely loved them . those wore out and after buying a few other brands and styles of carhartt , based off what was on sale , i finally decided to just get another pair of these . many of the other pants have very small front pockets or the the opening is too tight , especially if you have larger thighs . these have a fantastic cut to allow for mobility and the pockets are the best of any pant i ' ve used . i will absolutely be buying more of these . 
i ordered these for my son who works in montana . he has worn carhartt ' s for some time and the quality and durability can ' t be beat for outdoor work . i ' m very please with the price and the quick shipping . he ' s very please that he has a sturdy , long lasting pair of work trousers . 
this pair fits very well , nothing to complain there . . . but . . . the fabric is too thin , and in no way this would be suitable for cold ( er ) weather . it does not feel like this pair is made for durability . over all , it fits ok , but if feels . . . flimsy . i will keep it any way , as the summer is close . 
just received the dark olive b151 . . . . they are great . however , 35 " waist fits more like 34 ' s . . . . but i love these pants . . . . and now have every color . . . i wear them to work where i teach school and these are great . . very comfortable with lots of pockets . 
son and husband wear same size carhartt and know what they want in both color and size . shopping in store and online and finding size and color can be challenging . with different styles , one needs to know what they ' re looking for . happily found both for a reasonable price without running from store to store . these are not the really heavy & # 34 ; hate to wash & # 34 ; variety but the weight that allows you to still bend your leg . and yes , ordered two pair . strong points all around . 
they came pretty long , so they had to be hemmed , but not a big deal . they are very comfortable , i would have been happy with one more pocket , they have the hammer loop , the usually 4 pockets , plus one thin pocket on right leg . i could have used another on left . but all in all good pants . i use them for security , and walk all day with no chafing ! ! 
these multi - pocket summer weight pants are sturdy and very comfortable . i ' ve already crawled around on concrete and gravel in them and they ' ve been washed many times , yet they still look like new . would definitely buy again . 
these are the lightest 100 % cotton work pants that i ' ve found . i like them because they are comfortable , breathable and loose fitting . the fit is good as well , as seems to be the case with all of the carhartt products that i ' ve tried . i ' ve had six pair for a little over a year and they are showing a few signs of wear , but nothing major as of yet . because of the wear and also the fact that the price has gone up , i give them a three . 
good work pants , a little thinner material than i am used to getting from store at the mall , but still do the job 
mens size is not accurate . waist was small , the fit was not at all right . i would not recommend these pants . 
i really do like these jeans ( pants really ) they fit perfect and the leg pocket is the perfect size for my blackberry . for the money you cant go wrong . 
lots of subtle pockets on both hips are what makes these pants nice . many of us need those extra pockets for things like , keys , wallet , phone , large pocket knife , mini pocket knife , pistol , etc . these pants accommodate your edc every day carry items . the key word is & # 34 ; subtle , & # 34 ; and carhartt did a great job integrating these pockets in a way that doesn ' t draw too much attention . 
first - these pants do not even come close to the carhartt ' s i have purchased in the past . it really makes me wonder if they are real carhartts . second the sizing is not even close ! if you take a 36 waist and you order a 36 be prepared to send them back . even though they will be marked as a 36 they will seem more like a 32 waist 
i have tried a number of these pants over the past few weeks . i have been looking for a durable pair of pants to use for work around the house . but i wanted a pair of pants i could keep on when stepping out for lunch or picking up the kids . these pants fit well , have great pockets . . . . just perfect . i even played a quick game of hockey with my son & fell in the street . the pants held up great with no rips or tears . i ' m going back to buy more soon . 
i bought pants 40 & # 34 ; on amazon pants without any problem , i ventured to buy these pants the same size but turned out to be much smaller . . . . 
they run small order up one size bigger light weight limited colors and baggy in the hips other than that cathartic 
i was surprised how comfortable these are . the color is the same as the photo , which i am seeing is rare on amazon clothing . it isn ' t really a charcoal color as you can see by the photo , but that is fine with me . the & # 34 ; cell phone pockets & # 34 ; are kind of useless with any newer phone , but i like the look anyway . they mean flip phones and whatnot , it won ' t fit an iphone or samsung galaxy . i ordered my normal length with 1 size up waist , and it fits perfectly . my normal waist size would have been too tight . glad i bought these . 
very good quality , if you order these pants you must order the next size up . i am a true 33 waist and these pants are 34 and just fit . 
poor quality , not rugged enough for todays work projects and cannot stand up to the carhart name brand i know so well 
once you know your size , getting them via amazon is great . these pants are durable and fit great . 
i couldnt be happier with these pants . they were exactly what i was looking for . not too dressy and durable . the size was accurate too . 
most carhartt pants are too high waisted for my husband , but these fit the bill . they are a very competitive price on amazon and fit right for the man that doesn ' t want his pants under his chest . he likes his pants just under his belly . he ' s 50 . we ordered the 32 length which is his usual size and thought they were too long when we got them but after washed , they are a great length and none too short . just right . he ' s glad carhartt is finally seeing a market for the below waist fit . 
when the package bearing this jacket arrived at my door , i thought there had been a mistake with my order because it seemed too heavy to contain only one garment , but no , it was just this jacket . this sucker is heavy , extremely well constructed , and totally impermeable to the hardest rain . it ' s the kind of thing you would expect people to wear aboard fishing boats in bad weather . the only downside to this kind of heavyweight rain jacket is its lack of breathability ; fortunately , the button - snap opening permits some ventilation to avoid perspiration buildup . a great jacket for cold , wet weather that will last most people a lifetime . 
this coat is very heavy . great for heavy rain , but not something you would wear " just in case . " be advised that it runs very large , i would strongly recommend ordering a size down . 
like the coat , definately keeps you dry . the hood is ridiculously huge as with another carhartt rain coat i had purchased previously . i am sure there are certain professions and situations where a huge hood would be a benifit but if you are looking for just a regular raincoat , i would probably get something else . 
ordered this for my husband who needed to replace an old worn - out rain jacket . this carhartt is heavy enough for any outdoor job . . . it ' s also a " hanger bender " . . . . so you might want to store it folded . it most certainly will take a rugged guy to carry this jacket around on his back . as a gal who buys men ' s jeans and boots on a regular basis for all the barn and garden work i do , this is one " men ' s " jacket just for men . go for it guys ! 
i ' m 6 ' 0 " and 210 pounds , and i ordered an xl like i do with everything else . i know they make these on the large side to accommodate the extra clothing you might wear underneath , but this thing was huge . even wearing a t - shirt , a sweatshirt , and a jacket underneath , i felt i was wearing a tent . i sent back my xl and ordered a large . i also switched from the yellow color to the green . i was originally thinking of also bicycling in the coat , but the bulkiness of it made that impractical , so i went with a color that wouldn ' t stand out so much watching a sporting event in the rain . the large fits me perfectly , with or without layers underneath it . it ' s not a long coat , which means you should look into getting the matching pants : carhartt mens lightweight pvc rain bib . and this jacket is on the heavy side , which is good for the cold , but you might also want to check out their lightweight version of the coat , sans pockets : carhartt mens lightweight pvc rain coat . i also like the way it looks , as i would feel comfortable wearing this anywhere . the hood is detachable , there are buttons instead of a zipper in the front , the three pockets are velcro , and there is a liner of sorts on the wrist that prevents water from going up your arm . overall , for $ 40 , this is one of the best deals out there , once you get the correct size . 
* update : the hat is too small - water dripped into my eyes . the length is just too short , the part of the pants that cover my thigh is drenched . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i got this raincoat as a gift . the yellow raincoat is just what i ' ve been looking for . it is the kind of raincoat you see sailors wear it all the time at the sea . i love the design and the color - with wellington rubber boots , the combo makes anyone looks snappy . i can never wear this raincoat during summer though , it is totally unbreathable . it made from very tough material and is heavy ( it weighs 3 . 25 pounds ) for even size xs . the raincoat is also super huge - must order a size down . another issue of this coat is the length - i guess they can ' t make it anymore longer because of the weight of the material , but it really does not cover it all . parts of my thigh are not covered by the raincoat and the rain soaks right into the fabric of my jeans and it is a horrible feeling to wait for it to dry up . overall , it is an excellent raincoat and will last you for a lifetime . 
as so many others have said here , these are a little big . not so much in overall size , but in torso length . because of this i selected large instead of xl , and it fits fine . another positive is the sleeves are slightly longer than normal , which is great . better to have the sleeves bunch a teeny bit , than have them too short . i ' m a little bit of a knuckle dragger , so the sleeve length is perfect . stitching and material are high quality . you won ' t be disappointed . 
wish i had ordered more the first time around . like other reviewers have mentioned , this shirt runs large . the best size and cut for me is normally an xl trim / athletic fit shirt . due to the comments about sizing i ordered a large and it fits perfectly . the shirt is a bit on the long side too so if you don ' t normally tuck in your shirt , this might be overly long for most guys ( i ' m 6 ' 3 " ) the overall quality of this shirt is excellent - i ' m ordering another after i finish this review . the shirt has a nice cut and texture and the color ( mine ' s red ) is perfect and but not overly bright . 
good quality and the carhartt name didn ' t disappoint . sizes run big , so prepare to order small or shrink it in dryer . beautiful color choices . given as gift so long term review not yet availble . 
a bit tight after washing and then drying on hot . the torso is not too snug ( even for someone who is a tad fat ) , but the arms are slightly tight . it fits more like how a long underwear shirt fits . i wonder if that is how it is supposed to fit . it is still slightly too long after drying . the shoulders fit me perfectly . i got the xl - tall and i am usually an xl who needs a slightly taller size . the sleeves widen out after wearing ! turns into a great fit . if you have large biceps or forearms it might be a tad snug . one thing to note is that it does not have a front pocket . - - - i wonder if the http : / / www . amazon . com / gp / product / b002g9u8za / , the regular style carhartt henley , fits the same as the textured one ? anyone have any idea ? i have the http : / / www . amazon . com / carhartt - workwear - pocket - sleeve - t - shirt / dp / b008g7im18 / non - henley long - sleeve t - shirt as well , and that one is much less snug . [ i edited this review 2013 - 03 . ] 
this is a very good fitting and comfortable shirt . medium to heavy weight construction great for every day wear in the fall and winter . value priced and quick delivery , true to size shown . 
this shirt shrinks a lot after washed . it was cut over - sized , so i bought a size smaller , but after washed , it became true to size . that said , the shirt i bought for my husband ended up being one size too small . 
i ' m real happy with the quality of this shirt . the fabric is nice . it has held up good in the wash too . it looks pretty good on me too , if i do say so . 
super comfortable and higher quality than expected from what i paid for it . was not itchy or uncomfortable at all and fits nicely . 
this garter and long is sweet and delectable . . ilove the fact that i can wear it with multiple teddys . . . my boyfriend thought it was hot . . i was even ablt to attach knee high socks to the garter . . . . delicious . . . . . 
have been looking for a garter belt that fit , thank you . plan to order more just to have a back up , put out more colors like red and white 
i couldn ' t believe this . it ' s so small in size and there is no give to the elasticity in it at all . going back . i ordered the biggest size and i ' m not sure even a stick figure could fit into it . it ' s sooooo tiny . 
i ' m really pleased with the product . i agree with other reviewers who say this is perfect for a little bedroom action and not so much for an all - day wear . not that i personally have any reason to wear a garter belt under daywear , so i certainly wasn ' t shopping for that reason . this is definitely not the height of comfort , but it ' s still a fun thing to throw into the mix . it ' s not complicated to use , and mine arrived in perfect condition with no malfunctioning pieces . the best thing about it in my opinion is the look . it ' s got a lovely , sexy lace detail . it ' s very delicate . it doesn ' t resemble anything that could pass for typical everyday undergarments , which is the whole point of my purchasing one . it ' s not bulky at all . i ' m glad i purchased this brand . ones i ' ve seen in local stores ( department , not of the adult variety ) were either too stodgy looking or very bulky . obviously , it has to be laundered as you would any extremely delicate item - - hand wash only , and even that should be done very carefully . the delicateness that i love as the look also makes it a bit difficult to wash . so far mine has not torn or worn thin , but it wouldn ' t take much force to damage it . then again , with a price like this , one could have tons of fun with the item , wash it as many times as one needs , and not necessarily go into convulsions if the item didn ' t provide years of often use , if you get my drift . overall , i ' m very happy with this item and have purchased it in different colors . 
don ' t get me wrong . i love these and they look really sexy on my girlfriend . the quality is surprisingly good . the stockings are not very durable , but what do you expect for this price ? the only real problem is that they are made for someone with at least 35 " hips . the garter quickly drooped on my size 2 girlfriend . that is why i deducted a star . 
the lace material is of poor quality ; the garter belt seems to pinch in all the wrong places and doesn ' t stay adjusted ( so basically it doesn ' t hold your stockings up ) . the matching thong has a synthetic liner , and is made cheaply . 
i really liked this garter at first , but it didn ' t hold up . first the little thing that allows you to adjust the size broke , and then one of the straps came off , on the day of a photo shoot , and i had to pin it and fake it . too bad , cuz it was a cute belt . i guess i ' ll replace the hardware , but it will cost me more than the garter in the long run . 
what a great little lace garter belt ! i was concerned since it was listed as & # 34 ; one size & # 34 ; , but after receiving it , it fits me perfect . i have a 29 & # 34 ; waist , and it does have a little stretch giving it some room for different sizes . i absolutely love the delicate and feminine lace . it is extremely sexy , and love the way it looks on me . and the price was great ! if you are looking for an inexpensive garter belt that looks great and functions perfectly to keep your thigh - high stockings in place , this is it ! looks terrific with my lace - top stockings and stiletto pumps ! 
this item is exactly what you pay for . the material is on the cheap side and very fragile . the garter is not substantial . the model in the photo is very petite , so the garter looks wider than it actually is . the waist is adjustable , but it runs small . i tried it around my waist at its largest setting . it fit , however , the fabric was distorted and did not lay flat . i wear a size 6 - 7 . i think this would probably look nice on someone who is smaller . don ' t even think about it , if you have a muffin top . this will probably not hold up for everyday wear . i own several garters , and this one does not compare in quality . it would be fine for someone looking for an inexpensive garter to spice up & # 34 ; the bedroom & # 34 ; . the actual appearance of the item isn ' t bad and the thong style is o . k . i did not receive stockings with it , as some of the other reviews stated . 
it ' s pretty flimsy , wouldn ' t hold up in the washing machine . however , it ' s fine for the price . it wouldn ' t actually hold up your stockings for all that long , but that ' s not really what it ' s for . looks good , and that ' s what counts with this sort of product . 
i was worried that this item might be too cheap or not fit right . i am 150 lbs and 5 ' 7 " but i often have to get plus size tights ( and sometimes plus size lingerie ) due to being very hippy . but this is stretchy enough that the regular size fits comfortably . it looks very good and works well as a garter belt . worth the 10 bucks . 
i love this thong and garter belt set it is very sexy and looks way more high quality then the price tag would suggest . i will be back for more . leg avenue makes impeccably great and affordable lingerie . 
it came as expected . i wasn ' t too picky , just needed them for a doctor costume . after one wash , i don ' t think they will be around for that long but , they serve their one purpose . 
if you like thongs but belt was not useful as i still do not have thigh high white stockings . . . hmm 
this is your classic garter belt . holds up my thigh heghs and oes the job . i have worn this aaaaaaaaaaaaall day at times , with skirts or drresses or just to e ready . i would recommened this to anyone interested in a fisrt time garter belt . i would like to check out differant colors and styles but for this price it can ' t be beat . 
i knew that for the price i wouldn ' t be getting anything fancy , but they probably could have tried a little harder . the one i got was pretty poorly made : the two adjusters on the left side were a pretty obvious cream color which didnt match the white of the actual belt itself and the other two adjusters . those two were also sewn on lopsidedly , it kinda looks like : v | | sooorrta like that . i dont know how to upload a picture or anything , but that ' s the closest comparison i can do lol . its really not that big of a deal : i ' m going to try to buy bleach to take the color out of those straps and make them match , and i ' m either going to try to detach and re - sew them on symmetrically orrrrr just cover that up by sewing on some bows on top . maybe both . but the item is the one shown in the picture , but you never get to see the back . its kinda just like a short bra strap adjuster and thats it . nothing fancy , and nothing really pretty either . . . : / i ' m on the smaller side , and this i think would fit a rangle of people with larger hips . however , i have maybe 33 & # 34 ; - ish hips and i found this to be a little big . i might just cut off the adjuster in the back altogether and it ' ll fit me right ; the material itself is stretchy enough on its own . 
my wife always tells me to buy her medium . i bought this in medium and it fits her well . it seems like good quality . 
this is a great scarf or shemagh . i bought this a few weeks ago and really enjoy it . it is very nice quality . 
after reading many reviews , i decided to purchase this rothco shemagh in purple . there were none of the flaws other people reported . no loose threats , no offensive odor . it was made in india and i washed it twice . the color did not fade . it did not shrink . the measurements are 42x42 . 5the fabric is not too thin , not too thick and it feels soft . i am absolutely pleased with this scarf . i liked this shemagh so much , i ordered another one . i just wanted to tell you the difference . my second shemagh came from army universe for basically the same price . they had a color , black and silver , that rothco did not have . the army universe shemagh is made in pakistan . there was no bad smell but a few loose threats . there were also some flaws in the pattern and the fabric was not woven as tight as the rothco one . it was not as soft and it was smaller 38 " x 41 . 5 " overall , the rothco shemagh looks better and feels better . today , i have received my third shemagh and now i can compare it with the regular rothco and also one from army universe . this one is foliage green - which is more a gray with a tint of green , a very nice , camouflage color . it actually smelled nice but i washed it anyway , like all new clothes . i was surprised that the water stayed clean unlike the other two shemaghs which i had to wash twice and rinse a few times . there were a few loose threats and minor mistakes in the pattern . it is supposed to be lightweight but i hardly noticed a difference . it is soft , like the other shemagh from rothco andit is the largest of the three with 43 " x 43 " overall the quality was like the shemagh from army universe . i see very little difference in a shemagh made in india or pakistan . being able to compare the three different fabrics , i came to the conclusion that i will buy my next shemagh based on price and color 
this is the real deal . the tactical shemagh here isn ' t one of those thin , useless fashion ones , but a thick cotton one that actually can protect your eyes and nose from the sand , or your face from the cold weather ( which is what i ' m using it for these days ) . a lot of airsoft players are using these too for face and neck protection , and this version will do the job nicely . it ' s hard to say much more about something like this . the size is right , it offers good warmth during the winter , and the tassels aren ' t too long . this is 100 % cotton , made in india , and doesn ' t itch . if you ' re sick of trying to decide on which shemagh to order here on amazon , since there are so many , you can stop looking now and order one of these . heck , order a couple since they don ' t cost much . ' can ' t go wrong with the classic black and white or olive , but all the colors look good . 
very soft and nice during the winter months or keeping the sun off of you in spring or fall . breath able , durable , thick . 
although my wife says i look like a terrorist wearing this while walking the dog it does a great job of keeping you warm in the winter and cool in the summer . 
another great shemagh . i own these in several colors . remember to do the triple - dip when you first get it . fill up a bucket or large pot with enough warm water to submerge the scarf . give the scarf a couple squeezes under the water and let it sit for 20 minutes . after 20 min , wring it out in the sink and replace the dirty water with new fresh warm water . submerge the scarf again and soak for another 20 minutes . repeat this process one more time and air dry over your shower curtain rod , or on a clothesline . this process will help bleed some of the fresh ink out of it so it won ' t stain when wet . it will also help to soften it . 
i feel this would be more fall / winter / spring use if anything . i was planning on using it hiking in the arizona desert but i think it ' s just too heavy . plus , i ' m still trying to memorize the ways to wrap this thing ; - ) 
this will protect you from the sun , wind , sand , etc . many tactical uses . . comes out of the bag kind of smelly . wash it before tactical deployments . for some reason only the british military are using these . you think it ' s a villain but then he does a ninja roll , whips off the shemagh and is like ' jolly good show old boy but i suggest we make haste ' . then he lays down covering fire as you make a break for it . i keep one in my desk at work . this and a bottle of water will get you down the smokey fire stairs in one piece . but i advise against wearing this on the subway . 
nice and stylish arabic scarf . but written - made in india . may be in pakistan ? : ) quality could be better . 
i have many brands of these things . some had issues . the rothco ' s faired better than others . the rothco shemaghs came in and the stitching was as expected . its not a tight stitched nor heavy garment and isn ' t meant to be . if you wash these the stitches will & # 34 ; plump & # 34 ; and it will make the material feel rough which i hate . i suggest hand washing only and hang drying . the material is thin enough for this to be a non issue even indoors . one of the pluses i had with these was a lack of smell attached to the product . other brands i got just flat out got their stank on . these did not stink . i haven ' t gotten into washing them either , but an issue i also had with others was the dye bleeding badly . i suggest a thorough hand wash to check for dye bleed upon receiving any of this type of product just in case . overall : material is thick enough but i ' d like thicker , stitching is fine , colors are true to picture , size is true 
i don ' t know what i was expecting but what i got was not it . i personally am not a fan . the material is super thin and it feels like a cheap tablecloth around my neck and face . 
this scarf is cheap and that is its best attribute . it is absolutely useless for any form of protection . in fact , it is so thin that is practically thread bare . you can actually see through it . the sellers markup on this product must be tremendous . i would have returned it but in addition to the return postage they have the nerve to charge you a 15 % restocking fee ( as if to throw this piece rubbish back on the shelf is worth a couple of bucks ) . like most foreign products this scarf is not only a waste of money but also a piece of trash - you get what you pay for . buy u . s . a . - you may pay a bit more but you get a reliable & substantial product . colonel 
i bought a terrible quality shemagh of a different brand a while back . dye ran , the weave was very loose , and it just felt like horrible quality . this one is way more like it . it ' s light and airy , like it should be , but substantial enough in the weave to serve the variety of purposes that most people hope to keep a shemagh around for . it filters particles , blocks sun and wind , wraps nicely , and is accurately measured . true to color , too . which is nice . i was prepared for this to suck , and was very pleasantly surprised by how much it didn ' t . if i ever needed another for whatever reason , i would be perfectly happy buying another of this same type . 
i purchased two of these shemaghs , and they are very high quality . its funny how versatile they can be . i have used them in tactical , business casual , and dress occasions . its all about how you fold and tuck these shemaghs , as you can manipulate them to have many appearances . i use these as scarfs in the deep winter just because they can tuck deep into your shirt to keep you warm , and still look decent . the material is nice and soft , doesn ' t irritate the neck as some rougher materials do , and holds its color after many rounds through the washing machine . the patterns are also nice . tactically , these are impressive ! they are very large , do a great job blocking the sun / heat of the desert , and remain lightweight . many of my friends are still using these when deployed . this shemagh is tough ! ! ! well worth the money . . 
want warmth ? want protection from the wind ? want protection from the sun ? this is a must - have wardrobe staple for anyone . until you have bundled your neck and shoulders ( and even your head ) with a real shemagh on a cold , windy day , you will never realize the comfort that you have been missing ! like me , you will wonder how you ever did without it . : ) these will wrap virtually any way you want them to and stay put . and they are just beautiful . . . not only functional , they are a popular trend in high fashion these days , too ! 
we have not washed this as i believe was recommended prior to wearing but my boyfriend has been wearing it to walk the dogs . it is a nice scarf / head cover and it looks good on him . 
nice coloration and feels soft . i like that the fringes come already knotted into tassels so that the edges don ' t rats nest and look terrible . 
i might suggest the olive drab camo for any paintball games or other sneaky - sneakiness , but other than color , they ' re all fairly high - quality scarves by rothco . i bought this one , the od and the sand / desert camo patterns , and i like this foliage pattern the least . not for the hipster really . they ' re a little too heavy and long for just a fashion statement . plenty long enough to wrap your neck a few times , just right to wrap your face if you want to look ridiculous . decent price and probably as low as you ' ll find anywhere . recommended . 
this is a very comfortable , multi - functional item . . . great face cover to keep you warm , but with still amazing breath - ability . i plan to order another color or two in the future . . . and these things just look cool as well : ) 
the black and white scarf has a nice and authentic design . however , the material leaves a lot of hairs specially if worn with darker clothes . somewhat poor quality , i believe . 
great schemagh , very durable and everything you would want in one and more , i would definitely recommend to all my friends ! 
nothing like a good shemagh ! this one is very pretty , well - made ( from what i can tell ) , and comfortable as both a scarf and a headwrap . there were a few strings handing on it when i got it , but they came off fairly easily . if it disintegrates when i use it , i ' ll update this review . 
one of the reasons i like this scarf is that it does not get sweaty like a wool or fleece scarf . 
i was actually very surprised with the two of these i ordered . very good strong thread and is good for many things including a tournoquet . i probably spelled that wrong but oh well you get the point . works great in hot weather as well or windy days here in the desert . 
this is a great head scarf . i ordered black / white , and intend to also order the tan / black . the description says it measures 42 ' by 42 ' but , after washing and drying ( without any fading or bleeding ) , mine measures 45 ' by 45 ' . it can be tied about the head as a regular head scarf , about the neck for warmth , or about the face to protect from blowing sand , blazing sun , pollen , etc . for instructions on how to tie , there are several good videos on youtube . 
when i go shooting outdoors all my gear is getting beat down by the sun and can get very hot , i use multiple items to cover up my gear from those camo burlap nets you get in wally world when hunting stuff goes on sale to sniper veils to shemaghs . i use the shemagh when i am shooting outdoors and it is super hot and the sun is beating down . i will drape it over the my head and part of the rifle to help shield the sun . this also helps with dust on very windy days so i am not eating a bunch of sand . i have not washed this particular one , but i have washed and dried a green version by a different company and be careful and just let it air dry do not use dryer or it will shrink and lose its shape . 
i like my olive drab shemagh scarf . the pattern works well with my camouflage , the cloth is supple yet definitely rugged , and it ' s quite versatile . larger than many bandanas i ' ve had , i can do more with this scarf . it ' s great for keeping me warm or cool , protecting me from the elements , biding and carrying things , or helping me camouflage things . draped over some of my gear , it helps break up telling silhouettes , and helps it blend in with surroundings . depending on your social circles , they can also be fairly stylish . i ' m quite pleased with this particular shemagh , as it feels of higher quality than the ones i got from a local outfitter . 
shemaghs are great travel accessories . i ' ve used mine to keep sand and sun off of me in egypt and jordan , used it as an impromptu blanket in a freezing cold hostel in singapore . sure , the " fashionably trendy " scarves might look cool but if you need to keep warm and cool , this is what to get . the quality is first - rate and feels solidly constructed . it hasn ' t bled or frayed with a few washings . a must for travelers . 
i ' m sold on this shemagh . got one in foliage and i like the look , fairly low - key . cheap price , high value . good quality . very light . incredibly comfortable . now i gotta have it on hand all the time as a scarf or covering . i ' m ordering more . 
large , light and soft . measurements were true and color is perfect . i don ' t understand why , but the green shemaghs i own all seem to be better quality than any of the others . ( i have many colors by many manufacturers ) no matter how tight the weave is said to be . . . . . when held up with a light source behind you will still be able to see through . the loose weave helps to trap air for cooling / heating purposes . this is a shemagh . if you want a tighter weave buy different fabric at a craft store . either machine or hand wash in hot water alone or with like colors 2 or 3 times before wearing . do not dry in machine drier ! it will shrink and fabric will pucker due to weave . line dry . tassle knots will loosen during wash . i keep one of these in every pack i own . which is a few . 
haven ' t given this the field test yet but it seems to be of good quality . great price point . we ' ll see hw it holds up in the wash and out in the field but right out of the box looks good . 
look no further ; these rothco shemaghs are the real deal . the pattern is sewn on and not printed with dyes , it ' s full size and not a smaller version of the real thing and the cotton is light enough to breathe through but not too thin to be flimsy . i always have at least one shemagh with me outdoors and can spend all day in the desert sun with one wrapped firmly around my head . 
alright , i have no basis with which to really judge a shemagh . i ordered one to create costume and it worked perfectly for that . however , as an avid traveler i could easily see how one of these would come in handy for a backpacking trip ( hostel backpacking or legit backpacking ) . it works great to keep sun and other elements out . also , could easily be used to sit on picnic style or use as a very light blanket . it is very light material as well . all in all this worked out to be perfect for me . if you wear these as part of your religion or ethnicity i imagine you will have much more experience with shemaghs than i do , but this seems to be a well made shemagh . it gets my stamp of approval . 
it can be a pain to fold / wrap into an ideal shape , and it ' s not the warmest or fanciest - looking scarf ( it ' s meant to be used in heat / sand as well ) , but it ' s a bit longer than other scarves and has a distinctive look . i gather some people associate it with a certain view of middle eastern politics , which i hadn ' t anticipated , but that seems like a minor concern . i haven ' t really ever used it to cover my mouth or face , but it ' s nice to know i can if we ever get a sandstorm in ny . 
after initial washing design tightens into what was advertised . with rope halo in place fixed to head with out flapping to much in high wind . 
it does what we wanted it to do . it works well for winter and summer . many reviews objected to the smell and quality of the fabric but i don ' t find any issues with either . 
good bargain schemagh . they are lightweight and a light weave but cheap enough that you can buy another one if you wear it out . it will work as a winter scarf despite being thin . when rolled and doubled up it keeps out the wind . since it is cotton it will pull heat from your neck / body when wet . that can be a benefit in the summer but if it gets wet from melted snow in the winter its a disadvantage . overall satisfied . my original one is holding up well but i have yet to machine wash it . more to come . 
these are great , and i have bought a few . pretty simple product . two things to know when buying a shemagh1 ) only get 100 % cotton2 ) shemagh should be a perfect square 40x40 or so 
i am not going to use this item so i only gave it 4 stars for appearance , colour & style . it looks nice & comfortable , i would wear one if someone bought me one as a gift . i changed my rating to five stars as recipient enjoys it . 
need to stock up on these , they are sexy and sturdy . my honey really loves them . the one size fits well , i ' m size 12 . 
these were better than i expected . they almost look like velvet , but they stretch beautifully , fit great . very happy with this product . 
i have to stretch and tug them a bit to get them on and , yet , they don ' t tear ! these are excellent quality . i have worn them 2 times and had no issues . i highly recommend them ! 
these are great white fishnets ( they are hard to find ! ) for a nice low price . i ' m 5 ' 10 " and 150 lbs and they fit me well . these are perfect for your halloween costumes . . . and a lady can never have too many pair of fishnets on hand . : ) 
worked out great for the one time i needed them . used for a costume , shipped ontime and i was shocked but the one size did work . might be fun to try on other colors next time . 
these were perfect ! i wore them for halloween and received so many compliments . i ' m sure i ' ll be wearing them again ! 
i have been buying and wearing leg avenue products for years and have never had anything bad to say about them ! 
i love these stockings . for the price , you cannot beat it . they also very cute on and sexy . i got them quickly too . good buy ! 
industrial refers to the size of the net , not the strength of the hose , but they are durable nonetheless . use ' em regularly for roller derby , and they stand up pretty well . 
the wife wanted these to go along with an old time looking outfit she did for a church dance , and looked very sexy in it all . 
i bought these in neon pink for my rave outfit because i couldn ' t find them in any stores . they are exactly what i was looking for , but i think they are meant for people with smaller thighs than me even though i am a size 3 / 4 . still work great though . 
no complaints , they are fishnets . did the trick . they were comfortable and fit fine . i am 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; and 120 lbs . 
i am of sm - med build and this did not want to stay up on me . they do however look great under a blacklight ! 
my wife absolutely loves these fishnets ! they have no problem staying up on their own , are nice and comfy , and feel amazing to touch . you won ' t be disappointed ! 
they fit me well . i ' ve never owned this color of panty hose before . they are fun and sexy . i ' m going to get every color of fishnets after discovering the many colors . these came in a timely manner . 
just had to have that differant shade . fence net has larger spacing so there differant but they work just great . 
item received quickly and in great condition . love the detail of the stocking , hard to find them in stores . i ' m 5 ' 7 and very thin , so that as well makes it a challenge to find stockings that fit . these are still a little baggy , but i love them ! definitely a great purchase ! 
packaged well , exactly as shown . good quality . makes your legs look very sexy . i have long legs and they fitted me well . 
they are cute , sexy and very good quality , i like how they fit and they aren ' t made of in a cheap manner . 
i purchased these and they are awesome . they are easy to get on and dont rip like some of the others i have tried . the rubber grips around the thigh make them stay in place for a long time without sliding down and falling down . they are nice . 
these are fun , stretchy and have a sticky strip to help keep them up , even though i use them with garters . 
lace part has sticky thingy to stuck to thigh but wont hold . ok quality product . the fishnet holes are too big for toes and all ten of them will come out funny . 
this is hot . i can ' t really add more , but it turns any woman into a sexy diva ! oh yea ! hot ! 
i am 5 ' 6 & # 34 ; and weigh 118 lbs . these make my legs look absolutely terrible . i actually was so frustrated in them that i threw them away . these were the first pair of stockings that i purchased and i will probably not buy another pair . i wear a size 0 - 2 pants and these squeezed my legs so tight and made my thighs look like i had huge amounts of cellulite . i do not recommend this product . 
these net with wide lace top and silicone stay up strips are extremely sexy and look durable . will certainly outlast a regular stocking by many times . pulls on very easily . 
arrived quickly and they are very nice and good quality . it is hard to tell from the picture , but these are large nets , not the small you might imagine . 
they look a little different than the image but they are still very sexy . my boyfriend loved them ! just one thing - the material is not very comfortable so i wouldn ' t were them out for a long time . 
needed a pair to match a lingerie set i bought . they are adorable on and the color is vibrant . id recommend this item many times over . 
the only complaint i have is the lace part at the top sort of rolls under and sticks to the stay put silicone stuff . it like rolls inward towards my thighs . also i did not think ahead before buying these but lucily i realized anyhow - you need to check a mirror and make sure these are even on both of your thighs so that one isn ' t higher than the other . but they are really nice looking . my husband likes them , of course ! just expect them to take a few extra minutes to put on for the 2 forementioned reasons i listed . i loved the quality . i only have worn them 1x so far but they seem durable and they are relatively comfortable . i ' m 5 ' 10 " tall i cannot wear shorter than a 34 " inseam pant but i buy pants up to a 38 " inseam . . . these fit a little long even on me ! so someone 5 ' 0 " may have to pull these clear up to the tops of her legs ! as a tall woman , i love these and may buy more pairs later . 
not so good for a woman thats 5 & # 34 ; 11 & # 34 ; and 160 pounds . seems like the quality is fine though . can still wear this but i squeeze out the top a bit . : ( 
the one size was true to its word , fitting me perfectly . and they really stay up through thick and thin , without the traditional garter support . i bought them in black and will definitely try other colors as well . 
i purchased this item and never before did i have muffin top thighs . so , i cut the tops off and because the length was a little long they still worked with my garters . i ' m a bit weird about things and really don ' t like to throw away things , so i sewed the two tops i cut off together so the rubber touched and used that as a choker and added some detail . sounds strange , but i got plenty of praise from my girls and it looked great with a low cut top . after a few uses of these , i can tell i will be recycling them for some other weird use i can find online . other than that , my man loved the fishnet look and so my search for the right brand continues . 
nice quality but did not stay up keeps sliding down kind of annoying , just sitting in my closet , consider that 
beautiful , sexy stockings by leg avenue . i bought them because i feel that no woman ' s wardrobe is complete without at least one ( preferably more ) cute pair of fishnet stockings . and guess what ? i ' m glad i did ! these stockings are cute and really make my legs stand out . the lovely lace trim did a wonderful job of staying where it needed to be . plus , i can tell that these stockings are made ( particularly when you consider how reasonable the price is ) to last a long time . great job by leg avenue ! 
arrived on time fit was perfect as i am very tall and they are just perfect color nor quality was lost during washing would and will order again 
good product , however , you cannot be under 5 ' 10 " to wear . girth does not factor into this , just height . it ' s all about the length . 
very sexy and comfy . the only reason it was not a 5 star is because it rolls down too often . 
quality product . fantastic hosiery . will buy more of these soon . love love love them . what more can i say . wow 
such a cute bodysuit my husband loved it soft on the skin unlike some looks great on would order again 
i thought i was getting a bodysuit without the arms but i got a full bodysuit instead . i dont know why but this is not what i ordered . it was the same red color and i am just going to keep it since it was only like $ 6 but i was kinda upset to not get what we wanted . 
i am 5 ' 4 & # 34 ; 190 lbs and i had bought one like this in the plus size before . there was too much room in the plus size . this one i wish the legs were longer by a inch maybe . i don ' t have fat legs i am top heavy and the top is roomy . still think its great as my hubby loved it ! 
i like it . my boyfriend liked it a lot . i is verrryy stretchy . i am 104lb and 4 ' 11 & # 34 ; with 32c . i am little but i feel like it would fit for others taller than me . it seems like it could rip easily but i don ' t wear things like this more than once usually . it was very easy to put on . i liked that the halter neck part just slips over my head like a t shirt . 
gotta cut the crotch part bigger other wise you cant get in . . . if you know what i mean . . . ok product . 
i thought it looked great on my lady . . she thought it fit well but was a little rough feeling . . . then again does one plan to wear this very long . 
i tried this one and it looked wonderful ! my husband absolutely love it . it fit my curves perfectly . i am 5 ' 6 1 / 2 170lbs . i was worried that it would not fit but it fit great . my only complaint is that it ripped when i tried it on . i purposely took off my wedding ring that it would not snag ! unfortunately it did . i received the product on time which is great . hope this helps ! 
awesome item for the price . exactly what i wanted . search finally over . trust i was searching for quiet some time . 
not much to say . . . other than enjoy ! ! just as expected - let your imagination run wild - not much really to add again 
its nice . she thought it was comfortable . we had a good time and more ahead . we have a black one too . 
this is something that will move you ; unless red is not your color . material is nice , and the fit is good too . 
my nieghbor want these and asked me to get this for her she said her husband loved it and the red looked nice 
fits great and is super soft . i normally hate to wear leggings but these were great because they were not remotely close to being itchy or uncomfortable . fit me well especially with a garter belt , but i could see that if i wore them multiple times in a row they could start to irritate my thigh . 
all right , let ' s get right down to it ! when it comes down to intimate apparel , there is nothing that captures a man ' s eyes and imagination as thigh - high stockings ! these soft and sexy stockings wear well , and stay up . so , you don ' t need to use a garter , but i do recommend one . ( i don ' t believe in understatement in the bedroom . ) i highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men , buy them as a gift ! 
they ' re very thin and can only be worn a few times until they tear . a garter belt is a must because these will not stay on their own . not bad for the price . 
i am a curvy girl . weighing around 165 and i am 5 foot 4 inches tall . i love stockings that go up to my rear and these don ' t . they do look cute and they do the job . 
they are great for a costume . i wouldn ' t wear them out since they look pretty cheap . up at the top there are random lines of thicker black thread . arrived super quick and they feel fairly sturdy i almost always wear a garter belt but they seem like they ' d do ok without . a fine buy for the money . 
they are strong material , but they slip and roll at the top which is very uncomfortable while wearing them . the seam at the toes is nice but i can ' t wear these for very long because they ' re very uncomfortable when they roll up slide down my thighs , they are tight on me and i have very nice legs_ mrs . bot 
these were a fair pair of stockings for the price . they are not quite as sheer as i had hoped but they fit ok and look ok . i have these in 2 shades black and natural . i am not sure i would buy more but i will wear the ones i have . 
this product does as expected . it ' s as described and helps get the job done . no problems so far they have held up fine 
i like them , they look nice , but they are a little to loose at the top . . . but they still look okay 
there ' s nothing really special about these tights compared to any others , but they ' re worth the money and they fit nicely . 
i actually bought a few more pairs after my first pair came . i love these . they ' re sexy . y boyfriend likes them too ! 
these thigh highs r ok just u do have to be even more careful when wearing those because thy do tend to run easily but thy r very soft and so comfy ! 
my mil is the fussiest person i know . i think this is the first gift i ' ve given her in 15 years she not only kept , but actually loves . likes the way they stay put , block the wind and work with her hearing aids . major success ! 
the perfect ear muff for me . i have a 20 & # 34 ; head band and have difficulty finding earmuffs and hats that fit me well . the & # 34 ; chinchilla & # 34 ; is not a true chinchilla animal . these do not shed as my mink ones or fox do . 
these are really soft and furry on the outside , but the inside as not chinchilla - it ' s the usual inside - the - earmuffs - black - fabric , and they do shed a bit . the band over the head is easy to work ( it doesn ' t twist into a pretzel like many do ) 
at first i did not like these but i wore them a couple times and literally forgot i was wearing them . they are so warm ! my only wish is that the band was adjustable . 
let me preface my comments by saying at no time in the description did the seller state the earmuffs were adjustable . and that is the problem . the ear pieces are super nice and warm , but the headband is not adjustable . i am a small lady , and would like to adjust the head band so the muffs fit over my ears comfortably , but there is no way to do this . the muffs were nice because there is a fabric cover for the plastic head piece . but one size does not fit all , and it would have made the muffs feel ever so much better . i would have even been glad to pay the extra few dollars for this feature . i can ' t attest to the warmth of the muffs because we ' ve hit that january spell in tennessee where we ' ve had to turn on the a / c to keep comfortable . i expect that will not last , and i ' ll be able to report back about the warmth of the fur . 
although i bought these as a gift , i love these boots . they are well made and very cozy . i buy them for all friends as baby shower gifts . you cannot go wrong with robeez as first shoes . 
i love love love these boots . i purchased them for my 8 month old daughter who is not a fan of shoes . however , these are the only pair that stay on . she is just starting to crawl and the are perfect for crawling . i wish they were available in black because they are absolutely adorable with leggings or skinny jeans . i had purchased the riley roos but returned them when i saw these and i am so glad that i did . they are so easy to slip on and off . 
can ' t go wrong with robeez . this style is especially cute . they are so warm and my grandson loves them . they are easy for new walkers to walk in . 
my granddaughter will wear without a fuss . very cute and cozy . the soles get dirty becasue she wears them out and they are suede but i eventually threw them in the wash a few times , they are fine . 
i got two pairs for my grandson , since i knew he ' d grow fast before winter was over . these are nice , soft , foot conforming boots . no , they ' re not waterproof , but they ' re not really meant for kids who are walking into puddles and snow drifts anyway . he was able to walk around on dry pavement just fine . they don ' t have any cushion in the sole , not meant for long walks . absolutely great for keeping his feet warm in the car . 
love these , i get complements on them almost every time we go out . they are great for my daughters chubby baby feet . she has been in them since 9 months when she started walking and still fits them at 15 months so they are definitely worth the price . i have since bought other robeez shoes and would buy more in the future . 
i bought these for my granddaughter to keep her little feet warm but she can pull them off which i was hoping these would prevent . they are adorable and warm looking but unfortunately , she somehow can pull them off while in the car seat . 
i ' ve purchased robeez for my older child when he was learning to walk . so it was obvious i would buy them for my second child . love the soft bottom . helps with learning to walk . strengthens the toes . the color is soft so it ' s wearable with anything . the soft lining is good against the skin . and the elastic is good so i don ' t have to tie anything and they stay on . i even bought a second pair and i was happy to receive a third pair as a gift : - ) 
i got a pair of these handed down in the 6 - 12 months size and they are amazing . they are warm and lined with faux fur so you don ' t have to bother with socks . they are also good for lots of different weather outside from fall to spring . they are also really cute - everyone compliments us when my little girl is wearing them . they are the only shoes she wears . i think once she starts walking , she ' ll need something with a little more structure on the bottom but i think i ' ll get her another pair of these in 12 - 18 anyways . great shoes ! ! 
boot fits better without socks ; however , after i took them off my baby , there was a ring around her leg . so obviosuly they must of been too tight . 
robeez is an excellent company that sells these quality shoes for babies and toddlers . nothing but good can be said about their products , but do wait for the sales , which are always available , as they are a bit pricy . love these little boots ! 
you get what you paid for . i wanted a couple of light sabers to duel with so i ordered two . i was disappointed with their cheapness but for $ 10 i can ' t expect it to be too sturdy . my husband ended up getting me a couple of new sabers that were 3 times as expensive but are so much better . now i ' m not too worried about dueling with these and having them break but don ' t order this if you ' re wanting a durable product . you might as well shell out the money for a better product . 
i purchased this for my 5 year old nephew . i also got him the darth vader costume . he loves the lightsaberand plays with it often when he plays dresss up . 
we have this light saber and thestar wars e3 basic lightsaber bl01 green . this lightsaber was broken after the very first battle ! i couldn ' t believe this light saber was such a flimsy piece of junk that a kid can ' t even pretend to duel with it . what ' s the point ? ? my son was very disappointed , but thankfully my son also has the basic light saber , which has survived the usual 6yo abuse . 
do not expect much of disguise , because almost all of your kind are above $ 100 . if you want something simple and have fun , not so bad . i am 5 8 " and the sleeves fit me . the crotch is very fair to me . if you want to have a party where everyone will look at the genital area , i suggest you buy a larger size . as data , the mask has only the back half is uncovered . 
it did it ' s job . . it ' s huge and the paint isn ' t meticulous , not very sturdy but it functions without a glitch and from afar you can ' t see imperfections . it is a costume saber so it ' s decorative basically . don ' t buy this for your kids or if you wanna play - fight : it will break ! 
it is really flimsy ! it is also curved to one side . button to turn it on is tiny and requires quite an effort to slide . save your money ! 
i think it is a good accessory to complete the darth vader costume . there is a good relationship between price / quality 
my son is going to be darth vader for halloween . we purchased this to add on to the costume . he ' s happy with it . it ' s pretty cheap , and plastic , but that ' s what we expected for the price . overall a good purchase . hope he doesn ' t break it before halloween . 
bought this light saber to make a star wars video where i edited in after effects to make it look real and it worked out fine . 
the darth vader light saber was great . grandson loved it as it was different than all the other ' s he has . good quality , safe to use . excellent price . 
we bought 3 light sabers total , anakin skywalker , mace wandu and darth vader . this is the shortest of the three but the handle seems to be the most sturdy . although the package says it is for costume purposes only and is not a toy i have gotten into some battles with my 4 and 6 year olds and it seems to be holding up well enough . 
i love these t - shirts . i purchased three of them for my son . he thinks they look " cool " . a high quality product that should last . 
black dragon t - shirt is a high quality shirt . the graphics are sharp and clear . the fit is true to size . i would recommend it to a friend . 
i bought this as a gift for my brother , he tells me that he has worn it several times and washed it without it shrinking , so i guess he likes it . recommrnded for people who want a dragon shirt . gunner , august , 2009 
received quicklyfits perfectlyawesome design as my son loves dark arti have never had a problem with ordering tees through amazon or a few of their pro - sellers / vendors ! great quality ! 
i love these shirts from & # 34 ; the mountain . & # 34 ; and when i selected & # 34 ; fit as expected & # 34 ; from the drop - down box for this review , to me , it fits like what i expect a 2xl to fit like . i like shirts with some & # 34 ; room to spare & # 34 ; in their sizing , as i am not a & # 34 ; form - fitting & # 34 ; guy . if you like your shirts to fit snug like they were tailored to your body , then these are not for you . if you like a comfortable loose fit , then these are for you . if there was any down side to these shirts , it would be they are a little long for my taste . i am 6 ' and the 2xl goes more than half way down my thigh . however , if you are a & # 34 ; roomy loose fit & # 34 ; guy like me , then you will appreciate every other aspect of the shirt and just have your wife , girlfriend , sister , or neighbor just shorten the length for you with the ol ' sewing machine if you think it ' s a little long for your taste . a simple minor fix for an otherwise awesome shirt . 
this shirt is beautiful , it arrived super - quik & if my kid had his way he ' d wear it everyday & i ' d have to snatch it off him in his sleep to wash it . as it is i have to hide it on him & only bring it out when asked . . he has others so they placate him temporarily which gives me time to wash it ( in cold ) and dry it ( line dry or put it on a plastic hanger somewhere there ' s good air circulation ) but he never completely forgets it . i swear i just get it clean & dry & put away & guess who wants to wear it ? ? gotta love it whwn ya do somethin right like get the picky kid a shirt he loves . . so far i ' m 5 for 5 with the t ' s wish me luck @ xmas lol ! 
my son thought this was a cool shirt , dragon graphic . shirt is washed / pre - shrunk , 100 % heavyweight cotton . the black shirt looks great . 
i was invited to a birthday party for my future brother - in - law , who happens to like anything having to do with dragons . so i thought i ' d check out amazon to see if i could find a dragon t - shirt to give him for a birthday gift . i found several but this one seemed to be the standout . i liked the dragon image and reviews vouched that the shirt was a good quality . i showed my fiancee a selection of dragon t - shirts who then chose this shirt right away as well . great . the fabric feels smooth and doesn ' t have a thin or chintzy feel to it . at the party everyone oohed and ahhed over the shirt . it was a hit ! my fiancee ' s brother - in - law is not a big talker . the only words he said after he unwrapped his gift were " i ' ll dry this on a hanger , " but we could tell by the look on his face that he really liked it . 
i love this shirt . i had one five years back but it wore out . that one had a front pocket and the dragon on the back . i prefer the dragon on the front . the mountain makes nice quality shirts . there is no icky , scratchy tag in the back , either . very nice shirt . 
this shirt is well made . fits as expected and the graphics are stunning . collecting them for gifts now . recommend anything made by ' mountain ' in the tee shirt area - have several . 
every t - shirt offered from the mountain seem to be of high quality , i have three so far and plan on getting a couple more . heavy , good quality , cotton t ' s , with rich well printed artwork , that usually spans a large portion of the front of the t . this dragon one is no exception , it looks good and meets my expectations on a quality t - shirt 
my husband wore this to hand out candy to the kids and he was a huge hit . i thought he looked handsome in it as well ! 
really love how it fits . the pants are kind of loose but you can fit it using ur imagination . 
as everyone has said , the costume runs bigger so i ordered a medium for my husband who normally wears a bigger medium to a large . the pants are kind of short but the boot covers make up for that by covering the bottom of the pants and over your shoe . the shirt looks great , the bandana is nice , and the wrist strappy things were a nice touch . the belt is a little flimsy but whatever . it ' s a thin costume but not so thin that you can ' t party and move around as you please . my husband wore a t - shirt and normal black pants underneath just to be safe . he wore it all day and it ' s ready for another wear next year , it held up well . i just hung it up a few days before to let some of the wrinkles fall out . this is a pretty complete costume for a fantastic price . highly recommended . 
good costume for the price ( i think we paid 20 $ ) but oh my did it have an awful smell ! the pleather parts of the costume ( belt wrist band and boot covers ) has a very strong fishy odor coming from them and despite my best efforts to wash , freshen and deodorize the smell just kept coming back also the boot cover elastics broke super easy . i ended up returning it . if you are ok with not using the boot covers , belt , and wrist bands then i say go for it because other then the smell it was a very good price for what you got . 
i was looking for a pirate costume to match with my girlfriend . this one was perfect . it fit great , i got a m which is where i should be . the material is pretty good for a halloween costume . the pants are short , but they supposed to be since you get the boot covers . i like the arm bracers , it ' s a nice touch . it doesn ' t come with a sword or eye patch but even without those it still looks like a pirate costume . overall , very happy with my purchase . 
this costume worked great as our pirate captain prop on our haunted pirate ship . just added skeleton gloves and pirate scarf with dread and mask and voila really cool pirate prop . after making huge gator and octopus props i wanted something easy to make . these costumes were perfect . they held up to strong winds and rain too . and they are still in great shape to use next year . 
bought it for my son for purim . i paired it with a pirate hat that was beautifully made and he loved it . i also sent his girl friend a maiden pirate costume . they looked beautiful in their costumes . 
no complaints , it looked great on my boyfriend so i wasn ' t disappointed . i bought the matching outfit , so we were a great pair ! 
we had a family pirate theme this year , and my husband said the costume was overall itchy and uncomfortable . it also looked much more cheesy and cheap in person than it did in the pictures . 
people at my son ' s school gave me & # 34 ; best costume & # 34 ; award for this outfit . it is soooo cheap , but it looked great . i ' m wearing it next year which makes it even better in value . 
bought this for my husband and since he ' s big in the chest and shoulders i always get xl , but this thing was humongous on him , more like a xxxl , hoping i can take it in a bit if not will have to try and find something here he can wear . nice costume just don ' t think it was really true to size its a lot larger . 
ok this costume was really cheap but it looks fabulous on my tall handsome husband and fit him like a glove . he ' s 220 and 6 foot 3 inches if that helps you size . 
looked good on my fianc & eacute ; . we played a sand volleyball tournament in this sucker and he was able to move and jump without it tearing or hindering it . it looked great as well . would buy more costumes from this company again in the future . 
this turned out to be a pretty good pair of pants . they are light weight and the breathable fabric made them even more comfortable . make sure to buy the matching top otherwise the camo pattern won ' t match up with other brand names . 
at the time of this review , i am active duty army . i bought these to replace some of my fracu and regular issue acus . the fit is similar if not the same as standard issue . the color and material are exactly the same as standard issue acus . these fit well and feel that they may even wear better than the standard issue acus or the acus you can purchase at clothing and sales . these do have the buttons on the larger pockets . the velcro on the pockets was a pretty bad idea to start . all in all these are a great replacement for acus if you happen to be looking for a similar price or cheaper acu replacement . 
if you don ' t have a 36 & # 34 ; inseam , don ' t order the long . i ordered ll . i have a 34 & # 34 ; inseam , and had to have a tailor take off 4 inches for another $ 25 . l fits my 38 & # 34 ; waist perfectly . they ' re button - fly , which i wasn ' t expecting but am cool with . . . . back to the 80s ! 
these are the real military acu pants , and if anyone is looking for real us army acu pants and solid trousers , these are the one , great and good fit ! might seem a little large but it is only in order to feel at ease , so perfect 
these look just like the army issue pants in every sense . they are a cotton blend verses the army issue pants so they are lighter which will make them cooler in the summer . perfect for garrison work ; not sure i would buy them for a deployment but for stateside ; save the money and buy these ! 
i got the mirror gradient . gotta agree with one review that called them fragile . im not too active in them at all but feel i need to be extra careful or they ' ll snap in two . taking care of them isn ' t very difficult though so that isn ' t much of an issue anyway . very nice , expensive feeling shades that would look great on almost anybody . they seem a little dark when i wear them say inside the grocery store , but you ' re not supposed to wear them indoors anyway are you ? i ' m sure they ' re real ray - bans , they ' re priced well , and a nice change from the oakley space pilot looking shades that i used to wear . im very happy with my purchase . 
bought these sunglasses for myself but had to give them to 6 year old boy - this is how small those sunglasses are . i think ray - ban rb3183 may work for guys with small faces , and by small i mean really small . quality wise those are as expected . 
i had a pair of these glasses previously and they lasted me about 7 years before scratches on the lenses ( from regular use ) became too much for me to cope with . . . that pair is now relegated to bike rides and running . they ' re lightweight , sturdy , the polarized lenses are a must . i am a big fan as the aviator trend is not for me as they don ' t fit my face shape . considering these were roughly a 1 / 3rd of the cost from the last time i bought them , they ' re a bargain as well . 
rayban has been one of the leaders of sun glasses for years , i ' d rate them up with the big dogs . they look like the kind our war hero ' s are wearing 
i gifted it to my brother , he liked it , , its cheap to buy here as compared to a local store . i will take one more it it goes well for my brother for at least 1 year . . 
i am not sure why but this pair fit me great and looked good in a retail store but upon delivery these did not fit right and looked different , i retuned this pair no problems . these might be good for someone with a larger face . rayban 3179 fit me . 
they keep a nice appearance after several washes and are not too casual to be worn with a tucked in button down shirt . my wife prefers them over my jeans and i have received a few comments on how nice they look . i have bought 2 more pair of them since ( different sizes ) they all look the same and have the same great quality feel . if need be , i will buy more . 
these cargoes are very comfortable and look nice enough for casual situations or work . as some have noted , they do tend to run large in the waist , but not excessively so in my case . i have the british khaki and am ordering the stone today . 
best cargo so soft has so much room for guys who loves roomie pants . . i i wish levis made them again and in different colors . 
these cargo pants are just what i was searching for . i fish and bird hunt . i always need pockets . 
i ordered these for my 6 ' 2 " , 200 lbs husband , in 34 w , 36 l . they were too small round the waist , but in any case they were much too heavy for summer . well made , but not what he wanted . i returned them . 
i ' ve been wearing my levi cargo pants for a couple of weeks now and i love ' em . they ' re loose fitting and baggy and very comfortable . they are definitely for casual activities only ! the material used for these pants is a bit limp for my taste with almost no ' body ' to them . i suppose come summer time these pants will feel a lot better . the front pockets are very shallow , and the material the pockets are made from is very thin and will probably not last very long , from experiences i ' ve been through with pockets of similar construction . they ' re a very comfortable pair of pants , but judging from the material and the construction of the pants , i have a feeling these pants are not very rugged . i also have a feeling that these pants won ' t last very long in my world ! these pants will probably last a year in my world , maybe two if i baby them . 
just buy it , sorry sound a little bit like nike . . . really good pants ! i purchased second pair in one month . the only thing is size difference in according with colorand country of origin . the mustang is made in egypt , but thestone is made in bangladesh and is smaller ( 38x34 ) . . . 
excelente gracias es un articulo echo de calidad y medidas q realmente se espera mil gracias amigos muy buen servicio 
it feels greats it looks better awesome for me at least and is really soft . easy to watch very few wrinkles , just a bit longer than expected . xd 
wenger makes fantastic watches that last for a very long time . they are stylish and very accurate . this particular model is great , easy to wear , very comfortable and is a very nice timepiece . 
my sons helped me pick out a " cool " watch that i could get wet while cleaning or bike riding or removing drywall dust . . . it is a nice size not to small and not to big . i am 5 ' 7 " and the size of the watch matches the scale of my body , if that makes sense . so far it has held up to my busy life i wore it even to do laps in and it is still ticking . . very attractive yet understated all for a reasonable price . . . 
this is my first wenger swiss military watch , i especially like the quick charge luminous hour markers and watch hands , very easy to see in the dark , it is very quite and most confortable to ware with the pig skin band . in my opinion it you are looking for a confortable , quite , easy to read watch at a great price , this is the one . 
awful ! ! ! i purchased this in jan / feb2013 , return date ends as of 05mar2013 and the battery is already dead . this watch lasted less than 6 weeks , i suggest you buy from someone else . 1 ) why would a company have a return policy of less than 6 weeks if they were not selling faulty items ? 2 ) it took darn near 4 weeks for me to receive the item to begin with . i attempted to contact the company before placing a bad review , but their return policy prevented me from doing so , so here it is a bad review . a great watch sold by a awful vendor . 
looks good , feels solid and runs well . nice details like the swiss army knife engraving on the back plate and the wenger logo on the crown . band is squeaky and uncomfortable . swapped it out for something nicer to bring out the watch ' s full potential . 
this is a very nice , rugged watch at a very affordable price for a " swiss made " watch . the wenger model 72900 is a very well made watch for the person with a modest budget . the dial is white with large , green , luminous numerals and bars . this is certainly very easy to see for someone such as myself who now wears bifocals . the minute and hour hands are black with luminous inserts and contrast well with the white of the dial , making them very easy to see . the second hand is a very easy - to - see red color and ticks precisely , hitting the center of numbers or bars - always a good sign of quality manufacture . the face also includes small 24 - hour numbers for those on military time . the case is a an attractive , glare - free brushed stainless steel . the stainless steel back is nicely polished and etched with the wenger swiss army logo as well as it ' s " swiss made " and 100m water resistance designations . the band is a very soft , brown leather that i found comfortable from day one . there ' s no " break in " time for this band . it ' s very nicely stitched and has two " keepers " . it fit me perfectly and still does . it even comes in a nice aluminum " tin " with registration and instruction manual . this watch is a no - frills , simple and - to my mind - attractive watch at a very modest price . i haven ' t found anything yet that i don ' t like about it and give it five stars ! edit : 8 / 4 / 2012 - the watch stopped working after owning it for about a week . i thought perhaps the crown had become snagged on something and pulled out a little bit , thus stopping the watch movement . i reset the time and pushed in the crown and it began working . unfortunately , it has quit twice more . i am returning it to amazon for an exchange . we ' ll see how the next one does . edit : 9 / 4 / 2012 - amazon stood behind the product it sells and exchanged the defective item for new one . the new watch has performed flawlessly since i got it about a month ago and have no qualms . it does pay to buy things from amazon as opposed to their affiliate sellers because amazon generally stands behind its products better and makes returns / exchanges very easy to get done quickly . edit : 2 / 4 / 2013 - after six months , the replacement watch has served me flawlessly . it is quite accurate , gaining only 9 seconds per month - quite good for a quartz watch . it seems reasonably rugged and the band wears well . this is a nice , swiss - made watch for the money . 
i purchase this swiss watch for each child and now each grand child at the age of 10 . this is a well made swiss watch and provide years of service long into college years . highly recommend . 
i was surprised i was able to get such a good quality swiss made watch so cheaply . it just goes to show you that you don ' t have to spend big bucks to get a good product . update : 4 months on and i still love this watch . it ' s a perfect watch to beat down . it keeps perfect time and keeps with my casual work look . well worth the money ! 
pictures doesn ' t do this watch justice . it ' s beautiful . the green numbers , dials , and red second hand are all highly visible against a black background . it ' s a tad bigger than i would like but it still looks good on my wrist . ( i don ' t know my wrist size but for reference , i ' m 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; 135lbs . ) 
i have a special weakness for wenger watch since i already have one and am very happy with it . hence when i came to know about this latest version of leather military watch from wenger , i couldn ' t resist taking a look at it . i am extremely pleased with my new purchase . the brown colored leather strap design is really elegant and feels comfortable on my skin . the mineral crystal ensures better durability and the magnified date display helps in clear viewing . the watch is water resistant and comes with three - year manufacturer ' s limited warranty . i opted for the round shape . the 72900 series guarantees precise and high quality swiss - quartz movement so that you are never late for any appointment . 
i have had this a few months now . good quality band and easy to read . more a casual / business casual watch . the crystal is not scratched yet ( a problem of mine ) so it may be better quality or i haven ' t been as clumsy . somehow the numbers seem a bit bigger in real life than they do in the photos . 
the marketing for this watch indicates & # 34 ; quick charge , high visibility & # 34 ; for the glow on the luminous hands and indices . only the hands glow at a visible strength for more than a few seconds - in fact it lasts several minutes , but the rest of the indices , numerals etc . do not and are only visible even in total darkness for maybe 60 seconds . i recently learned that the only & # 34 ; glowing & # 34 ; type of watches that have strong and long - lasting visible glow are ones that use & # 34 ; tritium tubes & # 34 ; for their glow illumination . the watch itself is nice enough and has a good look , but it ' s not the mil - spec watch wengers ' marketing materials make it out to be . 
this is the second wenger watch that i have owned and i cannot say enough good things about the quality and craftsmanship that goes in to their watches . i had previously owned thewenger swiss military men ' s 72917 classic field black dial brown leather military watchbut i lost it on a trip . needless to say , i wanted another wenger to replace it only this time i opted for the dial white face , instead of black . purely a personal preference . and i am definitely not disappointed . upon receiving the watch , i inspected it for any small little things that may be imperfections in production and i found none . the leather strap is durable , feels good on my wrist , and is quite comfortable . even though it is a larger watch , i hardly notice that i am wearing it . and , aside from that , i rather like the design wenger put into the strap . the crystal is perfect . viewing the dial is very easy . there is no distortion which i have encountered with some other brands , ie sometimes the viewing angle does not allow for a crystal - clear view . not on the wenger . from any angle it is crystal clear . the black outline on the minute and hour hands ( along with the red second hand ) are very visible . the crown , like my earlier one , is a bit stiff but not overly so . i would much rather have it that way than too loose . with some other brands i have discovered that the crown , due to being somewhat loose , had popped out and my timepiece was no longer keeping time . or it came loose , the time changed , and the crown went back , but the time was way off . a tighter fitting crown protects that from occurring . speaking of keeping time , the 72900 is keeping perfectly in synch with my smart phone . it does not seem to miss a minute . this is a sturdy , well - built and accurate timepiece . definitely highly recommended ! ( update sept 18 , 2013 : going on two years now and it is still keeping totally accurate time . i have accidently grazed the crystal on some fairly rough surfaces but there is no permanent damage , it is still clear . the band still looks new , though there is that indentation where the latch and buckle meet the band - but that happens to any leather strap . i remain perfectly happy with this timepiece . ) 
my husband likes watches a lot . he is constantly buying . arrived on time , good quality i will buy again to this seller . we bought 4 watches , but this one has really good price and looks very nice 
i also have now owned 4 or 5 of these and they just get worse as time goes on . first one lasted a couple years and band finally broke and it fell a long ways and it was pretty rough looking . i am oilfield and don ' t take them off much . they lived as i lived . the second one lasted couple of years and quit working and a new battery did not last 2 weeks . the third one died and a new battery for it didn ' t last . this last one has been treated better , no shower , no pool , i am older and working in office now so it doesn ' t see sledge hammers and wrench marks . reading the reviews i find i am not alone here , it appears the quality has dropped over the years . not sure but for what they cost one year is about all you going to get out of them . better with a timex . . . 
my husband has been trying to find a " non - baggy " pair of levi ' s for years or since the baggy style became the trend . he ' s been wearing the 505 but really not happy . i read the reviews on the 514 and purchased the " tumbled black " . 1st pair was a 36 x 30 which was too large around the waist . on - line , amazon issued a return label for the 36 x 30 and i placed a separate order for 34 x 30 which arrived and actually fit ! my husband has legs and a seat again and looks really good ! no longer the " i can see the pants moving but is there someone in - side them look " ? the " tumbled black " is a woven material with white threads through it so it is not a true solid jean ' s black , more a muted black because of the white threads . we will be buying more of the 514 slim straight leg in different colors . he was extremely happy with the fit and so am i ! 
i went one size bigger cause i like to wear it loose . very comfortable . would definitely buy more of this brand . 
i bought this for my husband . he likes them a lot . they fit perfectly on him . love the way they look ! 
the first shipment of this was one that had a defect , which i didnt gind out until after the expiry period gor returns . i vontacted amaxom and immediately they replaced it and the new one came and it fit very well . would definitely recommend . greatnlook and would eexommemd amazon asntjeir cisromer service is amazing . first timw i have ever had a problem with a purchase and am happy i syixk withnamazom over the years 
muy buenos jeans comodos , frescos , resistenten . arman bien en el curpo el tiro y el ancho de bastas estan muy bien . 
having never tried on the 514 ' s before , i have to admit that this just may be the best pair of jeans i own . 
i got 2 pairs . the plain black fit perfectly . my husband loves them . i also ordered the black denim in the same size and they were too small . those went back . 
ordered these as a deal buy . the pictures do not show the distressed look on the front and back and as i ordered them for work , cannot wear these . plus they are too loose for a straight fit . my first purchase with amazon that i will be returning . 
these jeans are very comfortable and soft . i ' m 5 ' 9 and weigh 180lbs and w34 l30 fit me well with a little room . if you don ' t like slim jeans , this jeans might be for you . i got the indigo watch color and it look good with sneakers and boots . great jeans and good price . 
these look great on my husband and i love the deep blue colour . the ever reliable levi . they are the best . 
i have been searching for jeans that are slim enough for a man with straight hips and very little derriere . these are a bit large . the 511 slim style is a better fit . 
got this for my hub . . it is a very nice fit style color very nice love these jeans . . . get it 
i bought this item in two different colors , but in the exact same size . the first pair fits fine . the second pair was too small in the crochal region . the waist is too small , and the distance between the waist and the , uh , you know , that , the distance is too small . so the part of the pants where the two legs begin to separate is high , causing my twig and giggleberries to rest on it . so it ' s either walk around with that all day or it ' s & # 34 ; pick a pant , put your junk in that pant & # 34 ; . i end up looking like the cover of the sticky fingers album by the rolling stones . otherwise , i guess the quality of the material is good , and i ' m satisfied with the pair that actually fits . 
nice jeanit fits me very well . nice season wearing such nice jean . nice weekend nice weather , not nice so many words to type in , not nice amazon such dirty set . 
the colour is exactly as it is described , inky blue . the fit is as expected . once you know your waist and length all you have to do is find the fit that suits you best . 
levis hava always been the best choice for me . i have had more expensive jeans but always return to levis 
with no reviews , i was skeptical . also , i didn ' t know what effect a little polyester might have on the jeans . the answer to the last question is none ; they feel and act exactly like 100 % cotton jeans . i own a lot of levis 514s - - regular and in colors . these by far are the best fitting . i don ' t have the greatest tush ( in fact very little at all ) , yet these fit nicely , not sagging back there where i have very little . highly recommended . 
this jeans is perfect i love the material and the cut of this pants i bought it a size to small so make sure and check the sizing chart before purchasing it was a rookie mistake on my part i was new to buying online 
i could not find any jeans like this in stores , so i was glad to find them on amazon . they fit great , feel comfortable . the rigid grey look awesome . they ' re really great for dressing it up a bit , but can also be worn casually . 
okay , so i ' m female and i ' ve bought some cute feminine levis ( 524s ) and i ' m fond of comfort so i have 501 ' s and 517 bootcuts . these make you look sleek and in control . i love the dark tints in these jeans , the rise is not toolow and not granny high . i ' m glad i took a chance with these , they fit me fine . 
this is so perfect . exactly what i wanted ! came exactly as described and gives me comfort and confidence when i wear it 
good jeans , soft pre - washed makes them feel and look as if i ' ve owned then a while . i generally like my jeans to fit snug and tapered . these fit good up top and around the waist and nicely in the behind . the back of the legs , however , are not as tapered as i like and fit somewhat loose . 501 ` s fit better there but i don ' t care for the button fly on 501 ` s . overall , waist & inseam are accurate . 4 - stars 
ok , rating any pair of jeans is a bit dangerous because what looks best on any one person is largely a function of their build . fyi , i ' m 5 ' 7 " with really short legs ( 30 " or even 29 " inseam ) and i weigh about 180lbs . i usually buy clothes for someone with an " athletic " build , whatever that means . anyway , these are my favorite pair of jeans ever . they ' re comfortable and soft before you even wash them , tight enough that they don ' t look like i bought them in 1999 , but not so tight that i can ' t move in them comfortably , and they definitely aren ' t a " skinny " fit either . like most people , one of my favorite things about these is that in 32 - 30 they just fit me absolutely perfectly the first time i put them on . though since very few people have my particular dimensions , that may not be such a bonus for most of the people reading this . anyway aside from what they cost , levi ' s are my favorite brand of denim ever . now the caveat : some people think this brand is still an american classic , others think its not what it used to be . the one ' s i own are ( by current standards ) quite heavy ( 13 . 5oz per yard ) , and will shrug off abuse that would totally destroy most designer brands ( which is another reason why levi ' s 514 are my favorite jeans ever ) . but not all levi ' s are created equal . first , steer clear of the " levi strauss signature " line carried by a certain discount retailer , these are not built to the same standard as real levi ' s carried elsewhere . second , remember when you ' re shopping for jeans the color matters . i know that sounds odd , but remember , the color of a particular pair of jeans isn ' t just the result of applying a fabric - safe dye in a particular shade . there are usually different amounts of washing and tumbling involved , and even the specific dye formula used could either determine what exact weight of denim the manufacturer uses , or else possibly effect the final state ( and durability ) of the fabric . in short , jeans don ' t really come in different colors , they come in different finishes . levi ' s are especially troublesome in this regard because , as you can see just by looking at the choices offered on this page , they offer a huge range of different colors / finishes , and some of them look the same even though they ' re not . worse still , if you buy them in the store , there may not be any info on the finish ( the last time i did so , i couldn ' t find any on the tag ) . so what to do ? if you ' re shopping in person , pinch the fabric between your thumb and index finger . i ' m no expert , but i could tell that a pair of 12oz jeans were lighter than my 13 . 5oz levi ' s the first time i tried ( as in i thought the 12oz felt thinner , so i looked them up and found out they were 12oz rather than 13 . 5oz ) . second , if you need a finish that will take a beating , when in doubt order the " rigid " finish . it will not be as comfortable to start with ( rigid jeans will feel " stiff " or even " hard " when they ' re new ) , but " rigid " finish typically wears like iron . anyway aside from the finish , you also need to find the waist rise , seat cut , thigh cut , leg opening , and of course waist and leg for you , 514 ' s in 32 - 20 are mine , whether they ' re also yours will depend on your specific build , but levi probably makes a cut for everyone . to me the price is high ( msrp $ 60 ) , so i don ' t always buy these unless i can find a good sale . and no , these aren ' t the first name in designer fashion anymore , but in the first place , i think stuff like button - flap back pockets and " super deconstructed pre - distressed " denim usually looks stupid and would definitely look stupid on me . on top of that , i ' d feel really stupid paying more for one pair of 7 for all mankind jeans than i pay for a 110 thread count wool suit including the tailoring . if that sort of thing makes you happy though , who am i to judge ? just remember the $ 350 pair of diesel jeans your friends are all jealous of now might be as out of place in 15 years as a pair of jnco ' s . this is something else you don ' t have to worry about with a pair of levi ' s . 
i love this jeans first time i do not like but now i love it and every day i were it 
i bought a pair of these last year , wore them for a year , wore them out , and loved ' em . ordered a new pair this spring . two days later , split the seam from crotch to knee when i squatted down to pick something up . a wee bit embarrassing and a lot of hilarity later , i got home . about a month ago , i ordered another pair ; i figured it was just a defect in the first ones , and c ' est la vie . this pair is less than a month old , and split a hole in the crotch . i ' m exactly the same weight i was last year and the year before ; i ' m a pretty thin dude . this is ridiculous , and i ' m not exactly happy with burning money buying ' em . 
neat looking jeans with a length fit that ' s right on . waist is lower than older models but comfortable as long as you keep activities calm and reasonable vigor . . . . . . . . 
i love these jeans . i also tried the 511s but they were too tight at the ankle . the 514s give you a clean look and slim fit without being super - tight skinny jeans . they ' re also very comfortable . 
i ' m 6 ' 1 & # 34 ; about 180 lbs . and i have finally found a slim fit jean stylish enough to wear out with the comfort to lounge around the house . put ' em on in the morning and you are done . 
i like the straight leg fit of these jeans . i ' ve worn many other more expensive jeans but these are just as good . 
i know these jeans are for men but , i took a chance and i am glad i did ! these jeans are mid rise and straight - leg and come in talls so the fit is perfect for me since i am straight up - n - down built . i have a little curve but , not much . i got a size bigger in the waist as i did not want them to fit too snug . these jeans look good on a woman if you are tall with some curve and like to size the length yourself for heels or flats . . . what a great concept being able to pick my own length ! ! ! i like the choice and jeans are not just for dress - down now , in other colors are used for dress - up casual . thanks again , i ordered many ! ! ! 
these have the best combination of fashion , function , fit and comfort of all of the levi ' s brand jeans . they are true to size . they have a moderate rise . . . not too high or low . they are relaxed but not saggy . they have generous leg length for a tad of a slouch at the ankle , but they don ' t drag the ground . keep the 514 style going , levi ' s ! ! ! 
in the picture looks different to what it is , but i gave it 4 stars because it is not bad . as for the purchase and shipping all positive 
what better place to find the sizes you want , but aren ' t always available in stores . i trust amazon . com to have good quality and to get it to me quickly . 
514 ' s are the best fitting jeans for my tall and lean husband . they are a good value and great product 
all too often when you buy jeans that are not really jeans , meaning not denim , the fit is not what you would expect . in the care of these levis ' 514 , the fit is exactly the same . very pleased with the product . the look is up scale and would go nicely with a blazer . 
i am completely surprised how good the quality of this jeans are ! the craftmaship is very good . . . something rare in levis , as you can find some defect on the garment they make . this jeans were made in colombia . the people in charge of inspecting the garment did their job ! the material is soft and the cut / style is pretty good , i have a few 501 and i definitely will buy more of this 514 style . maybe some people that like their jeans rough might not like this one as they feel soft , if you have armani exchange jeans that ' s like the soft they feel . i had the black color , for sure not all the colors are made of the same material . 
i ' m older , tall and thin . these jeans are the best fitting i ' ve found for years . they do not ride high on the waist , but hang nicely and do not interfere with normal movement . i now have 3 pair of these in different colors and they all fit the same . the material is not thick like some jeans but that ' s okay with me . 
levi men ' s 514 slim straight jeans , dirt rush color , 34x34the sizing is spot - on , i normally wear size 34x34 pants and these fit properly . the dirt rush color looks like a bronze / brown / mud color mixed in with dark blue denim . it is not apparent on amazon ' s photographs , but it is not a bad color . the fit is definitely straight , and it actually feels a tad looser but is perfectly fine . the waist is very low - rise . i ' m not usually one for following fashion trends , but magazines for men ' s fashion seem to indicate low - rise jeans are " good to go " . these definitely don ' t look old fashioned , but the pricing is good , and the styling is sharp . the material and construction quality is excellent as well . i have a pair of kenneth cole reaction jeans that are a slim straight cut as well , but are sized tighter . unfortunately , the material is paper thin . i actually burned a small hole in those when i got too close to the exhaust of my ducati motorcycle . i was able to fix that with blue permanent marker , so that tells you how much i liked the styling . these levi 514 jeans are a close match but with an even lower - rise waist . the pockets are great , and i have no serious complaints . overall : 4 / 5 stars , great styling , sizing is good , and the color scheme is contemporaryupdate : 11 jan 2013after wearing two pairs of these jeans for a long period of time , i find that the hems could have been tighter ( at the ankles ) . they are advertised as straight cut , but they could be " straighter " in my opinion . the front pocket openings need to be wider . i can barely fit my hand in there , let alone with a pair of winter gloves . my latest pair has a really lose fitting button that comes undone each time i unzip the fly to use a urinal . 
i have a couple of pairs of 514 slim straight jeans and was surprised when i received this item as the material is definitely not as heavy . the more i wear them the more i like the lighter material and they will be especially nice for summer wear . my only challenge now is trying to figure out how to order another pair of these lighter weight levi ' s . 
i ' ve been wearing the 514 for years , mainly in rigid . ordered my size in the 3d finish fabric tochange things up . the jeans were about 2 inches too small . order up a size or two from your regular if you go with this fabric . 
i purchased these for my husband - they arrived in good shape , well packed and before scheduled delivery . the jeans are a nice color and true levi ' s . they are a bit thin though - these are not 501 ' s or the sturdier jean material thus the price , but they are comfortable ( per my husband ) . i say they fit small because after the first wash they shrunk , a lot . although they still fit , albeit tighter at the waist and across the bum / thigh area , they do not stretch back out to the original unwashed size . 
the pants are good , they feel good , i ordered 34x32 , they do not fit like they supposed to , but that was my fault i guess , cause i was going to order 32x32 wich is my sized in most pants , other than that they look great , i will order other colors 
levi ' s are a sure bet when chosing jeans . the fit was just perfect . gave me a good feeling just watching his delight with these jeans . i would hope to get them on sale in the future as 40 . is more than i ' m comfortable paying for kids jeans but it was a nice gift at least . . perfect ! 
fit as expected . i knew that they would strech a little . i normally wear 38 pants and these fit easily 
i ' ve tested my 514s against dog snot , drool , scrapes , cuts , ink spills , and office chairs . it ' s no worse for wear - it looks and feels better than the day i got them . 
i bought these for my husband and they fit him perfectly . not to tight or not to loose . these jeans look good on tall men . 
good product and the 35 waist is just what i need . the jeans fit very well and they are of very good quality and look great . 
it is very hard to find jeans for a man with a thin waist and long legs . sizes 27 and 28 are almost impossible to find . 
i ordered and received 29w x 30l . i could not pull these all the way up and the couldn ' t close by several inches . since when do we have to remember our different sizes in levi jeans ? 
me encanto este jean como lo pedi y pense . . . . lo recomiendo el corte . , . . y el acabado . . . de venezuela . . . valencia jesus 
i am a person who is very particular about fit . this one gives me the comfort i want . good jeans and good price . 
i bought these for my boyfriend . we ' ve bought the same levi ' s 514 jeans before at department stores for $ 40 + . the cut and fit is the same on this pair but the denim is thinner . he actually prefers the lighter weight denim , especially in warmer weather . but if you want the traditional thickness of levi ' s 514 stick with the department store version . 
these pants are way more comfortable than i ever imagined , they don ' t feel super durable but only time will tell . 
i only have 501s and 514s in jeans and tend to be a levi ' s only guy when it comes to my denim . ( i do have a pair of wranglers with the cordura lowers for field wear . ) it ' s been a little while since i bought my last pair and have only washed these once , but i can ' t help but feel like these have thinner denim . i ' ve tried to do a feel test to the others , but with these being new the & # 34 ; touch & # 34 ; is too different to be certain . they are definitely a lighter weight than both of my 501s . i deducted one - star because i don ' t remember putting on a pair of levi ' s jeans and wondering if they felt light weight . after a couple of washes if i can tell that something isn ' t right , i will update the review , but for now i ' m happy enough . 
eventhough i ' ve read several colors of 514 doesn ' t fit exactly , i ' ve to tell : i ' ve just bought on levi ' s online store a 514 & # 34 ; bastion & # 34 ; and after that bought these 514 & # 34 ; white bull & # 34 ; . they don ' t fit exactly the same but , both fits great . bastion have 2 % spandex and white bull has only 1 % . before i buy 514 bastion i tried on a local store a 514 of another color . great priece , great jeans . just as expected . 
these jeans are faded blue and have little different color than most of my other lighter color jeans . these look more like a faded older pair of jeans than the new faded at the factory jeans . i like the 514 fit too . 
very good . 
ok . . so i had my fill of 150 . 00 plus jeans . they are great , but for that price its ridiculous . i came across these levis 514s and am hooked . they fit like stylish expensive jeans and come in all different styles and colors . i get constant compliments on them and they fit very well for guys that are in shape ( good butt jeans ! ) . anyway . . . . . forget those million dollar jeans , these are great and will last you a long time . 514s rocks ! 
with levi ' s , you usually get what you expect and this was no exception . there were more color options than found in a store . great jeans at a great price . 
these jeans fit well , look great - good as always levi product . he liked them so well , we ordered a 2nd pair . 
yes , my son ' s use the wish list option for christmas and birthdays . these were a christmas present and he loves them . enough of a recommendation as far as i ' m concerned . 
these are my husband ' s favorite jeans . they fit very well and are the color he wanted . i just might have to order more ! 
perfect jeans . the size , the fabric , the design , the color , the price , the general look , the feeling , all are perfect . 
very nice jean , i could not ask more from levi ' s , they fit as expected , i never had any problems with quality and size , so i recommend to all who wants good jean . . . 
noticed these jeans tend to shrink in length after washing a few times . so we buy an inch longer & are happy with them in the long run . 
the 514 is a nice fit , not too tight and not too loose . masculine without being skinny . the problem is the denim . these jeans are damn thin , even more so than levi ' s you can buy in department stores . don ' t try to do any actual blue collar work in them . 
i have also submitted a detailed review of a khaki colored pair i bought of these jeans . as mentioned in other review , you will find these to be very true to size . the cut is wonderful as they follow original designs of levi products with a butt that does not sag , wider legs but a cuff that is regular , not a taper or boot cut design . i like the weight of the material as well . not a thin denim nor a bulky or heavy material either . . . just right ! i own a few different pairs of these in different colors and caution you on this particular color ( inky blue ) as the color will bleed if not washed before wearing . i also recommend you wash separately the first time . i have owned these for a couple months and worn several times and found that the color bleed was very minimal and the separate washing was only done the very first wash cycle . i kept my rating at 5 stars simply because these darker jeans are to be expected to have some color bleed . the great thing about these is that even after a half dozen washes the color is still that same rich dark blue as i expected . shipping was quick through prime and packaging was in a poly bag and sent in a mailer pouch . all around a winner for levi ' s and me ! 
this was my first online purchase of a levi ' s jean , which are pretty expensive in my country . must say i will never buy a jean at a store . this is just what i needed . the color is great . it fits as expected . i ' ll definitely be ordering more . 
yes these pants fit wellhusband has true slim build . . . the length worked also ; we ordered hoping the size description was accurate , and it is . 
i like these jeans a lot . levi gets a lot of flak for the material quality , but these jeans feel solid and look good for the price . it is after all a budget jean . i think the type of material is dependent on the wash you order . i ordered another atypical color from levi and the jean basically feels like it ' s made out of thin cardboard . 
fine jean , it came the size i needed and it ' s very confortably day by day everyday . . i recommended for everyone 
the fit is great at first however they will shrink and fade after a couple of washes so buyer beware 
i received the pants quickly and well packed . the color of the jeans were incredible and a perfect black . on closer inspection though , there weren ' t any of the regular levi labels i was used to on the inside , just some with washing instructions and other mumbo jumbo . i ended up calling the levi verification line and confirmed they were authentic , to my relief . they fit great , wear well , and look like champs . love my 514s . 
i love this jeans i ware them today and they r sooooooo cool . thanks a lot ~ size , color , delivery 10 stars : ) ) 
ladies with kardashian sized behinds or jennifer lopez sized backside , listen up ! this is the boyfriend jeans you ' ve been waiting for . the legs are slim enough but not tight ( so it fits your outlandish man - sized thighs ) but the seat of the pants are large enough to fit arsenio hall ' s famous buttocks . it may even fit the muscular physiques of the williams sisters and a couple of tennis balls in the back pockets . in fact , i put a small phone book in the rear while the waist button was closed and i could still stick my full hands in the back pockets . mind you , everything else fit just fine . the legs are slim but not skinny and the waist , while sitting on the hips . were snug enough to hold the pants up . i guess the foreign pattern makers who work levi ' s jeans these days watch too many american tv shows and think that this is the land of the unfit lard behinds . to top it off , the fabric quality is atrociously bad . i ' m going back to the 501s . 
my teen sons really like these jeans . my only complaint is that the material is much thinner this year so that does affect the warmth factor . they still fit nicely though . 
i picked these for their color ( a dark slate blue ) and hubby loves the fit , which he says is comfy but is also on - trend . 
the jeans were a great value and they fit very well - the colors represented on the website are a bit off however - i suppose the word " sky " is pretty ambiguous after all - they aren ' t blue , or grey or any other color i have seen in retail outlets . i would still recommend them but only if you aren ' t expecting a specific color in mind . also , the material on these jeans are substantially thinner than the same model ( 514 ) you will find in retail outlets - hence the lower price i suppose 
husband ' s been wearing the 559 ' s for additional room in the seat and thighs but so baggy and worse after an hour of wearing them . . not the case with these 514 ' s - they ' ve held up thru many washes and look great on him without the stretching out / bagging seat . and he likes they ' re comfort so i don ' t have to hide his other jeans to get him to wear them ! ! hope levi continues this style as they ' re his new favorite . 
my husband loves the fit of these jeans being a size 32 - 36 we have a difficult time finding this size in stores lucky to of found them on amazon . he said the material isn ' t heavy so they will work during the summer when he has to wear jeans . levis are the jeans my family wears great fit and style , at a great price , free shipping and they get shipped fast . within a week of ordering . 
i got these jeans for my son , he is 12 y . o . , 5 ' 6 , 118lb , size 28 / 32 fits perfect around the waist and the leght as well . jeans very light and comfortable , not like heavy cloth i meant . i wish more colors were available in his size , but it all sold out , but he is good for now . 
what i like the most of this jean is the color , its really nice and elegant adjust to any ocasi & oacute ; n and fits well . 
these pants fit me great , the size was perfect , i really love them and the quality seems great , i got them because i saw them in the store first to make sure they fit 
how can levis give four completely different pants the same model number ? it is a joke of the first order . how are you supposed to ever find the jeans you like when you can * never * count on getting them twice in a row using the same model number ? who is the genius who decided that ' 514 ' should be applied to all manner of totally different pants ? who decided they should be made in disparate countries from production run to run ? i will never patronize levis again - number one they are made in bangladesh or columbia , number two they are literally morons at levis , and morons don ' t deserve our business . 
i have a couple of slim jeans , but unfortunately i will not classify this as slim . i am 1 . 78m and 70kg . the w32l32 fits well on the waist and the length is also perfect . the colour of the jeans ( overhaul ) does seem to be slightly different from the pictures , but not a big deal . i like the subtle fade without being too " loud " . unfortunately , the fit of the jeans is not really that slim for a slim guy like me . crotch area is pretty tight but from the thigh area all the way down to the calf area , the jeans is pretty much " normal straight " to me , much like regular 501s . the ends of the jeans also seem to flare out instead of crumpling neatly into a pile , making the jeans look somewhat " bootcut " . if you are a person with thicker legs who wants to try going " slim " , this is probably a good cutting to try out , i guess . however if you are a really slim guy looking for a pair of slim jeans which fits closely to your legs , you may feel slightly disappointed . try the 511s instead . 
i have other levis 514 , they are amazing , so slim and the jeans fits well , very soft ! the price are the best , there are jeans much more expensive that don ' t fit like levis ! ! ! ! ! 
these pants fits perfect in my husbands body . they are perfect for his big butt . they are hard to get , i don ` t understand , maybe a lot of people buys them . 
i ' ve bought dozens of jeans for my husband and they are all too baggy . all the jeans today are just big all over . he is a small frame guy and needs a slender fit especially through the legs and rear . he always wore levi ' s in the 70 ' s and they fit like a glove but now you just can ' t find that fit anywhere . these are as close to that as you will find . not quite as slim fitting as the ones you wore in the 70 ' s but pretty close . they don ' t look like he is swimming in them and they are not so peg legged his feet look like boats . he really likes them and will be ordering more . we bought the overhaul color and they washed great didn ' t fade at all or shrink . if you are a guy with skinny legs and no butt these will look great on you ! 
these jeans fit great ! they feel great and look good as well . i ' ve looked for jeans that aren ' t too baggy for a while now & was so excited to find these . my buddy bought a pair at a dept . store and these do have a different feel to them , but i think these are great , for a great price ! i haven ' t washed them yet , so we ' ll see how they feel after they get washed ! ? ! 
it is nearly impossible to find 35 & # 34 ; waist jeans in the stores . amazon has 35 / 32 , and it fits ! the inky blue color is good , too 
these jeans feel like they ' re made from paper . also , because i thought they would shrink if i washed them in my washing machine , i used dryel . but they still shrank ! 
i have had quite a history with wearing jeans - there was a phase when i could pass off as a bum , and then another phase when i could pass as a bloated stick figure - and sadly each of those phases ( and others in between ) have been immortalized in my family photographs . when i opened the box for these and put them on , however , it was like i had finally met my soulmate . the 514 has been variously labeled as a straight fit or a slim straight fit . i believe this should be correctly labeled as a slim straight fit . however it is nowhere close to being skinny . in my opinion these are best suited for my body type ( i am 180cm and 178lbs - with relatively slimmer legs ) . they hug the thighs just so correctly and do not feel baggy . they look equally great with moccasins and sneakers - though hang a little loose at the end with my dress shoes . i haven ' t had a chance to wear them with boots - but i think they would do okay with boots as well ( i do not like bootcuts ) . the dirt rush color is very neutral - a little bit lighter than it appears in the photograph ( not necessarily a bad thing ) - and looks more greenish in sunlight - however very subdued . overall , a great purchase - and i will definitely buy more colors in the same 514 style . 
i purchased these for my husband after reading about this particular style of levi ' s . he is a big guy but really doesn ' t have a rear . these fit slightly slimmer in the hip , so really look good on him . he is 6 ' 1 & # 34 ; , 205 and wears a 36 / 34 and these are perfect ! 
older men , pay close attention : these are low cut - - meaning they do not ride high like average jeans . i didn ' t see that caveat and now wear low - cut jeans . ( i ' m 43 and these jeans make me self - conscious about looking like i ' m trying to look 23 , which i ' m not ) . other than that , they look fine . 
thanks levis strauss for coming up with this slim look ! i had a pair of another brand in the slim look and was very happy with them until i spilled some sticky substance that would not come out . . . . threw them away . had a tough time finding something similar to them . levis came to the rescue . . . they look better on me than the other name brand . i ' m buying all levis slim look jeans . amazon this is a great price . . . wish you had a lay a way plan . 
real levis , compared the stitching and the materials with 514s i already owned . color is true to the images in the pictures . 
i don ' t like so tight . i ' m really 34 but the 36 it ' s a litle wide , but it is comfortable . i love levis jeans . 
the style and fit are fine except they seen very long for a 30 length . hoping they will shrink when washed . 
fit is exactly as described , not too loose or too tight . always wore 505 or 501 ' s but these seem to have a better fit to them . 
a little baggier that i had hoped , but still an overall good fit . next time ill go with a 32 32 
i have been wearing levi ' s forever and these 514 ' s are the perfect fit . if you wear boots these are the perfect jeans for boots , not to tight not to lose , just perfect . great price from amazon , thanks ! 
i love the jeans . they are comfortable , high quality , and good looking . i personally thought they were a bit expensive for what they were worth , but the price changes for amazon items all the time , so it really depends . ( also , i ' m not a huge clothing shopper , so i don ' t know what the " usual " price ) . the jeans arrived like you would find them in a store , with the measurements in a clear plastic sticker along the side of the pants , and the brown tag on the back . i don ' t think these jeans are " incredibly amazing " or " fantastic " but i do think they will last a long time , and look great . 
my husband likes these - loose , comfortable and modern . not & # 34 ; metro & # 34 ; and definitely not baggy . amazon had the best price i ' ve been able to find . 
i recently received a pair of levi 514s for christmas from a from a friend and i found the fit to be absolutely horrible . as a preface , i ' ve been wearing levis jeans pretty much exclusively for over five years . i own several pairs of 501s 514s 529 and 539 . until now i was 100 % satisfied with the product which i was getting however levis was sneaky and changed the cut and sizing of this 514 . i have always worn 32 waist on all of my levis with room to spare . i put on these new 514s and they were practically painted on , much to my suprise . the cut is not a straight cut as you would expect but is a rather fitted tapered cut which is tapered in at the thigh and knee area . if you plan on buying these you better expect that the sizing will not be as you expected . i get adding new styles to the lineup of jeans but do that , add new styles , don ' t destroy the great styles that made people want to buy levis in the first place . so now i am stuck because i don ' t know what levis i ll be able to get a propper fit with . i may have to move on to something else entirely and cherish my now vintage levis that i already have . i am so dissapointed with the lack of consistency with the levis product line now . beware . 
as a tall fit person , it is very hard for me to find jeans that shows my form without being too tight and uncomfortable . i have worn levi ' s 511 skinny jeans my entire life and my experience has been great . however now that i am older , my taste for skinny jeans has gone away and i decided to look at other models from levi ' s for a more comfortable slim fit . since it is hard to judge online , i went to my local sears to try on different designs to see how the fit and comfort were . after trying many different ones , i came across this product the 514 ' s . the fit is quiet amazing , the waist and thigh area has a slim fit but as you go down , the pants become much more loose , giving you more comfort and leg room . the designers did a great job creating jeans that are very comfortable but also has a great slim fit appearance . now , nothing is perfect . even though the appearance and fit is great , the durability is very poor . i wear jeans almost everyday and over a month i have worn these pants probably about 6 or 7 times casually . i did not put these jeans under any rough usage , however the pants started to tear and opened up around the groin area . at first i thought it was a defective pair , so i went and exchanged for another . however i experienced the same situation with the new pair and decided to just move on . i do believe these are great pair of jeans for someone who is just looking for jeans for the weekend , however if you are someone looking for an everyday pair of jeans , i would advise you skip this one . 
i ordered these in inky blue a really great color . the slimmer fit with a straight leg fits much better without all the excess material in the rear area as compared to the 505 i normally wear . keep in mind , however , the slimmer fit also is a bit more snug in the crotch area . 
i love my levis anytime i need jeans i always grab a pair of these . they last long i can wash them a million times and they ' re super comfortable . i should have ordered them one size smaller though since i ' m loosing weight and all they are a tad too big lol but i guess it was a smart decision just in case i gain a few . even though i chose the 5 - 8 business day shipping meathod they arrived in 3 days , probably because i ordered them before 6pm and it was a monday . anyways i ' m a big fan of levis and i ' m in the process of updating my wardrobe and these jeans will be the only pants in my closet because nothing else compares . 
these are the levis to get if you find 505s to be a little too baggy around the waist and seat . the 514s fit more snugly and trim in those areas but otherwise the same in sizing as 505s . there are three minor issues to be aware of . first , many of the 514 colors have the fake & # 34 ; wear & # 34 ; areas instead of uniform color gradations . second , the pockets are markedly tighter than on 505s and tougher to get your hands into . third , the fabric seems to be a little thinner than 505s ( which is not a bad thing for traveling , but also probably not as tough ) . none of those are a big problem , just something to know . overall i ' m very happy with them and they fit much nicer than the 505s ( if you want slimmer fit ) . after trying 1 pair , i ordered several more . 
i cannot remembered owning a pair of black jeans before and that ' s why i gave these a shot . * the fitting was just fine ( 30x32 ) , though a 29x32 would have been perfect . thought they ' d shrink considerably . not . * super comfortable and light weight . * decent price , but a bit too much due to ' con ' below : con : * true black color is gone on first wash . yes , i know to how to do laundry ; darks with darks , whites with whites and all the fancy cycles . so , it not my fault = ) i would , and will not , buy this color again , but most certainly the brand for the price = ) 
great quality cotton . not too thick as these make a great pair of summer cotton jeans . good fit . good length . 
i bought this for my son and he liked it a lot ! the color is exactly like the picture and the fit is perfect ! 
the fit is amazing , the elastic lets it be a bit tighter than i normally wear and not feel strangled when i sit down . i ' m 6 ' 0 & # 34 ; and 180 lbs and the 32x32 were true to size and fit perfectly . 
wasnt sure this woudl fit but finish is pefect and sizing is just spot on . however , 514 twill runs smaller . 
i recently bought a pair of these . they are really comfortable and the fit is great . the fabric is light , but that makes it feel all the more comfortable . i did buy these during the summer , so the light fabric is great for now . it might be different in the winter . you do need to be on the skinny side to wear these . i was afraid that the 514s were going to be discontinued , so i bought a second pair . 
they fit suprisingly well , and their not even broken in yet ! i couldnt be happier . i love the color . great buy . 
. . . this is only after i tried these out at my local department store . it seems levi ' s have shrunk their size by one or two waist size . i usually buy a size 31 , but for these these jeans even 32 was slightly on the tight side . i bought a size 33 expecting it to shrink just a little bit . the color is nice . 
the fit is pretty good , maybe a little bit smaller in the waist than expected but still fits pretty well . hopefully they don ' t shrink too much in the wash otherwise it will become too tight . i ordered the vip color which looks a lot lighter in the picture than it is received . this will probably be solved as i wash it but i don ' t usually buy clothing with the expectation it will change on me over time and washing , as i believe most people do . all in all i am satisfied and i may order more 514s in the future as long as the size holds up in future washings . 
finally , i got a pair from levi ' s where the inseam was correct . this is a review i just wrote for lee : i am going to buy more lee now than levi ' s . i had never bought lees until this holiday season . i now have several pairs and they are consistent ( so far ) in length and quality . i am 6 ft 3 and usually buy 34 x 34 . with levi ' s sometimes the inseam is slightly too short and other times it is almost 2 inches too long . i have many pairs of levi ' s now that i must get hemmed . plus their quality varies - maybe depending on where they are made . some pairs seem more like spandex than denim . nevertheless , sometimes i like the colors that levi ' s offer so in the future i may buy them again . but mostly now lees . 
i am an athletic guy and these jeans are the first to fit me well . the quality is great and they are a great value for the money . the shiny coating is really cool . 
the label on the pair of jeans i received said 36x32 ( waist 36 & # 34 ; , leg 32 & # 34 ; ) , but when i wore it , it had plenty of room to spare on my waist ! i was delighted , thinking that my diet had been successful . i then made a measurement the waist of the jeans to confirm , and the measurement read 38 & # 34 ; . no thanks for cheating my feelings and giving me the wrong sizes on my pair of jeans , levis . 
the fit was just off for my body type . it fit ok at the waist , but way overly baggy in the seat and thigh . 
i like the fit of these . i have muscular legs and a narrow waist , and i can actually get the legs of these over my thighs and calves without a struggle unlike the 505 ' s . but they are badly mislabeled . i ordered a 31 inch waist / 30 inch inseam . the product i received was labeled as such . the actual inseam measured with a tape measure was almost 32 inches , way too long for me to wear . i don ' t understand how such a basic failure in quality control can be allowed to happen . 
the 514 is my favorite levi ' s cut and price can ' t be beat ! these are very decent jeans for the price . i ' ve spend hundreds of dollars on expensive jeans such as diesel , but for the money , i still wear levi ' s as well and have to say i look just as good . i ' m slender and they fit me quite well and don ' t look super skinny or anything , they just look like they fit me very well . i have about 3 different pairs of these however i feel they have too many washes to choose from . some of the lighter washes are a bit similar so it can be confusing to choose , especially when ordering online . if they had about 5 washes total , i believe that would be enough . my favorite ones are the tumbled rigid , which are very dark and almost ' raw ' like they just came out of the factory or something . i also like the indigo wash which is like a good old pair of jeans that you have had for years . some of the other washes with fancy names are too light for my liking , or they just don ' t look that good to me . 
love the color of the rigid grey , classier than blue jeans . material is not a thick denim , these are thinner , but that makes them look dressier . these are a classic , slim fit , which is exactly what we wanted . simple clean lines . 
this is an update , one wash , count that . . one wash and they shrunk 1 " in length . i have the same exact jeans in the inky blue from costco and washed both for the first time together . the inky blue did not shrink but this kale , did shrink and one inch makes the difference between fitting perfectly and being almost " high water " . i frankly was shocked to have them shrink let alone shrink an inch . i know it may be quibbling but you expect more from levi and face it you pay more for levi . disappointed ! and yes , cold water wash and rinse , no hot water whatsoever was involved . grrr ! the jeans fit exactly how i expected . i had purchased what i thought was the same pair of jeans at costco for ten dollars more than the price i got here at amazon . i tried to get all the correct numbers off of the label and order the exact same thing here at amazon . levi has a very difficult to decipher part number . they also have a wide range of colors . if i am buying a new pair of jeans , i prefer them looking like new jeans , i will add the wear as i wear them . the one i got from amazon are the same color every where but on the thighs which have that slightly faded look . since they fit so well i kept them but i was disappointed that they were not exactly what i wanted . however at the price i couldn ' t turn them down . 
este pantalon es muy suave , se ve de buena calidad , es comodo , el color es chevere ademas el precio es acorde y adsequible . 
it ' s so cozy ! it ' s slim and thin and i won ' t feel hot even in summer . but the surface feels kind of rough . 
everyone should own a pair of rad solid black jeans . these fit perfectly ! a litttttle bit looser than the 511 ' s after washing them a few times . and these are a little spandex too like 1 percent . so they stretch a minor amount to open and give a little breathing room . great jeans . 
it serves it purpose , but almost immediately , the foam in the cups & # 34 ; rippled , & # 34 ; i guess is a good way to describe it . it ' s a cheap product , so don ' t expect too high of performance out of it . i think it ' s possible to have an inexpensive foam that is higher quality for the cups . 
i am a 34d and this bra fits perfectly . the straps don ' t cut into my shoulders after wearing it for a while . also bought the taupe , it ' s perfect for wearing white t - shirts or clothes where you might be able to see through the material if the bra is too dark / bright . the taupe color blends in well with my skin . 
bra is comfy but not pretty at all . i also think the cups are slightly large and seem to crease , strange because none of my other bras have this issue . it ' s comfy for work . 
34b and this bra is perfect . gives a slight lift , isn ' t tight around the ribs and gives beasts a natural lifted shape . a + + 
i bought this bra as a convertible bra to wear with a backless shirt , however it should be noted up front that the straps only detach in the front , and not the back . i normally wear my backless shirt with a convertible bra and one strap looped around the back of my neck , but because the back straps are stitched and cannot be removed , i can ' t wear it as intended . that said , the bra is really comfy , and i do plan on keeping it around as an everyday bra . 
just want i needed , i hate going to the store and shopping for hours for bras . this brand fits well and is comfy . 
this bra fits nicely and without any weird shapes or gaps in the cup . it ' s soft , simple , and functional , which is what i was wanting . the straps are comfortable and don ' t dig into my shoulders and the band doesn ' t roll like a lot of the ones with only two hooks do . 
most comfortable bra i have ever worn . this bra gives support but you can hardly feel it . i really like the look , the comfort and the fit . the girls are happy , not running free , but comfy & cozy without feeling punished . 
my usual 34b fits in this bra . can wear it all day long while working and forget that it ' s there . ( not literally , not as good as braless for me ) . i ' ve had it over a year now and it ' s still holding up . the only con would be that the foam padding has become slightly dimpled after washing and yes i throw it in the washing machine and hang dry it . i ' ve occasionlly forgot it in the dryer . the dimpling doesn ' t show through your shirt though so no big deal . soft material , gentle straps that don ' t dig in . overall i would purchase again . 
the small clamps on the front ( right above the cup ) that allows you to unhook the cup has rough spots on it . it rubs my skin too much and actually left little scratches / thin scabs from wearing two days in a row . had a nice fit and didn ' t really notice the rubbing too much during the day , but definitely not going to wear it again after noticing the marks left behind . what a bummer . 
i only buy barely there bras . they are very flattering if you have smaller girls . these bras are so comfy and work great with just about any shirt ! 
i have a hard time with bras as i live in a pocket of unfortunate women whose breasts are not proportionate to their body and thus my small breasts have a hard time finding a bra that is both large banded and small cupped . this one works good and is a good type , even if not perfect . 
i ' ve been an image stylist for 10 years . this is my favorite comfy bra to recommend to my clients . it lasts and lasts . i don ' t believe in buying tight bras anymore . they just need to stay in place , so just buy one size up from tight and make sure your cup size is big enough . for more reviews , you can head to my website astore to see more comments there ! i don ' t wear a bra unless i ' m going out in public . free the girls . this is a great bra without too much padding for when you really need to wear one ! ( i ' m wearing a 36 d instead of my usual 34 c ~ i ' ve gained a little weight but it ' s better not to have it fit too tightly ! ) aurethasoul stylist 
love this bra . super inexpensive , fits great and is insanely comfortable ! ! was kind of nervous to buy but it ' s a quality product and i ' m very happy with it ! 
i ' ve been wearing these ridiculous victoria ' s secret bras that were way too padded ( all their bras are ) and am so happy to have found this one . it ' s comfy , cheap , looks smooth , and has a thin lining that smooths out the form and hides nipples without looking bulky or magnifying the breasts - which don ' t need it . all hail this bra : ) 
i ' ve been wearing this brand and style bra for many years and amazon had a good price so i purchased it . 
can see why these bras have so many good reviews . fit great ! ! look great ! ! ! wash great ! ! ! the number one best thing is they are so comfortable . highly recommend these bras . 
really like this bra . very comfortable and great fit . would buy this type of bra again . have even fallen a sleep in it with no issues . 
i am trying this brand for the first time and it is really comfy but at the same time i fell it is somewhat small . i ordered my size but it ' s just a little snug so i gave it away 
i don ' t normally wear padded bars , but this bra is a great exception . i ' m only a 34b so i love the way it sort of rounds out and slightly enlarges my breasts . very comfortable and the material is silky - soft ! a great bra for an even greater price . 
i bought these in 3 colours . they fit as expected and give a great lift which is what i was looking for yet subtle and comfortable . 
this bra totally fit as described & is comfortable . i got them for work since i work 5 days a week @ a hospital & i have to have lots of work stuff so i ' m not consistently washing clothes every week 
i am one person , who always buys the wrong bra ! this time , i took a chance , as i have lost weight so i am 34d , instead of 36d . i bought this bra , and i am in love . this is the best bra ever . very comfortable , love everything about it . for the price , i would even pay $ 40 + for this type ! a must buy ! 
i have a problem with underwires stabbing me under the arm . not with the bra . super comfortable . highly recommend it . 
since i bought this for my wife , i can ' t give you a first hand account of how it fits , but she says it fits good , and i think her boobs look really great in it . 
this was bulky , bumpy , shaped weird . it just did not work . i do not recommend this product . returning right away ! 
i had purchased these same bras at a local department store but after a few years they needed to be replaced . i checked here on amazon and they had them for 1 / 2 the price but pay no tax and no shipping ! i love these bras , they are comfortable , fit true to size , the quality of my last 4 were great and lasted a loooong time ( i wash them with my clothes in the washing machine then hang them to dry ) and best of all you can change the position of the straps for different style tops ! as long as they don ' t change anything about them i will definitely buy them again ! 
bought this bra as a gift and have gotten nothing but positive feedback about it . she loves the softness of the cups and says it ' s very comfortable - - she generally wears a 36b and it ' s true to fit . while she typically finds underwire bras rather uncomfortable , she says that this bra ' s underwire is so soft and flexible she barely even notices it ' s there . we bought the soft taupe color and it was just as expected - - a perfect color to wear under those light colored shirts . 
it took seven tries and i made it finally . i love it . was worth all the ordering and returning . highly recommend . 
i had no problems at all with shipping . the item is very soft and forms around my sides nicely . the straps are a bit smaller , but then again im only an a cup . it also has two clasps on the back instead of three . i ordered the color pink , and it goes well with alot of my clothes . for the price , i wold definetly recomend this item . 
i ' m always looking for comfortable bras and took a chance on this one . i ' m so glad . it is incredibly comfortable while still giving great support . all day i could actually feel the softness next to my skin and it felt light . would like to get about three more and retire some of my old & # 34 ; cages & # 34 ; . its a winner in my book . 
this is a great bra for the price ! fits well and looks good under clothes . the color works with anything you might wear . 
this bra is sooo soft and seems like it would be very comfortable however it runs very small . i am normally a size 38d but this is so tight that i cannot even strap it on and when i finally forced it on it pressed my breasts nearly flat ! i would suggest ordering larger than usual , i didnt bother returning it because i didnt feel like paying return shipping 
i have owned three of these bras ; just bought one in black again recently . my advice on this one is if you are full in the cup , as in a full b , order a c cup . the band size is fine . just beware of the small - ish cups . otherwise , nice bra : 5 stars for comfort . the shaping is ok , but not as flattering as other bras in this category ( underwired , stretch foam , molded / contour cup ) . it kind of spreads them out rather than lifts them , but great for an everyday bra and if you want a natural look . 
great basic bra . a must for everyday , all around wear . very soft fabric , wears well . looks nice under t - shirts . great fit . 
i never seem to get the right size ! 
this is my most favorite bra ! very comfortable and easy to adjust straps . i have several , both black and beige . 
i usually don ' t but clothing or undergarments online but i did this time . i am glad i did . this bra is very comfortable . i would buy again . 
i ' m almost always a 36c . this one is small in the band size and just a tad small in the cup , but a smooth fit and pretty comfortable . i would go up on the band size next time . 
best bra i ' ve ever bought to wear to work ! most comfortable bra ever ! truly soft fabric , doesnt show through when you are cold . so soft and well made . best bra ever ! totally satisfied ! 
the construction is decent for the price , except for the plastic snaps where the strap meets the cup ( which seems a common denominator on most basic bras ) . cup and band size seem true to my measurements ( 34d ) . . . i would buy another one . 
this has been a favorite style of bra and a staple in my wardrobe for many years . good purchase price . 
i would not say that this bra is totally seamless in the front , but it is totally comfortable . the back part of the bra eliminates unsightly back bulge , which is a huge plus . it ' s definitely worth the price . 
my favorite bra out there - it ' s soft , comfortable , and shows smooth through thin blouses . i machine wash and dry these bras , and on average they last me about 18 + months - pretty darn good in my book . 
i tried this for 2 days . i found by the second day i wouldn ' t be able to deal . there are plastic hinges of sorts keeping the front strap attached to cups and i found that they squeak whenever i move . the plastic ring in the back is slightly irritating as well . 
don ' t waste your money . terrible fit and low quality . i have to ask & # 34 ; did a man design this bra ? & # 34 ; lol 
one of the most comfortable and well - fitting bras that i ' ve ever worn . if you ' re looking for nice comfortable bra with good support at a reasonable price then your really need to check this one out . i ' m going to order a few more , myself and throw out all of my old uncomfortable bras . 
i have a bigger size and deceided to give this one a try . i ended up sending it back because it didn ' t fit right for me . i did not like the padding , nor the strapslides in the front . it was not as sturdy as i hoped t would be . 
these bras are so comfy . i love the fit and feel . plan to order more . they look nice under clothes too . 
i have put off buying molded bras because they were too thick and did not look right . this bra is perfect . support plus great look under tee ' s . washes up great . 
boo - i was excited to try this bra too . it arrived and what was supposed to be a 36d was more like a 34b . it was pretty though and i loved the style . i don ' t think it was me , this is the first time i ' ve had a 36d of any brand be too small . i didn ' t see any reviews that said it ran small though , so who knows . . . fluke maybe ? 
the material is soft and the bra it self is lovely . anyone buying this should get a size larger . needed to get a 38 - d . 
the bra is not & # 34 ; too large & # 34 ; as to the fit , but it is flimsy and not very comfortable . i hoped it would have some padding it but it does not . for me , not one that i will be purchasing again . thanks . 
after spending hundreds of dollars on victoria secret bras and having to throw them out after a month i decided to give this a try . i just didnt know where to go anymore for comfortable , fitting bras . i bought this before i went to linda the bra lady for a fitting and of course found out that i was wearing the wrong bra size so i was a little scared about getting this before going to her but as it turned out the bra fits perfectly even though is not the size i was told i actually was . to my surprise this was a perfect and it is so comfortable i may just get more . 
it is my favorite bra . more than ten years using this brand and this style and i have never been disappointed . i loved it ! 
i ' m a pretty standard 34c , but the band was a bit too tight on the widest set of closures . i ' m going to order a size up and see , but the fabric and workmanship are great for such an inexpensive bra ! 
it ' s comfy and nice but i feel like it does not do justice to all my boobs . i ' m currently wearing it now and it is not uncomfortable but i would have liked a little more coverage . overall , it is a good buy 
just got this bra . love it ! so soft and comfy . much more comfortable than my victoria ' s secret bras that are at least 3x the price ! 
i love this bra . it ' s comfy and cute and soft and invisible under clothes ! great value for the price . i ' ll buy again . 
wow ! this bra is so comfortable ! i love how i can adjust the straps from the front and don ' t have to swing it around to adjust from the rear . its much more comfortable than the $ 40 bras i have from victoria ' s secret . i ' d definitely buy more ! 
this was my second order of this bra . the bras are the most comfortable ones i have . that ' s the reason for the second order . 
love this bra . i am back to buy my 3rd one so i have plenty . price is great . . . and i am nursing so i found these to work great and are much better than typical nursing bras and much more comfy . 
i returned this bra because it was smaller than expected around the band . and i will say the quality wasn ' t really all that great 
the product arrived right on time and in a perfectly sized box . i really like the design , color ( beige ) & how incredibly good it feels . definitely recommend the vendor & product ! 
i really like this bra . it fits pretty true to size ( maybe a little small ) . i hate underwire and this gives the same look without the actual wire - which is much more comfortable . 
this is a comfortable , easy to wear bra . only problem is the microfiber catches / snags on even the slightest dry skin on your fingers . 
i order these for my wife , but they came to my house with a defect . one of the straps was sewed incorrectly and it was swirled making it uncomfortable to wear and noticeable through the clothes . i live in colombia , so returning the product was more expensive then the bra itself , so amazon gave me my money back and that was it . they did fit right if it wasn ' t for the defect , so i guess i would have given it a 5 . it happens . . . 
i purchased my first barely there bra on sale at kohls so knew what size to purchase . i am very satisfied with this item . it is so comfortable ! 
these bras ft perfectly . they are my favorite bra ever . i keep buying more and more of them in different colors because they are so great . 
but quality and texture is excellent 
i initially wrote a review where i stated that this bra ran a little small , but actually it doesn ' t . i guess i thought i wore a 36c but actually i wear a 38c and had ordered the wrong size ( after looking at my other bra labels which were 38c ) . i plan on keeping these bras as i ' m , in the process of losing weight anyway , so they will fit even better then . but , this bra feels just marvelous and soft . i will be wearing these under sun dresses that i plan to wear while in europe this summer , and i don ' t want to have to worry about straps falling or the underwires binding my ribcage . 5 stars from me ! 
okay , most bras don ' t fit as advertised but this one is great ! i will be ordering like 3 more and highly recommend it ! 
i found this bra to run on the small side , around . cut size is adequate . i gave it 4 stars because for the money it is a decent bra though i am not expecting it to hold up . 
this bra will fit like a charm . the bra fits comfortably as if you are not wearing a bra at all . the fabric in the bra reminds me of the coobie strappy v - neck lace trim bras . you should no trouble with this bra and you may never need another one . 
i am an average 36 d and this bra was so tight i couldn ' t breathe . the cups look nice , soft and smooth , but they run too small and my girls were spilling on all sides . 
i have been searching for a comfortable tshirt bra for awhile ( including some very expensive bras that i hated ) and saw this mentioned in some magazine as one of the best . so glad i got it . hasn ' t bunched up in the wash either ! 
this bra is comfortable and beautiful and fits well and is the best bra i ' ve ever had . i ordered a couple more in other colors but for some reason the red seems the most comfortable . only negatives : the picture looks like a dark pink but it ' s actually a definite red color . not that it ' s bad at all , i was just expecting pinkish . also , when i adjust the straps to be shorter , they readjust themselves back to be longer again after a couple of days . and there is slight pilling in a couple of spots after wearing sweaters . but still these are a + amazing bras ! and the padding is just enough where they ' re not so " nipply " at the office . 
have found that the barely there line of intimates does perform as advertised . this bra serves me well under knits and almost every blouse and sweater i own . 
i love this bra , gives the girls a nice shape , and is a very comfortable bra to wear , definitely recommend . 
i liked it so much i had to create a stash of them in my closet . feels like your own skin except it realy naturally and comfortably lifts your breast . 
good quality , fits well , comfortable , with a great price . the adjustment tabs have a tendency to slide down a little . 
this bra was very soft and seemed like it would have been extremely comfortable . the biggest issue i had was that i didn ' t fill out the cup , so there was puckering and and fold - age . good product , wrong chest . 
i was surprised that this set fit me so well , as it is a one - size - fits - all . i don ' t really like the placement of the care / material tags on each piece , but with a steady hand , you can cut them off without ruining the fishnet . the fishnet isn ' t of the highest quality , it does snag easily , but for the price this set is well worth that little downside . 
well ill tell you what happen , i work in afghanistan and came home for r & r after 3 months . my wife is always surprising me one way or another when picking me up at the airport . this time i walked out to the parking lot and she was standing waiting for me wearing a knee high jacket . my first though was & # 34 ; god i miss her & # 34 ; second though was & # 34 ; aww i guess she didnt do anything special for me this time & # 34 ; that was untill i got about 10 feet from her and she opened up the jacket and was wearing this ! ! now when i tell you i got excited to see her thats just an under statement ! i was speechless ! ! i love my wife and i hope she never stops doing these crazy things for me ! ! ! 
looks as good as in the picture . i got the one on red and it ' s absolutely gorgeous . great price too . i can ' t wait til my husband sees me in it . he ' s gonna love it too . ; ) 
for one size , it does not really fit on someone like me though i fall in the category well . the thigh highs are too tight on top , and the top comes down too low , so the garters are too long . this would be good on a woman who is 5 ' 10 & # 34 ; & up weighing 125 lbs . waste of my money ! : - ( 
fun and daring three piece ! looking for something a bit unique ? this is it ! it fits and looks great on . 
this product was wonderful and worked well with my curves . the fishnet stockings were two different sizes , but you can play with it to make it look no different . honestly , after you partner sees that the open bust chances are they will not be worried about your legs . lol . my husband thought it looked amazing and he is a very honest person ! i give this a 4 because of the fact that the stockings were not the same length . i analyzed the picture of the models and it seems to me that the models may have the same issue . it is well worth the price ! ! go for it ! 
first off , the fabric is extremely delicate . imagine putting extremely delicate hose all over your body . there is no substance to it . the fabric puckers when you pull on it to put it on . you have to be so careful not to tear it . it catches in everything . it is not really scalloped in the center above the tummy the way the photo suggests . the bottom is completely straight when worn . it is so large . i wear a 6 - 7 and i ' m 5 ' 6 " . it ' s like wearing a garter dress . it comes halfway down my bottom and looks very awkward . you can ' t adjust the garters on it . i can ' t create the scallop above the tummy by tightening the garters . it just looks frumpy . the actual garter clips come almost down to my knees . the stockings are made of the same material . the band at the top gives my thighs that gross " muffin thigh " look . i don ' t have very large thighs , either . i think this outfit would be good for someone who is quite tall and a size 6 or a little larger . a slightly shorter plus size woman ( size 14 ) might also pull this off . the fabric is super stretchy , and i think that some of the length would be compensated for by the larger waist line . if you are thin and petite , don ' t waste your time . the concept is very sexy , however , the one size fits all aspect makes it difficult to know if it will actually fit . 
nice fun set for . . . . having fun . the items came well packaged and the wife was thrilled to try something different . so far the fishnet has held up well to washings and & # 34 ; wear & # 34 ; . 
this was a good buy at a very cheap price . my wife looks incredibly sexy in this , although it wasn ' t on very long . . . instant wood ! 
it was so easy to get on and off and it looked amazing ! ! ! i am short about 5 ' 0 and chubby and this was flattering . my husband was surprised i wore it with black heels and he just loved it so much . i am happy it was a great buy . do not hesitate because it is so worth the price ! 
ordered for my wife . she loved it . great quality and looks perfect on her . arrived early . will order from this seller again . 
this product is well made but one size do not fit most . it would to big for someone small not bad on an average person and not pretty on someone large . then wash it , see who all could fit in it now , i mean how many of us at once . waste of money . 
the body stocking that i ordered and had delivered to another party was recieved by that party and she is so much in love with it . it has such a diverse pattern ( not what is pictured in the ad ) but it has many different possibilities of what she has in her inventory . mixing and matching et al . . . . 
i am around 5 ' 1 and 150 . ok . honestly , 155 . i buy stockings because they usually make me feel sexy . they hide bumps and show off my better features . regarding these stockings : pros : the pattern on this is beautiful . it is fairly durable for a stocking . price was decentlooks great on the model . cons : its to loose in the back ( probably because i ' m short ) its to tight around my thighs ( probably because i ' m fat ) it shows off my cellulite . ( which i already pointed out is usually hidden by this kind of clothing ) and downplays any pleasant curve i have . ( i feel blah in it . ) overall , i ' m disappointed . i will try to dress it up a bit . maybe slip it under a dress ( i love the pattern ) , but i doubt that i will ever like it much . even if hubby does . - - - note : at the suggestion of another reviewer , i tried it on backwards . it looks much better . specifically with a bra . almost like a corset , but not . i think i can wear it this way with a vest or jacket and a short skirt . - - - much happier . 
the item was great it was soft and looked great the only thing was the opening didnt open far enough to the back ( rubed a little but was still great . would buy another . 
this thing is downright sexy . it ' s my husbands favorite lingerie article of mine . i ' m 5 ' 6 " and 130 lbs and it fits me for the most part . i just have a problem with the lacing in the back . it ' s really loose . it might be okay for someone with a bigger chest though , as mine is kind of on the smaller side of the spectrum . 
not only will this turn your beef jerky wife into a prime rib , she can shine up any lack luster leather upholstery . 
this is a very nice bodystocking . you really do not need the piano as a prop . the fit is great , and oh , it looks good on too . 
this ring looks far nicer than its picture ! it is shinier than the picture . it is very well made and the cz stones are sparkly without looking tacky . each of the three rings is not too thick so they roll over each other easily without too much bulk . you do not need to order a larger size due to the overlapping rings making it smaller , the manufacturer already factored that into the sizing . you should just order whatever size you normally wear . this is a great everyday ring that you can wear without worrying about losing it . the seller was very fast in shipping my order . i received it less than a week after ordering . i highly recommend this ring . 
fits perfect ! i wanted that i could fiddle with to keep my hands busy . love it . this one is perfect ! 
i recieved my ring before the est date and love it . it is a nice looking , comfortable and fun ring . i wear on my thumb and find playing with it a stress reliever and boredom buster while sitting in borings meetings . . . nice ring and great price . would def rec to others . 
the look of this ring is okay but it was really bulky as a thumb ring , stopped wearing it after about 1 week 
i was so happy to receive this ring . it came in a cute little silver box , inside of a outside box . it looks so good , it ' s hard to tell that it ' s fake . if you want something nice for a small amount of money get this ! 
this is for the most part a decent looking watch box . its made of a wrapped composite or cardboard like material but seems strong . it ' s smaller than you ' d think holding 20 watches which is nice . i am not crazy about the watch pillows as they have solid sides rather than like a traditional pillow has but they work and can certainly be changed out if necessary . decent hasp and locking system . i ' d suggest this to those needing to properly store upwards of 20 watches . 
fits many watches looks and feels good great constuction . will recommend to anyone looking for a nice sturdy case for there timepieces 
the fit and finish is great . not a single missed stitch . the packaging was also first - rate . very impressive for the price i paid . the watch cusions fit well and the dividers are sturdy . fits my larger watches very well , though they tend to snag upon opening when placed within the bottom tray . i could honestly live without the ridiculous gold handle on the front of the bottom tray . it looks out of place and something you ' d find on a cheap item bought at a street corner swap meet in beijing . other than that minor gripe , this is a decent watch box . 
this box looks nice and seems as if it would be sturdy and hold up , but unfortunately there ' s not quite enough depth for my husband ' s watches . most of them tap the glass when the lid is closed ( they ' re not overly large watches , mostly 43mm ) and when stored in the bottom drawer they scrape the top as the drawer is being closed . if you have smaller watches ( my michael kors women ' s watches fit perfectly , but we had planned on sharing the box ) , this would be perfect . we ' re going to keep looking for a box we can both share . 
nice construction , compact but fits many watches . nice sturdy cushions for the watches . am very happy with it and would buy again . 
i just love this box for my watches . the bad part is that now it ' s not enough for all the watches i do have . great purchase . 
yes , its just what i needed ! ! i ' m just starting my collection . i have 16 large watches , 50mm plus . they fit good . it could be a little bigger but it dies the job , and looks great ! ! ! 
product is great . looks just as pictured . only down side is , if you ' re switch out watches often , some wear and tear occurs on the fabric . it ' s an easy fix though . 
nothing i would classify as being a con if i were to list them . just a nice watch storage / display case . the quality seems to be good . the bottom drawer fits in snugly and all corners line up well . some poorly made ones will have drawers that don ' t sit flush with the body . materials are good . all in all what can be said ? i would recommend it to anyone who wanted a nice quality case for their collection . 
i gave this as a gift and the receiver loved it . it really is very beautifully constructed . and how can you beat holding this many watches for this price ! 
my brother bought this case for his watches a few years back , and why i was somewhat jealous of it , i didn ' t own enough watches at the time and already had a smaller display box . as soon as my collection outgrew the display box i had , i knew what i wanted . this is a gorgeous display box , two drawers ( as pictured ) and includes a lock . in my opinion , the lock is really only going to protect your watches from a small child and otherwise , is just a nuisance ( if you actually lock it ) . nonetheless , each watch sits in its own little protective shell on an individual cushion . that was one thing i disliked about my previous box - it had 5 individual cushions and one long cushion . if you put more than 2 watches on the long cushion , it was a pain to get the watch you wanted off of it . this display box avoids that by providing individual cushions for all 20 watches , each in a sectioned - off area . my only gripe is that you can ' t really put anything else in the box besides watches . i can ' t fault it for that , since it is only meant for watches , but i was hoping i could store some things like my wallet , passport , sunglasses , etc in the bottom drawer . because of the individualized sections built into the box , you can ' t do that . oh well . all in all , this is a great watch display case . summary : beautiful display , two drawers , individualized cushions with built - in sections for each watch . recommend . 
i stayed true to my size and it fit me perfectly , only with some shoes you have to order a size up or down , but new balances always stays true to regular size . the comfortablility in the arch and it also has a double heel support is also amazing , very comfortable shoe , people may say it ' s fake , it ' s not , it ' s exactly how they have it in the store , this shoe is and will be very durable just all long as you don ' t get them soaked or wet all the time , some parts of the shoe is suede so you need to just be cautious with that , no complaints really this is an all around very comfortable shoe with a little style , i like the 574 ' s , only downside i ever had with these shoes is that some people i know think it ' s ugly lol 
krasovki great ! obazhaet their husband , take the time ! this time i will try to take yourself and your child : ) soft , comfortable , warm ! 
these fit beautifully , have a very pleasant color . i chose new balance for comfort . i chose mens size for the width in the toes as i have a ducks foot . i am very pleased with this purchase . thank you . 
my cousin wanted only new balance shoes . so i bought these for him . it is too bad that i bought them in mid october , because i didn ' t see him to give them to him until november 22 . it was too late to return them . they were not only too small , he was shocked that they are new balance brand . he said they are plain junk . he handed them back to me . what do i do with a pair of junk shoes ? and what is new balance thinking to make shoes like these ? 
perhaps the pair that i received were incorrectly marked . they clearly said 13 2e , yet they were 1 / 2 & # 34 ; shorter than other new balance shoes i own . the toe box was narrower as well . i was very disappointed . 
the well engineering designed in shape , color , texture , comfort , balance leg weight distribution designed , color is stunning , appearance is eye catching . 
great fit ! the look is very very nice on i had them on for hours and my feet were fine . its overall a nice fit i needed something quick and i always get plenty of complements on them . love the color / style you can walk in them for hours run skip hop jump . . . its just a nice sneaker . . . its very comfy and its true to size ! i ' m an 8 and i fit the 8 fine ! 
this was my first pair of new balance shoes , so i didn ' t know what to expect . i knew from the first day that these are the most comfortable shoes i have ever owned . these shoes can be used for casual purposes as well as walking long distances . i can ' t wait to buy my next pair ! 
it looked good , i like design too . but after 2 month it became junk . the color went there i do not know . 
i ' ve never owned this brand before . but , i liked what i saw in the picture . . . they simply looked comfortable . and i was right . their light weight , style and color was just what i was looking for . from my experience with these great shoes , i would buy this brand again . 
i ordered these shoes from amazon . they came packaged well but kind of slow on the shipping . i normally can order an item from amazon and have it within a week . i ordered the new balance 574 and it took close to three weeks for me to receive my shoes . the good thing is , i was able to track the shoes via the amazon tracking system which gave me at least peace of mind . the shoes looked exactly like the photo and were brand new , never worn . the new balance 574 is an amazing shoe . i needed to get a new shoe and a friend recommended i try a new balance shoe . i must say , this is one of the most comfortable shoes around . went to a store where they measure your foot to make sure i get the right shoe . it truly does make a difference . if you are considering purchasing this shoe , i suggest this as an option . i hope this review helps . ymmv . . . neosoul . 
does this look like grey at all ? anyone ? i was expecting what i saw in the pic . y dont we read ? ? 
great selection of athletic shoes in amazon ; had a hard time choosing ; didn ' t want anything too flashy or expensive as i just wear them with shorts as casual footwear ; plus , i had a gift card to spend . 
purchased one pair of these at a local new balance store ; came home and checked on amazon ; over 20 bucks cheaper ; ordered these . new balance is one of the only brands that offer wider widths in most sizes and styles . i need a 2e width for my aging feet and they have what i need . i advise going to the store for proper fit then shop on amazon for price . that said , amazon did not have all the newest styles / models but more than adequate selection for me . 
i just keep buying this model year after year , they are perfect tennis shoes , very comfortable , great quality , i still have a pair from 5 years ago . very good for training , running , nothing fancy . just perfecct . 
great shoe , just too small . this shoe is nice and comfortable , justvthe wrong size by a half . returning but getting next size up 
this is my forth pair of new balance 574s and i love them . they are very comfortable and well made . so far each time i ' ve had to get a new pair it was from my wearing the soles down , not from falling apart . one of the things i really like about the shoes too is that aside from looking nice and being well made , they are relatively cheap . i wear a size 15 so it normally cost me a decent amount of money to get shoes . these are generally between $ 30 - $ 45 when i buy them on amazon . if you are looking for a comfortable everyday - shoe then these are a great option especially if you wear larger sizes . 
what can i say that i didn ' t say about all new balance shoes , wears like iron , feels light as a feather and i love the red 
be sure to buy wider than you usually wear , they are quite snug , i ' ve never needed a wide shoe , but in this case it would have mad for a much more comfortable sneaker . 
purchased these for a family member . they really like them ! she says the shoes are extremely comfortable ! i purchased this model of shoe due to the great reviews by others who purchased them . 
i ' ve had several pauirs of these shoes and i ' ll keep buying them . they ' re great for running or any activity , fit good , have great traction , and are simple - looking . i don ' t like flashy shoes and these are the classic design that new balance is known for . i love these shoes . 
i have tried many shoes during my lifetime but i keep coming back to new balance for comfort , functionality , and durability . these ml574 ' s are another in a long line of quality athletic shoes . i like the comfort . there are no & # 34 ; hot spots & # 34 ; in the shoe , and they feel very comfortable when i walk or run . the shoe is made of durable materials . the leather side panels and toe guard give protection and support to the foot , and the toe strap prevents the big toe from coming through the top of the shoe ( a faulty design seen in many running shoes ) . the tread is not excess , so the shoe has functional comfort . my last pair went for 7 years before having to be replaced , and i expect these will do the same . i will purchase another pair of these now because i like them so much ! kone 
i got these for my 64 year old father and he loves them . i tied them loose enough that he could slip them on but tight enough they would then stay on . he is always talking about how comfortable these shoes are to walk in and for a man who doesn ' t like change and had been wearing the same pair of slip on sneakers for close to 10 years that ' s saying a lot ! 
i have tall sons with big ( and in some cases wide ) feet . my oldest wears a size 16 and the next one wears a 15 . you can ' t walk into brick and mortar stores and get shoes for feet that size . even though my younger 3 boys don ' t have huge feet yet , i still choose the new balance brand over others . new balance size ranges , quality , and pricing are consistently reliable . amazon is the best place to get new balance shoes at the best price . forget about other websites and hassling with coupon codes , slow shipping , and difficult returns . amazon ' s free returns and prime 2 day shipping make buying new balance from amazon a no brainer . no penalty if you guess the wrong size . this shoe , in particular , was great for both of my oldest sons . black is perfect to disguise dirt and scuffs . they wear these daily to school , or just to hang out with friends . this is a great sneaker that can be worn with just about anything . thumbs up ! 
good fit . very comfortable too . i like the look . seem to be constructed well so i don ' t expect any issues . 
both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe i ' ve ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . the silver finish is worn off around the edge like they ' d already been used . not a good purchase 
this new balance is very comfortable and looks great ! the 574 it ' s one of the coolest nb on the market 
i have a couple nb shoes now and really like my others . this pair is not a made in usa pair , and it runs a bit small . a 9 . 5 for me in my usa pair was perfect , but i would need a 10 in this to make it work . also , i wasn ' t a huge fan of the design so i returned it and got a pair in grey instead . 
looks great but little narrow . i have only new balance and always size is correct no this shoes . but its ok i think for running its good 
been using my pair for 2 years now . they are durable and quite comfortable . what i love about new balance is that they are available in many widths , mine is 4e . it is almost impossible for me to find a pair in shopping malls . this one fits perfectly . i think the price is not too steep compared to other brands . it is my everyday shoes for work and recreation . it is described as walking shoes but i also use it for some light jogging & tennis . nice minimalistic simple design . leather is supple . . . and yes , the biggest reason i bought it is velcro . 
kinda snug on the sides , wish the wide version was availble , but overall their comfy for everyday use . a recommend 
fits as expected though will agree with a prior / recent review , does make your feet appear way larger . but it ' s a classic look great with jeans , comfortable and hardly goes unnoticed which is something given the shoe has been around for ages . can see myself ordering another pair when the time comes . 
this shoe is so great and at an excellent price . i gave this shoe a 5 star rating because of it ' s comfort and great style . this was the lowest price i ' ve seen . much needed spring shoe . 
good product ! have always ordered new balance products ! this time need to order a larger size . we are sure that all will be fine ! the quality of new balance is excellent ! ! rest assured we will order until the size issue is resolved . 
these are great retro looking shoes . they are very comfy so far , only time will tell if they last very long 
got these for a family member for a gift and they are nice colors and seems to be nice shoes . 
i have been buying the new balance 993 for years . i was expecting a little better quality out of this shoe , even at the cheaper price . i ended up returning them . no problem with delivery or packaging . just didn ' t love the shoe . 
these are the best sneakers i have owned . they came quickly and in excellent condition . i followed a reviewer ' s recommendation and ordered them a half size larger and they fit perfectly . 
looked in all the stores and could not find these shoes . should have started with amazon first as this site has never let me down . 
it ' s very good product . it ' s not too confortable like the other brands . so , if you spent a little more bucks , you can buy one better product . 
great color to add to the collection . own roughly 15 different pairs of new balance 574s , currently . have received many comments on the color from people . make sure to spray with water proof / stain resistance before wearing to ensure long dirt free life . would recommend to anyone looking for a colorful sneaker . order a half size larger than you would normally wear as the shoe seems to run small . 
this is the second time i ' ve purchased this shoe . first pair were amazing ; extremely comfortable and casual . after years of wearing it through the sole i decided to purchase another pair that ' s how much i loved the shoe . well after a week of wearing the shoe the part between the sole and toe had ripped and the shoe became unwearable . felt like sot could not return the shoe after a week of use , and now i feel like i can ' t trust buying this shoe anymore . 
after readying some of he it ' s her reviews on this snake necklace , i thought to chance it anyway . it ' s very pretty , and even sturdy , but my only complaint is , is that my hair gets tangled up in it daily ! 
i love the look and feel of this necklace . very sleek and looks like i paid more for it . i ' m thinking of buying another at a different length . 
great chain . i bought 2 different lengths for myself and one for my sister . they do look awesome with the swarvoski pendants . 
good quality silver - awesome finish - does not hurt and reall value for money . glad i got it 
this is a beautiful item . very high quality necklace , delicate yet strong enough for a larger pendant . it is a good buy ! 
nice quality have had mines for a while now and have had no issues very shiny and the perfect length 
this is just what i was looking for . i needed a shorter chain for a silver pendent charm . the quality is good and the price is perfect . 
i am so happy with my chain it ' s pretty , shiny and came very quickly . . . i have no complaints whatsoever . 
i like the look of this chain but had to return , it was yanking my hair out in chunks within 15 minutes of putting it on . would never buy again . 
this chain is beautiful and fit my pendant that i received for my anniversary but this chain grabs my hair . i can ' t feel any rough areas on it but it will grab and wind pieces of my hair around itself , maybe mine is defective ? even though i don ' t see anything . i ended up using a different chain because i couldn ' t stand having my hair pulled all the time . my hair seems to wrap around near the clasp . this is ok for an occasional wear but i find it unacceptable for daily wear . 
just beautiful ! i love it ! and it will be just perfect for the pendants i purchased . 
these necklaces are made to last long and outshine all others , i wear them everyday and have had them for about 1 year and they have not tarnished . they are still shiny as they were on the first day . 
i ' m sometimes apprehensive about non - amazon sellers , but this product is really great . shines , is sturdy , great price . what ' s not to like ? 
this is just what i was looking for to interchange with my different pendants . it is very pretty and does not overpower the pendants . i will update if i see any issues about quality but i won ' t be wearing it on a regular basis . i do plan to get them in all sizes available and actually already have the 18 " and 20 " sizes . 
i gave two of my son ' s st . christopher medals in 1999 because one had leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant and the other was a perfect match . after these many years one of the chains broke so i purchased this to replace it . it is of great quality and very shiny , also the medal found it ' s place around his neck again . 
this chain , and this particular seller are perfect . i have ordered from gem avenue before and was so impressed by the first purchase that i just had to come back . this chain is beautiful , well made , the clasp is easy and also well made . no worry about it opening at all . the craftsmanship displayed in the making of and finished product of this item reflects the sellers good choice in products and my business is his . 
i love it ! the only thing is i wish the clasp was a little larger . it is hard for my & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; hands to manipulate . otherwise , itis beautiful and just what i wanted . 
i ordered this item based on the picture on the web site . i wasn ' t expecting it to be quite as beautiful , but was very pleased to find quality jewelry at a very affordable price . i plan on ordering several more in different sizes . thanks for keeping this customer happy . 
i love wearing white metal jewelry and a snake chain is my absolute favorite chain to wear as a necklace . this necklace is beautiful in person and comes with a lobster claw clasp . it is pretty substantial in terms of its weight and nice quality . i have placed a sterling silver pendant it on this necklace . i ' d gladly order more of these necklaces should i need one for additional pendants . 
i am very happy with the necklace . i gave up wearing jewelry due to my nickel allergy , but have recently starting purchasing nickel - free jewelry online . i love this necklace and am happy to finally be able to wear jewelry again . i would definitley recommend this to my friends . 
i got this to go on a pendant , for the price this is a very good chain , way better than you can buy out of any store for the price . 
bought this to replace a chain for a gift - love it - nice length for everyday - good quality - qreat price 
i got this chain as a replacement for my old one and this one is nice and shiny . it looks delicate , yet feels durable . i wear it every day , so i guess we ' ll see how long it will last . so far - - a happy camper . 
i own several of these chains . they are very nice , lightweight chains , and you can ' t beat the price . they look much more expensive than they are . they are good alone , one , two , or several , or with pendants attached . with all snake chains , sterling silver or white / yellow gold , be very careful on how you store and travel with them . they are very easy to get crimps , kinks , and bends in them that you can ' t even out , so they don ' t fall around the neck appropriately . don ' t wrap or fold , they should be hung freely on a jewelry hook or when packing for travel , carefully wrap in tissue or soft cloth , flat and fully extended and tuck securely between soft clothes in your luggage . 
i ' m very happy with the appearance and quality of this chain . the pendant i bought it for slides on effortlessly and looks very nice . 
this silver chain is excellent . it ' s a true snake chain and does not tangle ( as snake chains shouldn ' t ) . it also has a nice quality " loop " clasp not those chinsy circular clasps . i got the 16 " chain to hold a small pendant i have . if you are unsure of what size to get the 16 " chain is very close to the neck . i got this specifically because it is a small pendant i was hanging from it and that was how it should hang . the standard chain length is 18 " and hangs right where a necklace should so if you are unsure of what size to get that ' s probably the one you want to go with . 20 " is a longer chain and isn ' t so common but is often used if one is wearing two necklaces and wants them to hang at different lengths so they are both visible . the silver seems to be of good quality and came shiny and polished . it hasn ' t tarnished much at all and cleans nicely with a cleaning cloth . i have had it for a while and don ' t wear it every day but so far there is no discoloration . important : this is a very thin chain . it says in the description and title 1mm but in case one wasn ' t really paying attention to that it is important to note that it is very thin . for me this worked great and it is a beautiful delicate chain but for someone looking for a thick chain this is not the one you want . overall it ' s a great chain and the price is exactly where it should be . 5 / 5 stars 
because of their fantastic prices compared to the competitors , i gave gem avenue a try and bought six chains to go with gift pendants . i was not disappointed ! this chain had great sparkle and draped fluidly as a snake chain should . the clasp was strong ( italian - type ) , and the chain held the pendant securely . so pretty ! the chain , at such a great price , even came in a small gift box that could be wrapped and well - presented . very good customer service , good delivery time . i ' m happy ! 
looked nice for awhile but got all tarnished soon after 
well made and very fluid . it has a really nice lobster claw clasp attached very securely . lots of sparkle and shine . ir looks classy . thanks , gem ave . , it ' s exactly what i was looking for . thanks to all the other amazon reviewers of this piece . i read them all before ordering . update : i purchase two of these chains . i ' ve had them for quite a while and i wear them often . they still look like the day i bought them . the have never tarnished . . . not even a little bit . 
i at amazon andd have owned reptiles , coyotes , and mauis . i love the mauis . they are so clear and stylish . they just look and feel first class . best price at amazon and you know they are authentic ! ! ! 
these are the best sunglasses on the market . i love my wayfarer ray - bans , but these are a cut above . when you look through the lenses , it makes the world " pop " in terms of color . even on a dull day , or if you ' re feeling down or blue , go outside and put these on , and they really lift your mood , just by making the world look a little brighter . not sure how they do it , but its for real . the sides curve around a little , too , to offer sun protection on the sides , really great feature that i don ' t have on my beloved wayfarers ! 
this is my fourth pair of maui jim sunglasses , and the second pair with glass lenses . i have become a firm believer in glass lenses because they offer a clearer , crisper , and overall superior lens compared to polycarbonate . it is a fact that mj lenses are the best in the industry , and mj is still an independent company which makes its own frames and lenses . many other brands are owned by luxottica , and it ' s not so clear cut where frames , lenses , or final assembly originate from . with maui jim , it is either japan or italy . the fit and finish on these glasses is typical of maui jim , which is to say excellent . the temples of these stingrays are rather wide which help to block more sun light from getting into your eyes , but they also block peripheral vision so be aware of that especially when driving . they are very lightweight which makes them really comfortable to wear all day . these glasses come with a semi hard " sport " case , i would prefer a hard clam shell case . overall , this is yet another home run for maui jim , and thanks to their superior products and designs , another dent in my wallet . an absolutely top notch product . made in italy . 
i have worn rx sunglasses for years . i ' ve always worn raybans and didn ' t think i ' d wear anything else . the only down side to rx . lenses , is that you don ' t get the factory lens and the quality seems to vary . recently it was time for new sunglasses . instead of my usual choice i picked up the maui jim stingrays , liked the look and decided they were the ones . i expected the usual aftermarket rx lens , but not maui jim . they do their lenses in - house , so you get the full quality . and these are hands down the finest quality lenses i ' ve ever used , the difference is amazing . it ' s akin to old tv vs hd tv . i can ' t imagine ever owning another brand of sunglasses . yes maui jims are really expensive , it ' s hard to justify the expense until you wear them . so if you want to save money , never wear a pair of maui jim sunglasses , once you do , you will never wear anything else . 
i have never spent this much money on a pair of sunglasses before , usually content with the $ 10 variety but i decided that my eyes were worth the splurge and i ' m so glad i did ! these fit me extremely well and they are very comfortable . i was worried that the glass lenses would make them feel too heavy but i haven ' t found that to be the case at all . everything appears crystal clear through the lenses and it was like seeing clearly for the first time ! as an added bonus , the hard case that came with them is wonderful and a great place to keep them protected when i ' m not wearing them . i ' m looking forward to enjoying these sunglasses for many years to come , unlike the cheap ones that i replace yearly , if not more often , if you are at all on the fence about these sunglasses i recommend you give them a try , you won ' t be sorry ! 
bought for myself . have always liked maui ' s and they were on sale so , score ! excellent lenses . so much nicer than cheap sunglasses . will enjoy them for years and my eyes will appreciate them . 
i ' m loving these ! definitely worth the money in my book . i ' ve paid just as much - and more - for sunglasses w / less lens clarity . go for it ! you won ' t be sorry . 
if your little jedi will be wearing this on a daily basis , i would look elsewhere . for a $ 16 halloween costume , this is perfectly adequate . size medium fit my 52 - 53 & # 34 ; child well with growing room . i would say size is generous except for the boot covers . they are ridiculously small ! the foot flap only came about halfway over his foot . 
this is exactly as pictured and my grandson is very happy with how it is easy for him to get on and off . 
very happy with this costume . fit my 8 year old son a little big , but was fine , better than too small ! i bought a robe separately , and it all went together very nicely . 
this is a good costume for the money . it fits good , seemingly well made . best price ive seen for this costume 
stays looking nice even after poor treatment on the halloween circuit and other events . stains even come out easily . your child will look great in it too . one of the best made , most accurate , and nice looking halloween costumes i have even bought . 
i liked the look of the ring from the picture , but the band itself is quite uncomfortable . the silver bands around the stones are not beveled , but stick into my finger . i had been hoping to find a ring for everyday use , but this isn ' t it . 
i am slightly ocd so in the summer when i wear rings with colors other than dark red and black i like to have a tie in . it really will go with about anything , i love twisting it around on my finger to look at all the beautiful stones . i love it , and i have worn it every day since i received it . 
this band is absolutely beautiful . the sterling looks just like white gold , amazing . the stones look real . i am so glad , i wear it everyday . it suits anything you wear , casual to dressed up . fantastic ring . thank you ! lucie 
if you purchase this product , you should at least buy two since they are small . two or more together makes a nice look - - - one you can hardly see it being worn . 
beautiful ! i ordered 2 of these rings to use on either side of my wedding ring . colors are very visable and you can tell each color . 
the leather feels nice , and this closes even when completely filled . my wife is able to carry all of her cards and check book . she was really happy with this purchase . for the price , this was an excellent purchase . 
this is the perfect wallet for someone who carries a lot in their wallet . i often just carry this instead of my whole purse . it can hold your checkbook , plenty of credit cards , store savings cards , and more . it also has a great calculator and a place to hold a pen for balancing the checkbook . the quality is great and it even comes in multiple colors . 
it is hard to find a wallet that has enough slots for all the credit cards much less expand to fit . this has plenty of room and i love the colors . 
i bought this for my mother who likes a large wallet with lots of slots and function . it also zips , so cards wont fall out . the color is awesome and can be found easily in the bottom of a large purse . looks to be high quality material . this is perfect for what i could not find in the stores . 
i love this wallet . . very nice quality and pretty color . i bought it to go with a purse i bought here at amazon and i love it . 
i got this wallet for my mom to go w / the purse i got her and she loves it . looks great and holds all her stuff . ty so much . 
i was looking to replace my old wallet which seems to be wearing out after long use , searched on amazon and saw this mundi big fat flap wallet and i remembered i had a mundi wallet before which was actually genuine leather and it lasted forever till i just decided to give it away ! i knew this wasn ' t leather but because i needed more room , i went ahead and ordered it . well , it is big and fat alright , but was expecting it to have more room for credit / business cards or rather some room where i could insert the credit / business card sleeves that i had in the old one plus the check books . wrong ! ! it has a few slots for the cards , tried to insert the sleeves but only managed one with about 8 cards , the check book goes in tight , it has four windows for photos . . . good if you carry photos , but could have used some of the space for cards , anyway , i chose to keep it but ordered a crazy shopping leather unisex business case wallet id credit card case . . . 
it is well made and holds everything . i just wish there was a left - handed version . it ( like most wallets ) is awkward for lefties . 
i would have loved to give this 5 stars but the black was not as shown ( white stitching ) . the one i received has black stitching . other than that - this is an awesome wallet with enough pockets for everything . it ' s so hard to find a wallet that can fit everything in it . medical cards for me and my kids , credit card , debit card , discount card , gas card , driver ' s license , costco membership card , coins , checkbook , receipts , coupons and cash . they all fit ! 
after my favorite expensive leather wallet stopped snapping shut , i came here to find something to hold all of my junk until i get a nice new one . after reading the reviews and the inexpensive price , i bought this wallet and it came in last night . it is perfect for me ! plenty of room for cards , cash , change , checkbook , etc . i will be keeping this until it falls apart ! 
it ' s so big , it ' s just like the one i bought a the discount store , it ' s living in a drawer now . 
bought this for an early mother ' s day present for my mother who loves the large wallet clutch . loved the calculator and all the slots and compartments . thought there could have been more space where you could slide paper but it was sewn down . read previous reviews about the product not wearing well but we will wait and see . what i did notice was a very strong odor of plastic or color dye . not sure what it is . we are hoping the smell will dissipate soon . smell is the reason for 4 stars . 
i gave this a 4 because i havent got to use it yet since it is a christmas gift and under the tree . but i looked at it before it was wrapped and it has a ton of storage space and i really think i am going to like this wallet when i get to use it . i will update if it falls apart prematurely or something , but i have high hopes that it won ' tupdate : immediately transferred all of my things to it and started using it on christmas day ! still in perfect condition ! and i ' ve really grown to appreciate all the space it has and the different spaces to organize my stuff . most of the time i just carry my wallet instead of a purse , so this fit the bill perfectly ! i bought the red , great color , i get compliments on this wallet a lot . great buy ! 
it is huge - - - everything you own you can easily organize into this wallet - - made well - sturdy - soft - - but know you must have at least a medium size pocketbook for it to fit in . . . this is no small wallet . 
love the wallet . i was misled though because i think they have the chart color mixed up . thought i was getting red but got the green . the apple green is definitely green . i love the two part compartments ; i . e . , cash / coins on one side - credit cards on the other . i ' ve always had purses where i carried the credit cards built within the purse . thought i would have trouble converting to this , but so far it ' s even faster getting my cards out and back very quickly . plenty of room for cards and more . if you are looking for a compact wallet , this is not what you want . however , it ' s sleek enough to fit in a medium size purse . i ' ve wasted a lot of money on wallets , so this is the first one that i ' ve been satisfied with . 
finally , i can carry everything i need to carry in my wallet without it being overstuffed ! i love the zip pocket and the great organization pockets under the flap . can even be used as a hand purse if necessary . love it . 
nice - holds everything , and is able to expand if needed . actually has enough spots to store customer courtesy cards ( coffee , etc ) without losing them . 
i received the wallet on time . i just love it . it is very roomy . has alot of space for plenty of credit cards . it has several spots for cash . i choose the black one . the wallet looks expensive and is a very nice quality . you even get a calculator for checkbook purposes . it is worth the purchase price . 
its big , its . red and it has a flap . make sure you have a large purse to carry this in . lots of places for cards . decent quality for the price . 
this wallet is well - made and has secure zippered pockets for cash , coins , as well as a generous amount of slots for credit cards , a pen , a clear window pocket for my driver ' s license , and more . it could accommodate my checkbook too , but i don ' t varry that with me every day . i have been using it for more than a month and looks great . 
this is a quality wallet . if you don ' t mind how large the wallet is then this is the wallet to own . it will hold just about everything you need to hold in a wallet . 
i have always like mundi wallets and then one is no exception . i like the color and will purchase this brand wallet when i need another color . 
has lots of room for all your stuff . all kinds of pockets and places for id ' s and credit cards . . . never had wallet that would hold so much . love it and the color ! ! 
this is the perfect wallet , if you need lots of space . i have everything in order , inside all its compartments . beautifull red , i love it ! 
" big fat " is misleading . this wallet is no bigger or fatter than most wallets that hold a checkbook , lots of cards , change , etc . it is quality leather , a cheery red color , and has a satisying number of compartments . highly recommended . 
really , imeant it . this is the best wallet i ' ve ever owned . i ordered the red one and the color is beautiful , the leather is soft but durable and it ' s not designed like any wallet i ' ve ever bought . i looked at so many styles , prices and but i kept going back to this one . the versatility of this one is beat out all the rest . i will order this one again ( in 10 years ) . this wallet will last this long because of the quality in it . please muundi , do not ever stop producing this wallet . this would be a gift for any woman to cherish for years , i will be giving this to the women in my life . there many beautiful colors to choose from . the features in this wallet are many but my favorite one is the separate zippered compartment for money . i appreciate not having to open the entire wallet to get cash . buy this you will love it . 
i had a wallet just like this that i loved but it started to fall apart . when i received this , it was just like my other one . big , but not too bulky , and holds everything that i need . plenty of room for all of my cards , etc . great quality for a great price ! 
it holds all that i need to carry & that ' s a lot . it looks like it ' ll hold up under a lot of wear & tear ! 
this is a mini school bus , a red one , but it works for me . i carry everything in this purse . it holds a lot of stuff and i sometimes leave my pocketbook at home and just roll ( pun intended ) with it . i ' ve had it for a while and it is durable - - - no tears , nothing . 
great wallet for the price ! ! my only complaint is that i wish there was more expansion room - it can be difficult to snap the flat down . 
i have a wallet similar to this one that i have used for over 10 years . it is starting to fall apart so i was looking for a replacement . this was the closest i could find and am thrilled with it ! plenty of places to move my id ' s , credit cards , and so on over . one limitation of this type of wallet is that it doesn ' t hold a lot of change very well - - so i just dump it into the bottom of my purse . the advantage of the larger wallet is i can grab it from my purse and i have what i need . i can put it in a briefcase for meetings , then transfer back to the purse for dinner . this makes my life simple - - just one thing to worry about ! 
i travel a lot ! over time , my wallet was crammed with more crap than i knew what to do with . even if i sat down to discard some of the most unnecessary crap , i found that i was never able to get rid of anything . so , if you can ' t beat ' em ; join ' em . which is what i did . this wallet is amazing ! it holds all my crap with room to spare . there are several zipper compartments and the slits for the credit cards , driver ' s license , etc . were the perfect size allowing me to easily slip my cards in and out without resistance . . . something that is usually a problem for most wallets . this is the first wallet that i can actually carry my checks in without straining the snaps . . . of which , there are two that will allow me to add more crap . i have nothing negative to say about this item . it was a perfect purchase for me ! 
i love this wallet ! it ' s got tons of room . . . credit cards , license , check - book , cash - slot , zippered area for change , insurance - card slot , and an area for receipts and such . . . thus wallet has a place for everything i need to have on hand . you also gave a variety of colors to choose from . the stitching and zippers are very sturdy . price of the wallet is very reasonable , shipping was fast , it was well packaged . this is my # 1 fav wallet ever ! 
i suspect i ' m like a lot of people - - trying to find a wallet that works for everything , each new purchase falling slightly short of the mark . not so with the mundi big fat flap wallet ! this one is it ! i purchased my first mundi from another source - - a lovely pale beige nubuck number . i ' ve had it for almost a year now , and it ' s holding up extremely well , despite living daily in my book bag ( i ' m a full - time " non - traditional " university grad student ) and being transferred several times a week into my purse . it ' s starting to show a little wear - - just a bit of shine around the edges of the nubuck , not a hint of wear on the interior ( i haven ' t noticed any problems a previous reviewer had with it picking up " grime " - - maybe i keep my hands cleaner or something ? ) , but it still functions perfectly . it holds all my cards ( student id , copy card , credit cards , insurance cards ) with room to spare . cash is securely stowed in the zippered compartment . checkbook and pen have their own places . and it fits in a smallish kipling bag that i use for day - to - day errands . it ' s maybe a bit larger than your typical " checkbook wallet " - - so bear that in mind if you carry a really small purse . i just ordered my second mundi big fat flap wallet , this time in red from amazon for a much better price than i paid for the beige . no more annual wallet purchase trying to find the right fit ! this one ' s for life . 
i absolutely loveeeeeeeeee this wallet . it has a lot of storage and it doesn ' t look sloppy . the leather is a good quality and expands if necessary . 
have to say that i carry a large wallet now that holds everything i need . it is starting to fall apart so i was hoping this wallet would satisfy my needs . this particular wallet only has a zipper compartment in the side that zips while the wallet i have has side pockets inside the zipped area so i am not going to be able to use this new wallet as well as i used my previous wallet . it ' s not a bad wallet just wish it had more options inside it . for its size it doesn ' t utilize the space well . 
i ' ve been trying to retrieve info for return but when i brought my ipad to cvs to print out the return the print was too small i ' m trying to cope with my husbands death which keeps me from concentrating on this return . i plan to call amazon and explain why i still haven ' t returned this pkg . i don ' t have a printer for my ipad and my computer is not working . this wallet is too big for the bag i ordered it for 
this is a lovely wallet with the capacity to hold so much more than your average lady ' s wallet . slots , zippered storage , a place for your checkbook , cash and change . it is definitely an all - in - one . i highly recommend it ! 
gf had big old micheal kors clunker with a massive faux lock on it which eventually fell off , so replaced it with this . basic nice color , incredibly convenient and practical . nyon inside and leather out , makes for a solid functional peice of kit and the color makes for it being very eye catching and pleasant at the same time . for the price it is amazing . wouldn ' t get anything other than this unless you wanted the words prada or kate spade on it somewhere . 
absolutely love it ! it ' s beautiful and bright red . there are so many compartments to put things to keep your wallet organized so you know where everything is . the only problem with it is there is a little hole in the side where you keep your money and change . it ' s not big enough for your bills to fall out , so will keep it . other than that , it is a nice wallet . 
wanted something functional and with a little pizzaz . love all the compartments and the softness of the wallet . seems well made and that it will last . highly recommended . 
if you are one of those people that seems to have an ever increasing amount of items in your wallet no matter how much you throw out this your item . iy really hold a lot and is sectioned off nicely so you can get at those cards , lots of them , easily . has several windows for id ' s or pictures . only draw back is it made from something other that leather and has a limited life if you are using it all the time . my first one lasted over a year and i really beat it up so it probably would hold up longer with slight care . i have yet to find one that holds as many cardxs as this does or is as organized as well . amazon ' s price is fair andthis product is a good buy . 
i finally broke down and purchased this wallet after months of waffling . . . not because of the wallet itself but the fact that i had to decide to give up my old wallet which had fallen apart . when i received this one from amazon i was so pleased with its concept and design . it holds everything i need to take with me at moment ' s notice , contains slots and pockets for change , checks , receipts , credit cards , you name it ! it ' s a little larger than the one i used to carry but it ' s functionality makes it worthwhile . 
i bought this wallet for my wife for christmas . i was worried that it might be overly fat and bulky , but the size turned out to be just what my wife liked about it . she packs in all of the stuff she needs for shopping including a bunch of coupons . the workmanship in this leather wallet is excellent . 
love the material , the color is less minty and more sage than the photo may show , and it is tidy inside , just what i looked for for a long long time . 
its large , but not obnoxious big . it holds everything i need to carry to run to the store without a purse . its nice quality , soft leather . i would buy this for a gift or again in a different color if needed . i have so much room in this wallet i now tend to misplace my things i tried stuffing in old wallet for years . i know they are in this wallet . . . i just cant find them quickly until i am used to using it over and over again . i guess that is the only drawback . so big i lose things in it ! ha . 
i love the wallet . nice size . very happy i got it . i would say it was a wise , smart , buy . love it . 
this wallet is everything it is advertised to be , and more . the workmanship is great , the leather is nice and not too thin , and it definitely has plenty of room and slots to hold much more than just your spare change ! the best part , though , has got to be the price ! it is incredible to be able to purchase a leather wallet of this quality at this price . even if it only lasts me a year , it will certainly be worth it ' s cost to me ( i ' ve owned leather wallets that have only lasted that long and they were 4 times more expensive than this one ) . the wallet is definitely big , as its name implies . fortunately , with the large handbags now in vogue , this will not be a problem for most women ! i plan on purchasing several more as gifts . just a great product , all around ! 
i am extremely disappointed with this wallet . yes , it ' s big . yes , it ' s fat . but it doesn ' t take much of anything . if you put a checkbook into the checkbook slot , you can ' t close this wallet . no way , no how . yes , it has room for eight credit cards , but can you close it with eight credit cards in it ? nope . yes , it has a zippered compartment on the outside , but it ' s not big enough for keys or pretty much anything at all . the only useful section is the zippered one with the two pockets on the inside , so basically you have this one tiny useful section surrounded by a big , bulky , useless outer shell . oh , and even with practically nothing in it , the flap in front ( barely ) snaps shut sideways . sideways ! can you believe i have to have a separate purse in my bag just for my keys , key ring with all my store cards , and my cell phone ? it ' s insane . and what ' s this & # 34 ; w / calculator & # 34 ; nonsense ? there ' s no calculator ! i ' m really mad at myself for spending money on this useless piece of rubbish . 
i ' ve been using this wallet for a few months , now . my wallets take a beating and this one only looks nicer and , more supple , with use . i still have not utilized all the card slots and compartments , because there are so many of them . actually , so many of them , that if you filled them all up at once , it might take some time to remember where you put everything . i purchased the tan version and it looks exactly like the picture . there ' s space for photos , credit cards , checkbook and register , coins , cash , and lots of little places to stash receipts , shopping lists , coupons , etc . it ' s really all you would need for a quick run to the grocery , or for many other errands when you don ' t want to lug a purse . i think the price is a steal for the workmanship and organizational ability of this wallet . that said , i have plans to keep this item on my potential gift list for friends and family . it arrives ready for gifting , in a nice mundi box , wrapped in tissue paper . it looks every bit worth the retail price . remember to take that little retail tag off of the item before gift giving . the wallet is stamped ' genuine leather ' and it definitely has the look and feel of real leather . i was a little concerned with the strong smell when i first opened the box - - - a chemical smell . i suspect this could be from the leather dye , but i ' m not sure . i left it to air out for a while and it eventually dissipated . if gifting , think i would do this first . also remember that for a wallet to have all these functions , it has to be large , and it is rather heavy . it will take up a lot of real estate in your handbag . if you ' re one who likes to carry small , over the shoulder handbags , this might not work out well for you . 
the wallet was just as described . it is large enough to hold everything . matches my red purse perfectly . when i need another wallet i will definitely order from amazon again . 
love this wallet . good quality , and everything i need in a wallet . even enough pockets for all of my & # 34 ; plastic & # 34 ; . & # 128516 ; 
they are not kidding when they say big fat wallet . you can fit just about anything in this wallet and feel nothing . it reminds me a lot of thealicia klein wallet " park avenue " only roomier . i recommend getting this wallet if you need one that can a lot in it . 
this is my first ever large wallet . i am only giving it four stars because honestly , i have no idea what to do with half of it . it ' s well made , beautiful , holds everything that i need it to , and even comes with a little calculator ( how cool is that ? ! ) . but i am a bit overwhelmed by all of the pockets and nooks and crannies , and even though i probably shouldn ' t need one , without an instruction booklet , i feel as though i am wasting usable space in this awesome wallet . 
it has all the credit card slots and zippered pockets and check register like my old wallet had that was just worn out . the color is absolutely beautiful . i ' m thinking of ordering it in other colors to have as backups for when this one gets worn because it is the first one i ' ve found that is as good as my old wallet . 
it is quite slim actually , and fits very well in most pocketbooks . it is odd because , as described , it has many pockets . zippered parts , room for credit cards , etc . in fact , it has so many compartments i ' m still not sure where i put what ! it looks expensive and very well made . great wallet - if i had seen it in a store i would have paid much more for it . thank you amazon ! ! ! ! 
got this for my wife and she was fine with it for about a week , then the zipper broke , then it ripped . 
i ' ve had a & # 34 ; my big fat wallet & # 34 ; , in brown for over 10yrs ! it is tired , finally with the zipper broken , snap broken , and yet was holding onto using it because i just figured it wasn ' t made anymore . was very happy to of course find it on amazon . it is not a trendy little thing with a handle like what is so popular for running around , etc . it is a big wallet with lots of places for cards , change , bills , check book , pics , whatever you want to put in it . i haven ' t changed mine out yet , but just today a young trendy woman said she loved my wallet ! so of course i told her about them and showed it to her . she said & # 34 ; how perfect , if it just had a handle ! & # 34 ; . . . maybe that is in the future . . . hello mundi ? ? ? ? very happy with my new red one , and must find time to switch and clean out my trusty old one . highly recommend this great quality leather wallet ! 
after looking for a perfect size wallet at stores , i found this at $ 16 . 99 at amazon . to tell you the truth i didn ' t believed , because of the pictures , that this wallet could have enough space . when finally arrived ( quickly with amazon prime ) , this was a surprise ! finally all my cards will be in a same place and my coins , my receipts . . . . . i mean everything ! . is not the best quality as leather , but for the price and condition , is for far the best wallet that i have . this wallet also comes with a calculator , as describe in pictures . 
this is the 3rd invicta watch that i have purchased from amazon . the 2 tone bracelet is just stunning . . . had to remove 2 links and fits fantastic . probably 1 of the best looking watches that i ever owned . keeps great time , only off 2 seconds over 3 days . so glad i got the 38mm face . . watch looks like it meant for my wrist . i also have a 43mm invicta . i now prefer this over the oversize divers watch . i will probably purchase invicta again . 
i know very little about watches , but i received this one by fed ex today through amazon . it ' s a very sexy piece ! the two tone band coupled with the rich blue face also make it very versatile with different attire as your " metals " will always have a match . the rich blue face seems to change shades depending on lighting at times taking on a deep purple - ish look . the somewhat sleekish design sits well on smaller wrists . as far as i can tell so far it ' s keeping perfect time . i ' m not crazy about the sight bubble over the date window . it ' s a raised bubble on the glass that rounds out the number ( s ) like a fisheye effect making somewhat difficult to read , at least for me . this is why i only gave it a 4 . i see the grand diver has a much better date window . i took it to get a couple links taken out of the band . the jeweler couldn ' t believe this watch was only a hundred bucks . he thought it was at least 200 to 300 . 
excelente reloj de muy buena fabricacion y calidad , ha llegado en tiempo y forma a destino , recomiendo a este vendedor . 
excelente watch , decided to buy it for me and was the best decision . . . the watch looks very luxury , the material is hard and good , the design is awesome , good brand , price and worth it . . . 
very nice watch . i was really looking forward to using this as a watch to go out etc . . . but after wearing it a few times ( worn 3 times ) the glass / crystal scratch . disappointed . other than that the watch has a purple hue and the gold and metal contrast are very nice . 
love the watch . attractive and functional . excellent dive and snorkel watch nice edition to my collectionif i said any more i would have to buy another one . 
i bought this for my son who ' s in the navy . as soon as he opened this gift he was in awe . he couldn ' t believe he was the new owner of an invicta watch . this was perfect for him with the face color and having both silver and gold on the band . he was very excited to get some of the links removed so he could wear it . the price was amazing . 
good watch for the price . looks and operates as described . smaller than the large watches , but nice dress watch . have not tested the water resistance 
to small for me 
attractive and small homage to the rolex submariner ( which i don ' t even know if there is a woman ' s submariner ) . it looks great on her . 
great watch for a great price . easy to read . love the magnifier over the date . makes it really easy to see . not a big dial so looks great for work . 
feels not at all substantial like other invictas i ' ve seen . also , if you have a large wrist , forget it . i have another invicta women ' s watch and had to revive links . . . this watch , even on the biggest setting , was uncomfortably tight . disappointing . 
after much research , this is one of the few nice diver watches for women ! my husband saw mine and loved it so much that we ordered a matching one for him ( # 8932 ) . if you prefer automatic , go with model 9321 . pros - - - - - high quality material and finish . the bracelet and the watch is very solid . - nice presentation with the large invicta box - great value - watch afficianados have compared the look and quality of this watch to the rolex submariner ! cons - - - - - generic instruction manual - the manual can be used for invicta ' s entire line of watches so there is only a paragraph about operating screwed - down crowns . 
this watch is great , my wife loves it . its dressy , classy , and it is the right size for her . it fits right in with day to day schedule . 
the watch does not have the tighten crown to make water resistant and the dial is extremely hard to see in dim light . i wound not recommend this watch . some of the other styles may be fine , but , stay away from the black face . 
my husband got me this watch for a vacation where we would spending a good amount of time doing water sports and he didn ' t want me to lose my citizen eco - drive taking it on and off all the time . i get so many compliments on this watch - even my jeweler commented on what a great watch it was ! 
hello , i bought this bracalet women watch , to my wife , she love it , very nice and thin , well she wears small size , so it fits just fine 
this is a very stylish and functional watch . it can be worn when dressed to the nines or hiking in the outback . 
very nice time piece , but size is very small hard to read the time . this watch is better suited for a petite women with a very small wrist . it ' s a great watch through . 
this watch looks more expensive than it is . i bought it to use when i don ' t want to take my expensive watch , and i wasn ' t disappointed on the looks . it ' s a beautiful watch . 
i have been using this as a dress watch as the face is smaller and it looks elegant . i only wish the band had more adjustment , it is a bit on the tight side . 
all the bells and whistles that a high end watch should have . very impressive quality for the price . 
the battery stopped after only a few months and time and date is off . face is small but heavier than it looks 
purchased this watch as a gift for my girlfriend . . . very impressed with it so far . she showers , swims and wears it all day without it missing a second . nice color on it as well . 
a dead ringer for the rolex submariner . same two - tone band and blue face . watch is sturdy and appears to be good quality . if it only lasts a few years , it ' s worth the money . my wife loves it . i bought the man ' s version , less than $ 90 . 
excelente reloj invicta , muy buena calidad y dise & ntilde ; o , ha llegado a destino en tiempo y forma , ademas recomiendo a este vendedor 
i was looking for a wife for my wife that she can wear daily as well as formal . this is nice watch but i had to return it because the face was too small for her . she wanted a little bigger face size . overall its still a beautiful watch . 
the watch is very small but thick . it is very nice and the wife wears it regularly to work with no issues . 
it ' s a very good quality and i have received several compliments . i am anally fussy , and was not disappointed one bit . i got it for my trip to puerto rico because i was going to do snorkeling . i hope you enjoy it as much as i do . oh , and it works great around and under water too ! 
a very nice watch . very nice presentation . the watch is very good . the price is ec & oacute ; nomico clock , so the clock is keeping the price . recommended 100 % 
i didn ' t like the black face and found the time too difficult to read . the size is excellent for a women ' s watch , but i thought the gold accents looked tacky and some users said they scratched off . it does have the moveable outer ring for timing dives . 
the watch looks great and definitely looks five times what it actually costs . the dial size is however smaller than expected - which works since it is supposed to look girly - but we were hoping for a larger dial ( or at least as big as it seems in the pic ) . the men ' s variant on the other hand looks like its thrice its size if not more . we bought them as a set so are satisfied . 
this is my second invicta watch and i really appreciate their quality . the fit is great , the watch goes wherever i do , and i can rely on it wholeheartedly . 
the watch looks great on . the clasp is a little wide . i haven ' t got my reading glasses out to see what the little gold letters say on the watch , but my daughter read them out loud to me . thankfully , you don ' t really need to read it to tell time . 
an attractive and expensive looking watch that keeps near perfect time . face is smaller than its picture . however , as i have small wrists , this is a great fit . i like the look and feel of the watch , and it continues to attract attention wherever i go . don ' t mind that it runs on a battery . it seems to keep time just as well as my other invicta that is self winding . i would recommend this watch to anyone interested in a reliable , accurate , and attractive watch . the only reason i did not give it a five star rating is because the face is a bit small , and this may not appeal to men with large hands and writs . 
classic design by invicta . expect nothing but excellence when purchasing an invicta . definitely will have people complimenting you wrist with this timepiece on . highly recommend it . 
i wanted a watch that would pass for quality to the lay person . i was not expecting much because of how cheap this watch was , but it really looks like a watch that you could get for $ 15 bucks somewhere else . i will add that i do not know much about watches , but my wife and i took it out of the box and instantly decided we should return it . if you are going to go with a cheap watch and don ' t care , i would just say to get a simple one from walmart or something . this watch will not fool people for being high - end . i am just going to save up for something a little nicer looking . 
they came broken . first of all they were always going late . and in one week they stopped forever . we even changed the battery it didn ' t work . it was waste of money . and it was a gift , so i did feel myself very bad . 
this watch has the looks and durability of a watch priced in the 1 , 000 ' s . it has the weight , look and feel of a watch costing 10 to 15 times as much ! i have received many , many compliments on this beautifully made watch . buy one for yourself and start your own " wow " factor ! this watch will knock your socks off and i am not easily impressed ! 
this is the fourth invicta watch i have purchased , this watch is very nice . presented well in yellow invicta signature box . only draw back was it has a smaller face . the watch was in the men ' s watch category and appears like a woman ' s watch . quite a little too much gold . would have rather picked the pro diver silver with gold accent . over all nice watch if you are prepared for the smaller version . think i was just use to the bigger signature face . 
this watch is beautiful , fits well and a nice size without being oversized . i ' m right - handed so i wear it on my left wrist and because it ' s a lefty watch it catches the attention of folks that see the knobs on the " wrong " side . definitely an eye catcher with the black on gold accent . 
this watch does not have an expensive feel to the pushers and the movement does not have an exacting appearance . it has a less expensive dispostion about it . but , it is a less expensive timepiece . for the money it is a great purchase . the only real dislike is that some of the chrono hands are brushed metalic and it almost looks like foil - sort of cheese looking . to have held the watch in my own hand , i probably would not have purchased it . however , the band was exceptional in fine leather . 
this is the 14th invicta watch i own . originally i purchased this watch for my son , who is not a lefty , but who wanted a watch that the crown didn ' t dig into his hand . i was so jealous of his watch , i bought one for me . very good product , and a screamin ' value ! 
this is a great watch to have . its a great size and it works great , i had this watch for while now and it still works like new . 
this is very accurate . it glows in the dark better than my very , very expensiveu - boats . wear it biking / skootering around crummy manhattan where they grow disasterslike the worldtradecenter than cover it up with 9 / 11 . ( 9 / 11 is 911 the police emergency telephone number ) . of course radical , rogue newspeople are / were called in to make it look an expose when they are in fact covering it for tv and the telephone companies not to mention the crummy cops / fbi / secret service . the crummiest canard of all time . the building collapsed at the speed of gravity which is impossible due to the floors slowing it down . they showed a face so i guess that is sufficient or made some sickening gesture ( what kind of crap is that ) . the authorities knew that the worldtradecenter was afoot at the least . williamshakespeare roughly : they had their ambitious finger in the pie . tough for the government and the metro area leaders . and finally so some crummy , lousy cops could get a pension . it is relatively shock proof so i can do strength bar stuff with it on ( preposition ) . it is not nearly as good as my expensive u - boats ( two from amazon ) . some gent made a crack on amazon reviews about the invicta line looking like cheap , tv crap with exaggerated retail prices . well , he is right . the invicta looks like maggie may in sunlight . it looks cheesey but it keeps time real well . it glows in the dark . and now the price is about $ 15 . xx more expensive . made in linux raring ringtail 13 . 04 because windows 8 does not have the native ability to turn off the trackpad . redmond gives you nothing . if i had one iota of commonsense i would take typing lessons . my compositional skills stink . 
i wanted a windup watch because i am trying to use less battery - powered objects in my life . this watch was very reasonably priced , arrived quickly and i have been wearing it now for about 4 years or more . it came in a nice " tin " and promptly went onto my wrist , where it has served me well . i can wind it for a good long time , which means it can sit around for a while , off my wrist ( like overnight or a day or two ) and won ' t run down on me , no batteries to replace , either , so only an occasional memory lapse makes it stop . the nylon watchband has lasted all this time with little or no wear . it gets a little scuzzy ( smelly ) from sweat now and then , but a spritz with a disinfectant and a cursory toweling off will revive its more pleasant aspect . when i wore my battery watch with its " tank tread " metal band , all kinds of dirt , plus sweat , kept getting trapped in the nooks and crannies of the band , and i had to take it off the watch and dip it every so often to kill the odors . one thing i was not too crazy about is the little tiny window on the face of the watch that shows the date - - and now after x amount of years ( i think 4 at least ) this watch is beginning to gain time . waterproof ? i would not test it to find out - - water resistant - - yes , definitely so . but i ' m happy with it , except for . . . . . scuze me now - - i have to synchronize my watch with my cell phone again , perhaps a trip to the watch doctor for an overhaul and cleaning mught not be a bad idea . 
i ' ve been searching for an old - fashioned wind - up watch because i ' m tired of buying watch batteries and having the old ones end up in a land fill . this is exactly what i wanted . plus the band isn ' t leather , which i won ' t buy , and it ' s not plastic which i also don ' t like . and olive happens to be one of my favorite colors . the trick is getting used to winding a watch every morning again . but it ' s worth it to not have to buy batteries anymore . 
it ' s not often that you can find a hand - wind watch that ' s not a luxury model anymore . i don ' t know why , the technology has existed for a couple hundred years now . anyway , when i saw this hand - wind watch at an inexpensive price , i figured it would be a good addition to my collection . haven ' t been disappointed , but maybe that ' s cause i wasn ' t expecting much . it does seem a little cheap . who knows how long it will last ? but again , it ' s something different , and i like that . 
this is a hand - wind watch . it is rare to find a wrist watch with this mechanism that is not an antique . the nylon band absorbed a lot of water during a morning run . othewise , it is a good fit . the arms , especially the second hand is easily visable for those of use with failing eyesight . based on a limited measurement , 3 points , the watch is running fast by an average of 39 seconds per week ( 2 min . 36 seconds per month ) . the students t for a 95 % confidence interval is 68 seconds maximum and 10 seconds minimum . all of these values are positive . the watch runs fast . this is an error which is probably unusual for those familar with quartz technology ( + / - 2 - 4 seconds per month ) all in all , this is an excellent watch for working outside , hunting , even running . the next tests will be time to unwind . it is performed by winding the watch , carefully , to maximum and then allowing it to wind down . with one sample point : 51 hours to unwind from maximum at 74 f . if this review was helpful , please add your vote . thanks . ps : for accurate time - keeping , wind the watch in the morning and at night . otherwise , it will lose time if wound once a day . after 18 months of use the nylon band is wearing at the edges . otherwise , as time piece the watch works well . after about 30 months of severe use , the first watch is done . stick a fork in it ! winding the watch has always been a little tricky . the main shaft grinds a lot , especially if you turn it full stroke . it works best if you gently roll it , moving it less than an 1 / 8th of an inch with every turn . i wore it as my work watch every day for 3 months in the tropics . tough watch . it was constantly wet from sweat or rain . the crown is not very resistant to scratches so it was in pretty bad shape after a few weeks . the accuracy severely declined during this duty . the watch band is noticably lighter than the new watch i purchased as a comparison . the accuracy is now so bad that after wearing it everyday for running and biking then everyday for a plant commissioning job , it sits on the shelf waiting for a last trip the the trash bin . all in all , not a bad watch . as with most things , a bit disappointing in the end . 
this wristwatch is perfect since it is windup and has the 24 hour markings . i use it daily and it has not failed me . it is also the perfect size for the wrist , comfortable and easy to read . 
bought this watch for my partner . she loves it . she is very active and wears the watch when she plays golf and kayaks . it ' s tough , durable and stylish . 
cheap watch for a cheap price . very tiny case and dial that is hard to read . would probably not make for a good actual diver watch if used that way . 
looks great on my wife , matches my watch that i had got to wear at same time . glows well at night . time settings easy , great color , well made . 
i have to admitt i was a little skeptical when i saw the price of this watch . i was amazed at the quality and really . . beauty of this little timepiece . it is so comfortable to wear , the face is really pretty , its just so comfortable i forget i have it on . i love this watch and would love to have bought two . great price for great qualiity . . thanks 
it arrived on time as promised . i ' ve owned several invicta watches and they have tolerated rough wear and deep dives . the band is too large for my small wrist ( not their fault ) . spoke to the watch store and they made me aware that after all links are removed , i can adapt it further to my wrist , by adjusting the clasp . it is a great looking watch . they offered to exchange this one for another but with the recommendations they made , i think the watch will fit fine . 
the watch is awesome , looks great and the blue really jumps out . the size is what i expected , not as big as other invictas but what i wanted for an everyday watch . i have worn it for a few days in and out of the water and it is working great . the band was very easy to size , over all very satisfied . 
this watch is very good looking . the face is not huge and looks good . the only problem i have is the description states a screw down crown . not true . i dont know if this is going to let water come in or not . only time will tell . 
this is a great product . love these watches . packaged great and everything i expected . will be purchasing more in the future . 
excellent product , received in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to give it for a gift its perfect cheap and also nice . higly recommended 
i like the watch extremely well , but the band is very uncomfortable to me . i even contacted speidel to see if they make a twist o flex or a leather band that would fit this watch . they advised me that do not make a band to interchange with these new type watch bands . i will wear this new watch , but not as often as i had planned . if anyone knows of a fix for this problem , i would like to know what it is . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
edit - you can see my previous review below . when the watch arrived the movement was not working . i went out and paid $ 15 to get the battery replaced and the watch started working . it periodically would be 3 - 4 minutes off but i would adjust it and move on with my life . then it really started getting bad , it would be off my 15 - 45 minutes and finally completely quit . i thought , " no problem " i ' ll just return it to amazon ! however , i looked and saw that i was 48 hours past the return date . " ok , " i thought . . . . no problem , i ' ll just return it to invicta ! then i looked and saw that there is a $ 28 shipping charge for warranty service . so i bought a $ 50 watch , replaced the $ 15 battery and am now expected to pay $ 28 to get it fixed . no thanks . i ' m done throwing good money after bad . the watch is trash , do not buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the watch looks great , and that ' s all that i really cared about . however , the watch arrived with a dead battery which required me to spend $ 15 at a jewelry store to get it replaced . when you ' re buying a watch this inexpensive that ' s a huge negative . it also doesn ' t actually have a rotating dial for diving , which many of the other reviews have noted . which begs the question , why doesn ' the seller just change the description ? 
bought it for my grandpa and he really love it , the quality , design , price and how it looks is the best , very good brand and you received exactly what you deserve 
this was a birthday present for a friend of mine and blue is is all time favorite color and he absolutely loves this watch 
a nice looking watch except for the fact that the writing at the bottom of the face is crooked , which spoils the appearance and it ' s hard to set because there ' s not enough friction in the stem . the slightest movement while holding the watch with the stem pulled out causes the minute hand to move making it hard to get it aligned with the minute marker . plus , for a quartz watch , it slows down about a minute a week . i ' m thinking it is either defective or they are selling factory seconds . 
there is no question about invicta , and the class and appeal they have had for years with their watches . they have definitely been the leading guide in ones who want the finest watches on the market . they have shown that nicely with their timepieces for men for years . this pro diver silver - tone is very easy to fit around the wrist , and tells time nicely . it is a very easy to read watch , and has very good illumination in a blue faced timepiece , with a hint of purple in the light . what i do wish though is that the unidirectional bezel wouldn ' t actually stick at times , when rotating it for elapsed time . nevertheless , it is a great piece for anyone who wants their first step into invicta watches , without spending too much from the wallet . this is a good buy , and well worth the money . price : bsetup & comfort : b - overall : b 1 / 2 - 
this watch is pretty cheap . a little smaller than expected . there is no screw down crown . the bracelet feels well built and as heavy as it should , being stainless . i like the magnifier over the date since it would be hard for me to see it otherwise without glasses . that being said , it looks and feels like a plastic stick on . in fact i may have read where somebody didn ' t like it and peeled it off . taking all this into consideration , it is still a good looking watch that i ' m not afraid of getting wet in the shower . we will have to wait nd see how it holds up . 
for the money , this is a great watch . it ' s a rolex competitor for the every day user . i recommend it . 
i have about 6 invicta watches . they are all excellent quality but , in general , they are huge . i am a big , tall woman , so most womens watches are too small for me , but the mens are too large . this watch has the excellent quality i am use to but the size is perfect , the face about the size of a quarter . i love the strap . it is very comfortable and sometimes i don ' t even realize i ' m wearing it . nothing but praise from me . also , where most invictas have the large , bulky , uncomfortable dial that hurts the wrist , this one has a normal dial . update : i have had this watch for over a year now and it is still my favorite watch . even after all this time i have absolutely nothing negative to say about it . worth every penny . 
sadly , the markers inside the watch , came lose and stopped the watch cold . the invicta company only covers the watch for a year , and it makes no sense to send it back . besides having to keep it wound all the time , my husband stated that the band was very unforgiving and uncomfortable . this is the third invicta watch that i have had , and two of them are now no longer worth what they were paid for . it is very unfortunate because , the invicta watches actually look so nice , but unfortunately , they just don ' t stand the test of time ! ( pun intended ) . however , we also purchased a citizen eco drive watch on the same day , and these watches are phenomenal . they look great , and stand up to daily wearing , without losing time . 
i bought this for my husband for christmas . it was one of three invictas that i purchased . i am very pleased with it , as he was thrilled with it . the quality is excellent . it ' s a very handsome watch for a rugged guy . buy it with confidence ! 
i bought this for my fiancee , who wanted a more " rugged " watch to wear when he ' s out working on our garage expansion construction project , among other things . this watch fit the bill perfectly . the thick rubber band doesn ' t get scratched up , and he says it ' s comfortable when he ' s working . it ' s held up quite well under his punishment . also looks good when he ' s not working quite so hard . would definitely buy again . 
update 6 / 13after thorough constant use and about 50 ocean dives , it still works . i have replaced the band once . it loses about a minute a week , but i can deal with that . great bargain ! * * * original review : picture this : a rolex look , water - resistant for most scuba divers , self - winding , luminous dial , timing bezel , scratch - resistant face , and more . here ' s what the manufacturer says : watch informationbrand name : invictamodel number : 9110part number : inv9110dial window material type : antireflective - mineralclasp : bucklecase material : stainless - steelcase diameter : 41 millimeterscase thickness : 14 millimetersband material : rubberband length : mens - standardband width : 22 millimetersdial color : blackbezel material : black - and - stainless - steelbezel function : unidirectionalcalendar : datemovement : japan - automaticwater resistant depth : 660 feethere ' s what the manufacturer doesn ' t say : 1 . remember that " unidirectional " means one direction . it turns counter - clockwise . after using an electronic watch for many years , i was worried about the bezel getting jammed with sand or salt . there has been no problem . 2 . the stem , screwed in through an " o " ring ( i assume ) to keep it water - tight , will slowly " unscrew " itself over time . check it every so often . 3 . i wear this watch with the face on the bottom of my wrist , and the watchband on the top of my wrist . i thought that i ' d have to accept all the scratches on the face . after 6 months , there is nary a scratch . 4 . the illumination isn ' t as bright as i ' d like , but i ' ve gotten used to it . 5 . i ' ve been happy as a clam ( pun intended ) when diving with it . 6 . the self - winding mechanism works perfectly with my normal arm activities . the only thing i would change is to have the rubber watchband be manufactured with a slight bend in it . i have thinner wrists , so i have an extra 4 . 5 cm section of band sticking straight out , catching on my shirt ( why not cut it off ? i need the extra length if i want to wear it on the outside of a wetsuit ) . highly recommended as a bargain for the discounted price . 
i am very pleased with this made in america waterproof clog . i am a size 71 / 2 so i ordered the size 8 . they were a little large as i expected ; so i just added a cheap insole under the removable footbed in the shoe . voila ! a good fit with a medium thick sock . i bought these clogs so i could have a shoe to slip on when going out in the backyard with my dog . we have very heavy dews and a lot of rain . these work great to keep my feet dry on a & # 34 ; business & # 34 ; tour around the yard . very happy with these and i expect to buy the rain boots as well . 
i wear size - 7 . 5 in a regular shoe and got size - 8 sloggers . my feet are not super wide , but not narrow either . the sloggers are a perfect fit . i have been wearing sloggers for a couple of weeks now . they are very comfortable , and i have been wearing them not only in the garden or washing the car , but when i have to do quick errands in the rain . yesterday , it was pouring and i actually wore them to work , so i was in sloggers for about 12 hours ! i had no problems at all . i was as comfortable in the evening as i was in the morning . my feet were not hot and sweaty despite not taking them off for such a long time . sloggers are a bit heavier than i expected . they are made of rubberized material top and bottom . no openings anywhere , so they are very good for walking in wet grass . surprisingly , my feet do not get too hot despite having no ventilation in the shoe . the sole of the shoe is nicely textured . i am attaching a photo which shows the top and the bottom of the shoe . next to the shoe i positioned a ruler so you can see how high the back of the shoe rises . the back is not totally open , it has a slight rise which help to keep your foot firmly in the shoe . the bottom of the show has some padding , so it provides nice support for the foot and is responsible for very comfortable feeling . and of course they are very easy to put on and take off , which is very handy when your hands are covered with dirt from the garden . the second photo i am attaching to this review shows my foot wearing the shoe , hopefully this gives a better idea of the look and fit than just the shoe by itself . in a close - up you can see a bit of room in the back - the difference between size - 7 . 5 foot and size - 8 shoe . the men a work made fun of the shoes , they thought they were ugly ( what do they know ? ) , but i think they are cute plus very comfortable and functional . 
purchased as garden clogs but very useful as rain shoes , too . sturdily made and comfortable . surprisingly supportive . not as wide as previous purchases and based on other reviews sized up ( i wear a 1 / 2 size ) . for me , they are best worn with socks for better fit . 
i only wish that they were rubber in the inside also so thay can be submerged in muddy waters while gardening . . . but i love them ! ! the green ones are pretty too ! ! 
i thought that i was ordering the same shoes as i had ordered about a year earlier , but sadly that was not the case . these are fine ; they fit well and do the job . however what i thought i was getting was a product with much softer uppers . this is a good thing , i guess , because the shoe offers protection against toe injury , but the comfy ness of the soft uppers is just not there . 
i really like these baby blue color clogs , easy care and quite comfortable to wear , great for rainy days too 
i am totally thrilled with this puchase . . . . i never want to take them off ! they are so comfortable that i have found myself wearing them all the time . they are a smidge too big but that is my fault . . . and they are still wearable and marvelous . now i need to find some everday clogs to wear when not in the garden . 
i like the color . i have a narrow foot but they fit okay . work well in wet grass and on the golf cart 
these are by the back door and i have used them in nice weather , rainy weather and dew - soaked grass and my feet stay nice and dry . very comfortable too ! 
my daughter asked for gardening clogs for her birthday . i found these and she is delighted with them . her word : " perfect " . she says the size 10 is a tiny bit short - her big toe touches the end . but not painfully so . 
very comfortable . i like working in the garden and can simply wash these off with a garden hose . look great for going to the store as well . i normally wear 8 1 / 2 , but this size wasn ' t available so i got a 9 and it fits great , maybe just a little too big . i plan to buy more colors . 
like this garden clog very much . a little narrow , but it stays on your feet even when digging holes , etc . a little heavy for mowing or lots of walking , but overall very pleased with them and a good price as well . 
i do love the sloggers for gardening - they are perfect . i would like to get a pair in black , brown , or olive green . i don ' t love the pastels . 
i got these shoes for my wife for mother ' s day . she is very pleased with the fit and quality of the shoes . she was very pleased that they are made in the usa . she said they looked so nice she hated to get them dirty in the garden . 
i wanted something to wash the car , mow the grass , do outdoor things in . these are just the thing . i ordered larger than i wear because i require an orthotic or nice insert . these do feel a little heavy , but for the jobs and short duration tasks i ' ll be using them for , plus i can just rinse them off . . . . . . . it ' s worth it . i expect these will last years . . . 
these are attractive and so easy to just slip into to go out to do chores around the yards , etc . i keep them by my door and switch into them without bending or doing anything other than to stick my foot into them . i normally wear a 7 . 5 medium shoe , but bought size 8 . with a pair of socks on they are just perfect in fit . without socks , they are fine and comfy too . 
i love the " garden shoe " that i purchased a couple of years ago but they needed replacing due to the fact that they stretched a bit and the footbed has some holes from wear . i purchased the " clog " in the same size but they clearly fit differently than the " shoe . " they are wider and longer . i would not get the clog again . i ' m sorry that i didn ' t stick to what i know and like . 
my best friend recently gave me a pair of the geisha blue clog sloggers in size 8 . i told her i feel like the little dutch girl in my blue shoes . i absolutely love them and am wearing them as i write this . they are extremely comfortable . i also have sloggers boots , which are great for yard work and if i were to get another pair of boots i would choose 1 / 2 size larger for ease of getting on and off , and also another pair of midsummer shoes , which my son calls my hippie shoes because he thinks it looks like a marajuana plant on the front . they are all wonderful , water proof , and attractive . i have an ongoing pink " betty ' s bag " for little presents i find for my best friend and she has a " gwen ' s goodies " bag for me . we may go weeks or even months sometimes without seeing each other so that when we do we always look forward to not only seeing each other but to our treats . these geisha blue sloggers are my best july treat . 
ok , folks . . . both guys and gals who garden do barn chores or are just in and out of town on errands ( well , maybe not your town , but ours here in maine are pretty informal ) these are the most comfy garden clogs ever . this is my second pair and we just received a pair for my husband as well . my old ones i literally wore to " smooth bottoms " . one thing , though , they do run small , so order up a half size at least . ( my husband ordered a men ' s size 12 which fits his 11 shoe size foot perfectly . i ordered women ' s 9 and wear size 8 or 8 . 5 shoes ) they ' re made in the usa . . . . what more could you ask for ? 
sloggers 260kw08 women ' s premium clogs are a fantastic pair of shoes for my feet not only for gardening , but for walking in many conditions . i usually wear a size 7 . 5 shoe , wear a 37 medium in birkenstocks and the size 8 sloggers are very fine for me . i likely could also fit into a 7 , but because i ' d like to wear socks if i desire , i followed the recommendations of others and moved up a size rather than down . another consideration i had when ordering was that when i work , particularly in the summertime , my feet swell , so i sized up . an advantage of these clogs over many others is that their insoles make for a softer , more cushioned feel and they are removable for cleaning or airing out . i find that wearing these requires no socks in the garden , a huge pro for me since my socks become filthy when i wear crocs clogs . the sloggers put the crocs to shame even though they are heavier . i much prefer the feel and appearance of their real sole rather than a self molded one piece shoe . the black sole is a nice contrast , as is the black interior and the bottom of the sole has a lovely swoosh type design in the kiwi color . walking in dirt or mud is not an issue because these shoes can be hosed off . the design of the clogs has a rear which is a bit elevated , so your heel is a little more protected than in other clogs . i ' ve worn birkenstock shoes for many , many years and now that i ' ve discovered sloggers , i have an alternate manufacturer to choose from , and these are made in the usa ! these are great gardening shoes which are nice enough to wear all day inside or out . 
im a clog nut so ordered myself one of these . . was very glad i did . . oh so comfy and i adore the color . . . try one you ' ll like it 
i thought about a boot , but the gardening i do doesn ' t require me to get that deep . even so , i need to keep my feet dry , and already out feeding the birds and checking out the daffodils , i found they are worth their weight . they are heavy , but they claim to slog , not dance , right ? crocs are light but have too many holes . these sloggers are my gardening faves already , and i like the & # 34 ; geisha blue & # 34 ; color . lenore p . 
after cutting my feet and getting a nasty splinter in my foot , i ordered these . omg they are wonderful . very comfy , i want to wear them everywhere . just one thing , i wear a size 8 and ordered a size 9 and they fit great . update 9 - 18 - 11 . . . . what can i say but i still love these shoes and have wore them on errands and such . when gardening i would hose down the inside of the shoes with cold water and it would stop me from getting overly hot and sweaty . love , love , love . . . 
this was a gift for my daughter . she loves them . so handy to slip on to go outside in the dew and rain . 
just got these and tried them on . the color is lovely , the workmanship is fine , however , i walk right out of them , cannot even take a step without them coming off . i tried an insert , no help , socks , no help . they are made to be pretty wide and something about the design makes them not adhere to the foot in such a way that they don ' t slip . btw , the size was correct , i couldn ' t have taken a smaller size as it would have been too short . so , sadly am returning them . as a reference , for me the classic birki ' s clogs fit fine and last forever , so am getting a pair of them in exchange for these . 
i wear these everyday , almost everywhere . i have a garden and horses . easy to keep clean , great fit , and look good enough to go to the store in , too . much better than slip on athletic shoes that get grimy . i have high arches and these don ' t hurt my feet at all . wish they came in more colors ! 
i absolutely love these clogs ! they are so comfortable and easy to clean i wear them daily to walk the animals and do yard work . just hose off and you are ready to go again ! they are the most comfy gardening clog i have ever owned , and i had to come back and get another pair ! i wear them for many other occasions than yard work . like quick trips to the store or walking to the mailbox , etc . the insole is removable , too , with antimicrobial coating . i can ' t recommend these highly enough . 
i wasted a lot of money buying other clogs that looked pretty in the photo with their floral or other type design , but were just not the quality and easy - fitting shoe this one is . because it ' s got a thicker , sturdier upper , you can slip your foot right in without using your fingers . they ' re very comfortable and last a long time . i keep a pair by each door for running outside for the mail or to potty our dogs . they feel so good on my painful feet i walk my dogs or run to the store in them as well . they ' re perfect for warm or cool weather and keep my feet dry and warm in rain and snow . unlike when i wore the clog with the floppy upper my feet don ' t sweat in them and they don ' t look like gardening shoes . love them ! 
these are so comfy and cute . i often put these on when i get home before i water my plants and etc . i can ' t tell you how many times i have forgotten they are still on . great for cooking too ! 
these are exactly what i need when working in the garden . i like the light color because my others were dark blue and would get quite hot when the sun hit them . these don ' t seem to do that . they are getting a little bigger as i wear them . my foot is moving around in them more than i would like . i normally wear between a 7 and 7 1 / 2 but bought an 8 to make sure my heal wasn ' t uncomfortablely hitting the back . 
beautiful ! my daughter loves them ! they fit her just right ! they are perfect in every way , and don ' t look or feel like plastic . they are true to their color in the picture . what a great buy ! 
i love my new garden clogs . they keep my feet dry and are so easy to slip into to run outside , plus they are comfortable . however , i don ' t suggest wearing them on rainy days because your feet will get wet walking through heavily dampened areas . 
just what i needed for gardening . ordered size 7 , and they fit well . good construction , comfortable . highly recommend . great quality for the money . 
this is great for working in yard and garden - keeps mud and sand off my feet and looks good too . very well made , will probably last for years . 
i have been looking for a comfortable gardening shoe that i could just slip on and off easily , and one that would be solid and well - made . this shoe is it ! very comfortable , well - made and i finally feel like i can go out into our damp yard without getting my feet all wet . i can ' t wait to use them all summer in our garden . i did find they run a bit small though . i usually wear a size 9 , but the 9s were too short , so i had to exchange them for a 10 , and they are perfect . if you want to wear these shoes with socks , definitely go for the larger size ! 
great product ! super colors and very fast shipping . don ' t get the insides too wet or the insole moves around and bunches up - that , i did not like . 
i ordered these and got them for a steal from amazon prime . i love having prime because a lot of shoes , sandals , boots on prime come with free shipping and free returns , so you really can ' t go wrong with trying them . i have so many shoes i am going to save these and give them as a gift to my daughter . green is a favorite color too ! i ordered a black pair of slogger rain boots in a seven and they fit her perfectly and she loves them so i know she ' ll like these ! even if she doesn ' t like them they fit me too , worst case scenario is i ' ll have to keep them for myself ! lol . she ' s a maternity nurse so i think she ' ll be able to wear them for work and because they are rubber and have replaceable insoles it won ' t matter if they get slopped up in the delivery room as they are totally washable and so comfortable ! now i can ' t wait for christmas next year ! ! 
got this to protect my husband from the sun while hangin out by the pool . it is very high quality for a reasonable price . he finds it very comfortable and it looks really cute . the neutral color matches just about everything . i would definitely recommend this for anyone spending a lot of time in the sun . 
but he ordered this one and liked it . took it on vacation with us and he says it fits nicely . the draw string holds the hat in place on windy days . plus it kept the sun off his face and neck really good . i was impressed with how the hat looked with the new swim trunks i reviewed earlier and a tank top on him . 
this was ordered for my husband but is unisex . i can ' t see many woman wearing it in this color at least or in the style . it is well made with thick sturdy material . the small logo on the side of it has a butterfly in it as if it was a girls hat . but it is small and not very noticable . it says one size fits most on the tag but inside it says large . it is a little tight on my husband so i am not sure if it is actually a large in womans or if there is ever a size difference in womans and mens hats . but he likes it . i feel the price was worth it . the color was pretty spot on as the one in the pic . it has vent holes which is a plus for my husband with strong spf rating . i didn ' t know hats had spf ratings . can uv rays actually go through hats without spf ? it sounds nice but not sure it matters . it ' s a great hat all around and i feel it will last for quite a while . 
this is a good fitting hat to wear while walking and avoiding those harmful uv rays . i ended up cutting the fabric chin tie and the hat still fits great , even in breezy weather . 
this is a durable hat with good fit and does what it supposed to while remaining washable . you won ' t get many style points with it , but it works . 
i bought this specifically for working in the yard to keep the sun off my head and face . the lightweight material doesn ' t make your head hot but it does a great job at keeping that sun off of me . i ' m thinking of cutting off the strings as they just annoy me , but if you have a lot of wind i can see where they would be nice to have . this hat is soft and comfortable . i have machine washed it once . it held it ' s shape and color very well . 
what i was looking for was a hat that looked good and would afford protection from the sun when doing outside home projects or hiking . liked this one so much i ordered another . 
i ordered two of these . the grey one fits perfect . the brown one is a little big . not sure what ' s going on with the sizing there but overall i like the hats . they work great for me in keeping out the sun to some degree when biking . 
ok , here ' s my criteria for a perfect sun hat : must be cheap . i ' m not paying big money for this . it ' s a hat , it doesn ' t have to be pricey . must be washable . this is something that will get dirty , guaranteed . must be one size fits all . why ? because the standard sizes ( small , med , large , extra large , etc ) just don ' t fit me well . medium is too small , large is too big . must be packable and crushable . so , that ' s why this hat is perfect ! what you don ' t see in the pics is how well it ' s made . the brim is thick , rigid and plenty big enough at 2 3 / 4 inches , the material is of good quality , the stitching and strap looks like it will hold up well . 
this is a great sun hat and the chin tie makes sure it will not fly off your head in wind . it is very comfortable and looks good too . 
i bought this women ' s hat even though i am a man because i have hard time finding a mans hat that is small enough to fit me . this hat is very well made and does an excellent job of keeping the sun of your face and neck . with a little scotch guard it works well in light rain also . like another reviewer mentioned this hat does run small and only the only adjustment is from small to smaller . so if you have a large head this hat probably won ' t work for you . if you have a small head and are looking for a well made hat that does an excellent job protecting your face and neck i highly recommend this one . 
this hat is well made and keeps it shape . it is heavier than others but i guess that is the tradeoff for keeping it ' s shape . i like the chin strap to keep it anchored to your head while kayaking or other outdoor activities . overall a good hat for sun protection . 
my wife is going to use this hat when we vacation in australia . we know it ' s important to wear a wide - brimmed hat to protect from the sun , and this will suit the task perfectly . the fit is good , and it looks like it will be cool due to the ventilation holes , white color and cotton fabric . 
im 5 ' 6 , 150 lbs , with a medium build . i was looking for a 100 % poly shirt for undershirts and these are great . i have purchased other 100 % poly brand t - shirts , to include 5 . 11 tactical , under armor , walmart brands , hanes , champion , and the list goes on . i guess i am picky when it comes to the way a shirt fits but in my opinion , these fit extremely well . other brands were either to short in the sleeves , neck to stretched out , fabric to thin , faded to quickly during washing , or the vertical length was to short , which was a pain if you tuck your shirt in and then when you bend down your shirt comes out . this shirt has a snug neck , not tight , which i like . the sleeve length falls just above the elbow about 1 inch , and the vertical length extends mid crotch level , so if you tuck your shirt in , it should not come out . i was also surprised on the thickness . it is thicker than most 100 % poly sport t - shirts . it also looks good for casual wear as well . this is only based on the black t - shirt . i purchased only one to see how it fits . i would recommend this to others . i plan on buying more . also , for the price and free shipping , it beats or meets other brand prices . 
i was looking for some t - shirts to camp out in , and use in town if i had to . i picked the graphit color to go with black cargo shorts . the color is excellent . i ' m 53 years old , 5 ' 7 & # 34 ; normal build , with a desk job . . and because of that , i have a big gut , so i ordered 2x large . they fit me good , no problems . i still have some room ( some ) . i wanted polyester for the durability of camping , easy clean , and hopefully long lasting . i intend to use these shirts for camping only , but of course would like to look normal if i get stuck going into town . i believe these shirts will do well for me . they fit me good . i washed / dryed them once in the machines and they came out fine ( with static ) . i ' m ok with that . if you want to look great , then probably you ' ll have to look like the male model in the advert . for myself , i only wanted durable , easy clean , and a manly color . i ' m quite happy with the shirts . for me , they suit my purpose . 
good product , very practical , good fit . excellent price / benefits ratio . quick wash and dry / ready to be used again cycle time . have not had it long enough to talk about durability but looks good . 
great shirt for keeping you dry . plus , i love that it is very light when i work up a sweat . you can buy this same shirt at walmart for the same or less , but i wanted to give it a try . it is a great buy and works well . 
these t - shirts are great . the value of these is outstanding for a moisture wicking shirt , true to size and material is not cheap & thin . i would recommend these over your standard cotton t - shirts because they will probably last a lot longer 
i ordered the small . i ' m 5 ' 4 and 117lbs . i wish there was an extra small because i found the shirt a bit baggy in the waist . rather than return it , i took it in on the sides just a bit to make it more fitted . i ' ll keep it , but it ' s just a shirt , nothing special . also , the navy color is kind of blah - not a sharp looking navy , more faded . i ' d go with a brighter color next time , and i ' d remember that i need to alter it to correct the shape of the middle . 
just what i wanted . . . . . . a comfortable , all cotton tee . it seems that they are few & far between these days . the raspberry is a pretty color . 
i love this tshirt . the fit is good . my gripe is the fabric developed a hole ( not near any seams ) after just one wash before i even wore the shirt . i ' ll darn the hole but while i like the bella shirts ( i have a few of them ) , the fabric quality seems to be consistently not up to my reasonable expectations . really , fabric shouldn ' t develop holes from just one wash . 
this is a quality , well - made top that is long in length so will stay tucked in . a true scoop neck ( not a crew neck ) , the rib - knit fabric is soft , comfortable , shapes to your curves , and is not sheer . very flattering garment . i normally wear a size small , but usually order a medium in bella tops ; the exception being that i need a large for their crew - neck , long sleeve baby rib tops . . i have found the bella brand to be top quality . the neck - line stays nice after washing and doesn ' t look rippled like bacon , if you know what i mean . 
i ' m always a medium and ordered the large . they fit perfect across chest and shoulders . it ' s too long and will have to be hemmed but that ' s the case with every shirt i buy , even with a medium . nice little scoop to go with anything . 
nice shape , a little too small , especially after a few washes . fabric is okay , not super fine , but not trashy either . no show - thru . 
it fit as expected but the shirt tends to stretch out of shape when wearing . i thought i would try a shirt that is 100 % cotton but this one needs a little spandex in it to help hold the shape . i will keep it and continue to wear it though . 
this shirt is a glorious color , it ' s beautiful . as to the quality , it ' s thicker than many other t - shirts and not quite as form fitting . although i like the thin , form - fitting type , this is very comfortable and i find myself wearing it a lot and have ordered more in different colors . the quality is great . love the neckline as well . 
i like this t - shirt because it is light weight for the summer months . it seems to run a little small compared to my other & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; t - shirts . 
runs a little small , light colors are a little see through - - just wear a nude bra underneath - - but fabric is a nice medium weight . not paper thin and flimsy as seems to be the prevailing trend . length has changed however . i ordered one in april and it fell just at hips - perfect - then it got ruined from a pen in the wash , so i ordered another one about a month later and it was well below hip level . that may be a plus for some people , but i liked it better the other way . 
fits perfect , love the colors , does not shrink . i will be buying more of these as they are a great tee for a great price . 
these are really nice shirts . a little heavier than most t shirts ( tight knit ) , they are richer looking than your standard t shirts . only drawback is they are not 100 % cotton . i live in the tropics and always buy all cotton . my mistake , or maybe they did not list the fibers . if they do not list the fibers they really should . with all that said these are keepers , i use them in an air conditioned office . colors are true to pictures . sizing is accurate to a little on the larger size rather than smaller side . buy all the colors available , in tank or this scooped neckline you will be happy with them . 
a nice , plain shirt for daily wear but the color is not much different than e plum one i got 
sleeves are extra short , goes up under the armpit , it ' s a great fit though . i usually wear a large but bought the xl for a baggier fit ; i couldn ' t be happier with the fit , or shirt in general . love bella shirts ! ! 
if you ' re modest , you might want to wear something underneath this t . i definitely like the ones i got , but was surprised @ how sheer they actually are . 
very comfortable t - shirt . long length is great to wear under other t - shirts . washes great , no shrinking in the dryer . soft , cotton . highly recommend ! 
the fabric is thin , but i ordered it in black color there isn ' t an issue with transparency . since other customers commented that it runs small i ordered one size up . i usually wear small in tops so i ordered the medium and i ' m glad i did . it fits perfect and the length is good too . the fabric is soft and has the perfect amount of stretchiness . i will be ordering more colors . 
great fit with deep v neck and little cap sleeve . great with a skirt or capris . should be worn with a tank underneath . 
2 problems with this costume . 1 . the mess in one of the eye openings in the mask was not attached . had to get the hot glue gun out and do some repairs . 2 . the sash that came with it is only 26 & # 34 ; long . fortunately my grandson is slim but we didn ' t have much sash to work with . i think he will wear the costume without it . i guess for $ 11 you can ' t expect much . 
it is fun for my grandson , he is 5 , but enough tall and size 4 - 6 looks short on him . the axe is not included . he costume is well made . 
this is the perfect costume . so happy with my order . this will make for a great halloween costume . will definitely order from them again next year . 
looked high and low for this costume for my grandson . was lucky when i found it here at such a reasonable price and when it arrived at my grandson ' s house in time for halloween i was very happy . 
my daughter is looking forward to wearing this costume for halloween . the mask is quite scary . she especially loves the gloves . the length is perfect . happy halloween to all ! 
i purchased this after christmas so i know that i got a great deal on it , but if you are paying more than $ 5 for it , you are wasting your money . the fabric is very thin and cheap . if you were to spend 25 , i ' d say spend 40 and get it directly from disney where it ' s actually a much heavier robe . 
our son and nephews love this robe . it ' s not made to last for years of intense use but i anticipate it ' ll last long enough . the threads seem to come loose in a few places , but for an inexpensive price its a great children ' s play robe . there is no tie on the top of the robe as shown in photo . 
went perfectly with the jedi costume i bought for my 8 year old son . it helped to complete the costume . 
i paid under $ 5 for this item , and am happy with what i received for $ 5 . i expected that i would not get what was pictured , and i , in fact , did not ( like everyone else ) . the robe i received does not tie in the front as shown . if you view the same robe in medium , that robe did tie in the front . for $ 5 it is worth it . . . for much more , i would not waste your money . 
our two older campers were jedi ' s & # 34 ; in training & # 34 ; during this past summer ' s session of camp . they loved & # 34 ; looking & # 34 ; the part ! 
our son looked great . well made , looks like who you are supposed to be , and is still being played with . 
i have ordered these before and like them very much opposed to the shear ones that never seem to fit right or feel right . the fishnets have a lot of give and are very comfortable . 
these hose are great , easy access , comfy , feel great and very sexy even on us big girls give them a try ladys 
its elastic and stretchy . i found it comfy . i will get a few more from this brand now that i now it fits perfectly 
lol i bought 3 different pairs of crotchless fishnets ( one size ) and none of them fit and i ' m only 10 pounds over the recommended weight . so i decided to buy the plus size and they stretch really well . they go back to their original shape when you take them off . they are a little big on me ( by length ) but i ' m able to make due lol . i highly recommend these . even if you weigh 300lbs i know you can wear these . 
very nice . at least i think they were . i ordered so many pairs in different brands , but i love them all . so does he ! 
my boyfriend loved these , but they ' re more fun to look at than to wear . the sizing is right , it ' s just that they stretch out too much and don ' t bounce back . i was hoping for springier netting that recoiled to shape . the feet and legs have a tendency to stretch out too big , and then not bounce back . they will if you wash them after wear , but will also stretch out really big again , too . also , the netting fabric is pretty fragile . . . snags and tears easliy , and gets frayed and fuzzy after a couple of wearings . i love the look , style , and initial fit . . . but after you wear them 2 or 3 times they just aren ' t the same . you almost have to throw them out and get a new pair . i have a pair of dancer ' s fishnet panty hose that are very springy , and i ' ve been able to wear those over and over with no damage or sagginess afterward . these are just made out of too cheap of a material for long - term wear . 
great price and my wife loves them ! who are we kidding ? i love the too ! why pay 3x as much in a store ? 
this wallet is bigger than i originally thought it was , but it is well constructed and i am glad i purchased it . if it had a chain , it could be a small purse ! 
i love this hobo wallet . the leather is beautiful and soft . the compartments are large and it holds alot . beautiful workmanship . awesome . 
i know this is really late for a review , but it should still be helpful . i bought this for my wife two years ago as a christmas gift . she was always dropping hints about wanting one . well two years have come and gone and she is still using this wallet daily and it looks just like it did the day we got it . don ' t waste your money on cheap imitations . like the saying goes , you get what you pay for . i would highly recommend this 
to be honest , i wanted to buy an ordinary wallet , get this stuff when i was very surprised , it looks big , can be used as a hand wrapped . color is very positive , very beautiful . the leather feels very strange , especially soft , a little do the old style 
hobo , you really don ' t have to say more than that , but i will ! hobo is top quality , the leather is beautiful , it comes packed in tissue with stuffing and foam , etc . the hardware is really nice and the leather is sewn in perfect so it should last a very long time . the zipper in the center is a compartment almost the size of the wallet when you lay it open . you wouldn ' t want to put anything too bulky in there but you could slip in extra cash or credit card , passport , even your phone . my phone ( evo 4g ) fits nicely in one side , if i want to use this as a clutch , i still have room for lipstick or pen , etc . one side is all pocket and has a zipper pocket on the inside , this side would be good for the accessories you usually carry in your purse . the other side has 6 credit card slots and two long slots like for cash . there are also a few slots in the center lay out for frequently used cards or gift cards , etc . i don ' t think you ' d have to worry about any cards falling out of the slots in this area . there are magnets that hold the two sides together and they are pretty strong - - again top quality . the ends are open but not gaping , so you may want to judge how valuable the cards you choose to put in this center section until you see how it works for you . i bought the black leather for about $ 60 . the colors range widely in price , but i will probably check back periodically to see if some other colors i like get to a better price , because if you had few of these , they would probably last you the rest of your life ! this wallet is big enough that once you have it filled with your items , you can just change purses and drop this wallet in and be ready to go . very lovely , i can ' t imagine anyone being disappointed with this wallet . and if you are not , i suggest you return it - - hobo deserves a chance to make it right and doesn ' t deserve a bad wrap . enjoy ! 
i give my daughter a hobo wallet each year for christmas . she switches back and forth between the colors . but she loves this style wallet . we always seem to go back to the lauren vintage style . it is such good quality and the room you have for everything . . . wow ! she likes it because it has several different compartments and the magnetic part holds the wallet & # 34 ; together & # 34 ; very nicely where it is not falling open like some wallets do . it has two top compartments you open to put your change , credit cards , bills , etc . . . then you have other areas to place several other items as well . the black color is very rich and classy . love this wallet ! 
this is my second hobo in the lauren style . my first one lasted for about 4 years before it started to look too worn . and this one is sooooo bright and cute . i get so many compliments on it . makes me happy whenever i need to pull it out . i plop it in my tote bag and use it as a wallet , but it ' s great as a clutch on its own . 
this past december my wallet was stolen , and i ' ve been on the hunt for a suitable replacement ever since . . . i am super picky about wallets , going through at least five the last time i was in the market , i was continually dissatisfied , until i found the perfect wallet ( the one that was stolen ! ) . since i wasn ' t able to track down the exact version of my stolen wallet , i went on a search , scouring every store ' s inventory , only to be totally disappointed at the selection . after searching for a few months , i found this wallet online , and it looked like it might fit the bill . i ' ve bought other wallets online , and been very disappointed , so i sat on it for a week or so , trying to find something local that i could see and touch in person . . . but i finally submitted my order , received this wallet , and i ' m so happy i did ! ! i purchased the violet wallet , and the color is very pretty ( true to the color pictured ) . my wallet doesn ' t appear to have & # 34 ; scratches & # 34 ; as some other posters have indicated , however , there is a very weird smell to to the leather . i don ' t care for the smell , but i can ' t send it back because it ' s perfect in every other way . i have spritzed a hanky with my favorite perfume , and tucked it in the large pocket . . . hopefully that will chase away the weird smell . ( it ' s kind of a plastic - chemical smell , belch ! ) - - i should add , i ' m rather smell sensitive , so this might not be a problem for most people . the clasps are super easy to open / close and they form a tight seal so nothing slips out . i use the side with the zippered pocket for dollars and cents , and the other side for business cards , credit cards , etc . and i love that i also have the large zipper pocket to store my phone , lipstick , car key , etc . if i want to go without a purse . i feel like the metal is very sturdily attached to the leather . i haven ' t tugged or pulled on it , but i did inspect it closely when i received it due to some negative feedback about a problem of the metal separating from the leather . . . seems super sturdy and well made to me . the magnet is really strong , so it just closes easily , and remains closed . the fold is perfect , as one side is higher than the other , and it automatically closes like that each time . i like it because i ' m already used to the higher / lower sides , and know which holds money , and which holds cards . i really love this wallet . . . thanks so much for a great product ! 
i would lose my phone , i would lose my keys , i would lose my cards . my purse was always messy . then i got this beautiful gorgeous thing . it ' s great quality material , great make and design . it even smells good . should you get it ? ? ? yes best wallet ever . trust me . . . i ' ve bought alot of wallets and none are as stylish and as practical as this guy . 
this is just what i was looking for . i ' ve wanted one for a few years now and the kelly green is great ! it has room for my cc ' s inside and license and most used card as you open the clutch . i am smitten and love this thing ! : ) 
this wallet is such good quality . it ' s very nicely built . the color is more purple than in the picture . it is also larger than i thought it would be . 
after being a vb fan for years . . . this wallet is not only very beautiful , but extremely durable . the convenience of the pockets , nook and crannies to be extraordinary . 
i ' ve had this for a few months now and no problems . . . a few reviews stated the seam started to come apart but i think this is due to overloading the pockets . . . i don ' t put my phone in the pocket and that helps . . . i love the look of the leather and the lining and it fits everything ! tons of room and sometimes i use this just as a clutch . . . highly recommended ! 
the honey ombre color looks even better in person . it ' s on the larger side for a wallet , but everything has a place and it ' s easy to keep organized . 
this is my second wallet purchase of this type - the first one lasted 4 years . i use it as a wallet inside my purse and have found it to be top notch and holds the things that i need . the double latch is great as i store checkbook and other in that area , then cards and money in the other . . i will by this product again and again as it really fits the most basic wallet need for me . 
i have had my lauren wallet ( embossed floral / dark red ) for over 10 years . it still looks amazing and it is my only wallet . it takes a beating , holds all my stuff without popping open , and i get compliments on it constantly . doesn ' t get better . 
wow ! it only react all the surrounding this purse ! i love the large and high - quality purses , but this purse has exceeded all my expectations ! ! ! recommend to everyone ! 
i bought the black patent wallet . it is exactly what i wanted and cheaper than our local boutique . it is a well organized clutch / wallet . i have enough rooms for all my cards , checkbook , my cell , car keys , sunglasses and the best part is my cash is easy to get to and i don ' t have to fold it ! it is well made and i love it . my teen girls are fighting over which one of them get it when i am done with it . = ) 
i love this wallet ! it ' s great quality leather , the clasps keep everything together and it ' s so functional ! i love the raspberry color of the leather , and i get compliments every time i pull it out . this is my third hobo wallet and i liked that small scratches were less noticeable in this color . 
first the pros : lots of pockets and little areas to place your things . pretty color choices ( i got violet , which wasn ' t as loud as i was expecting ) . nice interior fabric . the cons : the leather didn ' t seem to be of really high quality . i mean , it wasn ' t bad or anything , but i ' ve dealt with leather goods in all incarnations , and this just didn ' t come off as being high quality . and ( purely subjective ) , i just couldn ' t get excited about the style . maybe it was the color i chose . maybe i should have gone with black or the stone , but this wallet came off as very old fashioned . i ' m not really into vintage , and the videos of these wallet ' s that i ' d seen online had seemed so fashionable , but that feeling didn ' t materialize when the package did . i think i ' ll stick with my patent zip - around . 
i was surprised with this wallet \ t as much as i was surprised withalicia klein wallet " park avenue " . i was worried about the color scheme , but it does seem to work . it does everything you should expect from a wallet , and i highly recommend getting it . 
amazon has the wrong shoe photo on the description - that shoe is the penny loves kenny shoe ( or something like that ) . the real shoe is classy and good looking . i bought black and antique ( red ) in size 12 . they look great ! however , i have trouble keeping them on my feet when taking the stairs . they have slipped right off my foot and then i step on the back ridge of the shoe and it really hurts me . i have hyper - sensitive feet and anything that i " step " on feels like sharp rocks - so when the shoe falls off and i step on the shoes ridgid back - i cringe in pain . i am glad no one saw me - you ' d think i had been stabbed or something . i decided to take the long way and use the elevator so this would not happen again . . . while in the elevator several women commented on how comfortable and nice they looked . i just said thank you . . . rather than tell them the real truth about how not comfortable they had been . they are okay for comfort unless of course they slip off foot . 
i used to have a pair of naturalizer mules like this , the previous model . i wore them until they basically fell apart and was hoping that this pair would replace them . these are beautiful shoes that seem really comfy , but unfortunately i had to return them because they are not as wide as the previous model and thus were too narrow for my foot . if you have a narrow foot , these make a great buy . 
i love this shoe . i have it in several colors . it comes in my exact size which is very narrow . fits my foot like a glove . very comfortable and soft feeling on the foot . also getting hard to find . was so happy when i found it on amazon . thank you . 
these shoes are very well made and the suede is nice , as well . i have freaky feet and they just were not comfortable . i felt like they made me shorter than i actually am . hahaha ! 
this is the first time i have bought naturalizer shoes , and i love everything about them great fit , and the comfort is beyond my expectations . i have wide problem feet and it is hard to fine shoes . i have been able to wear these all day long and not hurt . for me that is a big deal . will most likely buy again . 
these shoes fit well , and i can walk all day in them . i would order more and highly recommend them . 
love these shoes and also got them in red . they are very comfortable and look nicer than the average ' sport ' sandal . 
these shoes can be worn with smart casual clothing , or with every day shorts and t - shirt . jambu shoes are great ! 
these sandals give good support to my feet and are comfortable to wear when walking around all day . wore them recently on a vacation to disney world , a lot of walking , and my feet felt fine at the end of the day . 
have been a keen fan for years but after reading the reviews on these , decided to try them . they are much lighter in weight than my similar pair of keens . love that . they gray color is good for an everyday shoe but i did not like it on me . even with the box toe style , size runs about half size too small so i returned and reordered a 1 / 2 size larger and a different color . the replacement pair arrived quickly . color was not exactly as it appeared on the monitor , but i really like it . have not worn them for any length of time yet but out of the box they are very comfortable . update : love these sandals . very comfortable for long time wear and lots of walking . 
wore these shopping all day . feet were comfortable . i usually wear 9 1 / 2 and these fit true to size . they ran a little wide ( i have medium width feet ) , but the strap helps to keep them in place . 
this chain sparkles in the light , just as a great diamond cut should . it also is a nice thickness and feels sturdy . as someone who routinely breaks necklaces , this is a definite plus ! i wear the chain 24 / 7 and have worn it for approximately one week now ( yes , i have actually broken chains in this timeframe ) and lo and behold : it ' s still together and , not only that , but it hasn ' t lost its beautiful shine . 
got 2 of these to wear and love them , really shiny and nice . good hooks and work just as i wanted them to . 
this item was smaller than expected and the error was on my part . the seller was nice enough to email me and show me a larger chain that would best suit me . i gave this smaller one to a female friend of mine = ) thank you dahlia for your quick response 
i had a heavy cross that needed a thick rope chain to hold it . i found exactly what i wanted and delivery was quick . 
great chain of high - quality silver . a little thinner than i expected . i think a good gift for relatives or friends , but leave yourself . 
i received these for mother ' s day and love them . they are nicely made and have the right amount of dangle to be feminine and fun . the pearls have a nice luster and are smooth . the silver is shiny and well matched to the pearls . i would highly recommend these cute earrings . i wore them with jeans on the first day and got tons of compliments . 
my husband surprised me with these earrings . i love them . i ' ve gotten so many compliments on them that i ' m thinking on getting the peach ones too . i love black pearls , and these just look gorgeous . the value is great and you won ' t be disappointed . they look at least as good as in the picture . 
i love the peach pink cultured pearl silver bunch earrings . they are the perfect match for my necklace and i am very happy with them . they came in an attractive jewelry box and were delivered earlier than estimated . 
i purchased these for my mom for christmas . they really are pretty . they lay and move very nicely and are a good length for dangly earrings . big enough to be noticed but not so long as to be gaudy . 
these really look very beautiful ! i was afraid they might look too big or heavy , but they are just perfect - - very delicate ! 
i have narrow feet and it ' s hard to find shoes that fit well . these fit wonderfully throughout the toe box and the arch , but the heel will take some breaking in as it is painful currently 
i just wore these for the first time today and i love them . i am on my feet all day at work and they feel great . they feel like sneakers . 
i liked these shoes but they just felt a little snug in the width . i had to return them . i could ' ve exchanged this for a larger size but i bought these with another pair of shoes ( skechers go walk 2 - stance ) and the skechers were more comfy . 
do like this shoe but wish it was not a & # 34 ; tie & # 34 ; shoe . love the other sketchers that you can just slip on . but the fit is good and very comfortable . 
these fit perfect ; which is saying something with my feet ! just enough room in the toe box ; and not sloppy at the heel . they are a bit more ' substantial ' than some other models of skechers ! look nice on ; just enough cushion . i don ' t think i would wear them for an entire day of walking ; but still comfortable and well made ! 
these shoes are cute except when i went to put them on the right shoe was a little smaller than the left and felt uncomfortable . hence , i had to return . 
these are warm and treaded , making them good winter choices - - especially for the woman who is in and out a lot and can ' t be bothered to get into and out of boots . the downside here is the stiffness of the sole , which is sturdy . however , many boots are just as bad . the sweater knit exterior pairs well with jeans or other casual , outfits and , on a dry winter day , the clogs come right inside and carry on . no tiresome changing . 
i have kidney failur which had effect my walking ibought my first pair from shoe . com had it for 4 years 2010 until i replace them with the 5 pairs i bought from amazon 
i was very excited to buy these . . . . i pretty much wear crocs or uggs . my friend has a pair and loves them . i am on my feet most of the day and up and down stairs . these run very narrow and a really heavy . i am trying to give these a fair amount of time to see if they work out . order a size up as they run small . 
too big for me but loved them . i sold them to my girl friend and she can ' t wait for winter to come to wear them . 
of this clog . . i would love to see more colors , but i love the way they look with jeans and they are very warm . . 
i love this shoe its great for running around and trying to be comfortable at the same time . the bottom is very heavy and quite thick but still cute . 
the only ( slight ) disappointment with this shoe is the color . in the picture it ' s reddish - brown ; in person , i would consider it a dark tan or a light brown . still , the color wasn ' t a deal breaker . i have trouble finding a comfortable shoe and this shoe is very comfortable to me . i had a couple of concerns because of the comments , 1 . i was concerned that it might be too heavy , but it ' s not any heavier than some of my tennis shoes , 2 . i was concerned that i would have to go up 1 / 2 size because of the fur lining . i wear a 7 1 / 2 and the shoes fit perfectly . the tread is great for snow , not deep snow , obviously , but good traction on light snow . 
i really did like these , but they turned out to be not exactly what i am looking for . if they came up higher in the back ( basically if they weren ' t a clog ) it would be more what i am looking for - have a specific intent , not a just because type purchase . if i had the money to keep them i would ' ve and just bought something else too . i only wore them around the house to check fit and comfort - i found them to be comfortable and fit perfect ( i ' m a solid size 6 , ordered a size 6 ) for the short time i had them on . i love the fuzz and the smooth suede ( or suede - like ) material . again , wish i didn ' t have to return them . may repurchase in the future . 
i have a similar pair of these ( also skecher ' s ) in brown , they don ' t match everything so had to get another in black . these are awesome , especially for anyone who wants something quick to put on to run out in the snow or semi wet weather , as they have a nice durable non slip / skid sole . . i personally hate having to put on a bulky boot if i don ' t really have to ( like taking the dog out for a couple of minutes ) . they are true to size , might be stiff at first but take the shape of your foot very quick . nice with a thin sock or none for a quick on off . 
i purchased these for my sister - in - law per her request . she loves them and says they are extremely comfortable right out of the box 
i had these slippers before for about 5 years , and they were virtually indestructible until i got an 18 month old labrador retriever . even she couldn ' t really tear them up , but i had to buy a new pair . they are so cute , look great with yoga pants , and are warm and comfortable . i will have these for years to come because the dog is forbidden to touch them ! 
hi i buy a lot of things on here . i will tell you this pair ofsketchers are the best i have . i ordered a pair in black also and there so confy , ithey look great with jeans and very nice on . please but them . i wear a 8 ordered a 9love them kay they came on time and packaged good . 
i am furious ! ! i can ' t even get a hold of a live person to take care of this matter ! i am totally pist off . i am so tired of being ripped off ! i want my money credited back to my account . i did what i was supposed to do , now it ' s your turn ! ! 
i was not impress with these shoes , the are hot due to the fur , and they are not true to size . 
this was a great deal on amazon as far as price and quality of item . the shoes do run a little small so i would recommend you order a size larger then you normally take . i ordered the regular size i take and they were a little too small but amazon having a great return policy was quick to send a return label and sent out a new pair in larger size . i loved these shoes and actually ordered a couple pair . you won ' t be disappointed ! ! 
i ' ve tried these on and walked around the house in them - it ' s not cold enough yet to wear them but i iove how they feel on and they don ' t feel as high as they look when walking in them . love them ! 
i bought this as a slipper but it can be worn as a shoe . it does run true to size . unfortunately for me they don ' t have wide in my size . 
i first wore these in 2008 when i had a bad back . i was happy to find them again here . the tire tread soles are great shock absorbers for a sensitive neck and back . the shoes are heavy but you get used to them after a few days . 
first of all , there is zero flexibility when walking . secondly , they are too heavy to not have flexibility . finally , there is zero cushioning . i can ' t see what anyone likes about this shoe except its looks ( which is why i gave it 2 stars ) . i would definitely buy this shoe in the future if skechers made them more comfortable and flexible . i hope to see this change as i really think they are cute . please , skechers ! improve this product ! 
my wife buys at least one pair of these every year and has to buy another pair before the first ones wear out . she absolutely loves them , especially during the winter time . we often have snow and the lift on the sole is enough that normally she can slip them on and go out in the weather without worrying about getting her feet wet . plus she says they are the most comfortable footwear ever ! 
love the shoe however u need to buy 1 size larger than u normally wear to fit u correctly . disappointed now have to return n wait for refund n then repurchase in a larger size . 
love these shoes . they are very warm . . . . i wear them without socks ! they are comfortable and sturdy on slippery pavements . i would recommend these if you are looking for something more than a shoe but less than a boot for the winter . 
i really like these shoes . they ' re easy on & off while going outside to get the dogs , mail , etc . they are warm & very comfy ! 
as other ' s have mentioned the fit is a little narrow at first , but keep in mind , the uppers will stretch out with wearing , so i planned accordingly . ( i ' m normally a size 9 because i have wide feet , even though my length is an 8 . 5 fit . so i ordered the 8 . 5 knowing the uppers will stretch . a 9 would have been too big . ) i wore them without socks my first day . no blisters or ouchy spots after being in them all day . fake fur is soft and warm . the sole is very heavy and clunky , which i was expecting , but make sure you know these are not delicate slipper - like shoes before ordering - they are very thick and sturdy . good traction on the soles . 
i bought these on the 26th and they arrived on the 30th ( fast delivery ) . i am so pleased with them and they are a great color . i bought an 8 . 5 m and they are a great fit . nice thick sole and i am hoping they really last . thank you skechers ! 
these shoes fit well , a little tight at first because of the lining , but quickly conforms to your foot . love that they are so nice and warm , no socks needed ! just wore them shopping , right out of the box , and came home with no blisters or other problems . first time in a long time that i ' ve been able to do that ! the soles are very thick but the shoe doesn ' t feel heavy while wearing them . they seem very well made and i expect them to hold up for several years . 
these were exactly as i was expecting - nice suede shoes , thick soles , fuzzy and warm on the inside . they are very comfortable and look really nice . i wear them all the time . i love the fact that they are winter shoes that i can just slip on without any fuss with laces and such . i couldn ' t be happier . 
i was looking for a shoe that would take me from inside to outside . this is perfect for me ! great fashionable shoe ! 
i have very wide feet and wasn ' t sure about the length and width of these shoes . i ordered my size and a size bigger and to my surprise my size was roomy enough . my heels cover the trim a little but the trim crushes down and it isn ' t a bother to walk on . after wearing them twice i ' ve noticed they have given already so that ' s even better . i chose chestnut because i thought they would be more practical and the color is beautiful . i gave it three stars because i think the fur trim is too fluffy and the weight of the shoe makes them a little difficult to keep on while walking . i don ' t hate the trim but i ' m glad that most of my pants cover that part and i think thicker socks could solve the sliding problem . overall , they ' re nice looking , warm and will help me get through the rest of my pregnancy without having to put big boots on my swollen feet this winter . update : i wore these shoes for one winter season and ended up getting rid of them . they gave so much in width that the only way they would stay on my feet was if i walked like a snail . my ankle turned a few times , once resulting in a pretty bad fall . wearing them without socks helped to prevent the shoe from sliding off a little but not much . if you size down , they ' ll be too short so i think that either way , these shoes just stretch out way too much . they were cute and i received many compliments but very heavy and clunky . i believe the sole is just too much . i had to get rid of them because they were hazardous to my health . 
i generally love skechers sandals ; i have a pair from 3 years ago that are still one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes i own . it ' s a shame that they don ' t sell them anymore . in fact , skechers seems to be focusing on flip flops which are terrible for your feet . i was hoping these sandals would be comfortable , but they aren ' t at all . there is no support near the ball of the foot . i think these would be okay for running errands or for bicycling , but not for hiking / walking . 
i usually take a 7 . these are so huge . i ' ve ordered 2 pair ( 1 / 2 and whole size ) smaller , hoping they arrive in time for my trip . i wonder if this is true of all sketchers , as i see other styles i ' d like . these look good , and i think they will be both versatile and comfy , hence the 3 stars . but if i cannot wear them , they ' re not getting more stars . so here i am , back weeks later , to say that the full size down was the pair that worked out for me . but they were fantastic on the trip , which involved a lot of walking on uneven terrain and cobbled streets ! i have added another star , but not to five , so others will pay attention to the size difficulty . 
could have done with a bit more padding on the heel for extra comfort other than that , good walking shoe 
i purchased a 6 . 5m . the shoes fit perfect and are very comfortable . i wear them with shorts , capris , and jeans . i love this shoe . this is the second pair i have owned . during summer vacations when i know there will be a lot of walking my feet are happy i am wearing these . 
i went up half a size from other reviewers advice and i would have been fine with my regular size . still very comfortable and roomier might be better with these . i owned a pair of these before and they were a bit tight and made my feet swell , so this may be an improvement on the last pair . 
i really like these shoes . i ' m taking them on vacation and plan to wear them alot . i do agree that they run just a bit large without sox , but i don ' t know if a half size smaller would have been too small so i ' m keeping them . i ' ve been wearing them a lot and they are pretty comfy . would like to try on a half size smaller only to check the fit . i looked at some other well known brands styled like this one , but they were twice the price . would definitely buy again . 
i have been looking for a sport / water sandal for months and thought i had finally found one in this skechers model . though they run larger than i expected i thought i could just adjust the bungee cord , but that the bungee cord shown on the shoe is for looks only ! these are very cute and felt as if they would be comfortable . i cannot however speak to how long they would last . 
i had a pair just like this and loved them , so i ordered another pair when mine wore out . sadly , the sole in the right shoe is glued in crooked , which throws my gait off . there is no way to remove it in order to glue it in straight without tearing it all apart . i had already thrown the box away , so i can ' t send them back . 
i have purchased several of these over the years , still my favorite water shoes , very comfy and last pretty long time 
after having these as long as i have , i got 2 pairs expecting something more . they are not as comfortable & the elastic over the ball of the shoe doesn ' t have much give . 
these sandals were too loose in the instep even though i chose a half size smaller than i usual . they are a nice looking shoe , comfortable and would probably fit someone with a high instep . wished they had worked as i was looking forward to wearing them on vacation . 
this is my 3rd pair of skechers sandals . the first pair disappeared with my lost luggage on a trip to italy last year . i was so upset , since they were my favorite " casual " shoes . the 2nd pair i still use ; but they are size 7 1 / 2 and just a bit too short for my toes ( the original pair were open - toed ) . i only use them now when i am kayaking , since i don ' t mind if they get wet . for the latest pair , i went up a 1 / 2 size and the fit is perfect . they have great arch support , which is important to me since i ' ve had plantar faciitis in the past . they are also very comfortable - i usually wear them on my days off when i ' m running around . i ' ve worn them with jeans , capris and even skirts , and i ' ve gotten alot of compliments on them . i live in florida , and find that they are much cooler than a sneaker ; in fact , i think the skecher sandals are even more comfortable than their sneakers . i would definitely recommend them . 
i recommend this sandal for it is very comfortable and cute . . . you slide into these . they are so nice that i am on my second pair . . i wash mine if needed and sun dry . i call them my walking shoes for summer . no complaints of sore feet . they have lasted over two summers . great shoe . 
i like them , but they gave me blisters the first day . i have short toes and i ' m guessing that the binding meets right where my large toe cuticle meets the fabric . i ' m going to put a cotton ball with bandage on my toe the next time i walk . for me skechers shoes have never let me down on the comfort side . unfortunately , i have to say that this shoe did let me down . 
got these as a present , they were bought from amazon . look - wise , exactly as the picture shows . they come up to about mid - calf and look okay with skinny jeans tucked in or leggings . the bad - size runs big , get 1 / 2 size smaller . i normally wear an 8 , but these are about 1 / 2 size to big . the inner boot is not lined , only the shaft is . on a cold day , you would need to wear some thick socks - maybe that ' s where the 1 / 2 size extra room would come into play . foot bed is not very comfortable , might as well be walking on a wood sole . the top of the boot is floppy . even all the way laced , zipped , and buckled ( actually velcro but will come back to that ) the boot is floppy . there is a small , very slender , " buckle " that is actually velcro . it does not do anything but be annoying since the area underneath bulges if you velcro too tight , and the side of the boot is floppy if too loose . overall , the boot is just okay . not my favorite and won ' t be wearing it a whole lot . moot point since i bought them for cold , snowy winters , and the foot of the boot is not warm but actually quite thin . 
i love them . i wear a 9 & saw they only had an 8 . 5 , but ordered any way & couldn ' t believe it - - they fit ! i am very happy with them ! want a black pair , too ! great buy . some say they don ' t do great in the cold , but they aren ' t snow boots . they work great for me , only look a little different then picture , but i still adore them . was iffy about buying boots online - - but this purchase was worth it . love the chocolate brown pair that i got . i live around ga & they are wonderful & keep my feet toasty - - all you ' d need was so e snow covers for boots if u were in the snow & you ' d be fine . would recommend : ) . 
i walk daily in cold wisconsin weather . these boots are warm and comfortable ~ also i found that i am not slipping and sliding like i did in my old boots because they have very good traction ! ! 
good boots . i bought them mainly to keep from wiping out on snow / ice and embarrassing myself . so far so good - - the traction seems great . i ' m not out trekking through snow for long periods of time , so i can ' t testify to how warm they ' d be in extreme conditions , but for my purposes they ' ve been perfect - - kept my feet warm but didn ' t make them sweat or anything . i see what others mean about the tops , but i just wrap the laces once around the back before tying and have had zero problems with snow getting in . i ' m usually between a size 10 and 11 ( the shoes in my closet are about half and half ) . i got the 11 and still have plenty of room left for thick socks , so these seem true to size . very comfortable , and pretty cute for something so functional . my only complaint is that there ' s a significant difference between the color of the fur on the left vs . the right boot ( the fur is a mix of black and white - - one boot has lots more black , the other lots more white ) . i ' m guessing i just got a weird pair , as i hadn ' t seen that mentioned in any other reviews ( although let me know if you have the same problem in your size 11s - - maybe we can trade one boot haha ) . i noticed it right off but didn ' t think it ' d bother me enough to justify sending them back . maybe i should ' ve though , since i think about it every single time i put them on . i ' ll ding them one star for that - - otherwise wonderful . 
i love love love these boots , they are so comfortable , and cute . the picture truly does not do them justice . : ) i am very pleased with these . 
i really like these boots , they are perfect for cold weather . i like the option of the two laces . only issue i have is with the zipper , i wish it went all the way up , however i ' m assuming its that way to adjust to any size calf . other than that it ' s just what i was looking for : ) 
returned boots . not quite what i expected . i did not care for lacing boot up . although , the boot was quite comfortable . 
these boots fit to size . i wear a size 9 and that is what i ordered . there is actually additional to room for heavy socks . you do not have to tie laces but use the side zipper & velcro wrap around to remove and put on . they are also very attractive & fashionable . i tried them on ice and snow where the traction was not only great but they kept my feet warm and dry . 
i am returning these boots . they fit well and are made well , but i do not like the top where the zipper ends . there are still several inches of boot to go , and it is held together by a little strap . since i planned to wear these over skinny jeans , it just looks funny where it doesn ' t come together well . if that doesn ' t bother you , they are great boots . but it sure did bother me . : / 
my feet are n heaven ! super soft lining , and they fit like a dream ! i wear a size 8 , but i usually wear 8 1 / 2 because i like the room . where this comes in whole sizes only , i ordered a 9 , figuring with socks , it would be perfect . nope . they were a bit too big . returned and ordered an 8 , they fit like a dream ! super cute , too . there ' s straps all over the place to adjust the calves perfectly . it comes laced , with a spare set of laces . the treads are perfect for an icy sidewalk , nice and thick with plenty of grip . perfect ! 
believe the hype . allen edmonds makes excellent shoes and have great customer service as well . for most of my life i had the firm belief that dress shoes were supposed to be uncomfortable . until i tried these . i want to eventually buy a pair of strands for everyday use because i know i won ' t be wearing the plain cap toes as often as i would love to . 
a college professor once told me that the first thing someone notices about you when you meet them is your shoes . as important as first impressions are , it ' s vital to be wearing a sharp pair of shoes that say you care about yourself . these are a classic shoe that is not too flashy , but conservative and timeless . also , they ' re very comfortable . 
[ - - - quick summation on quality in general - - - ] leather is noticeably soft without the plastic feel of the usual sub 200 $ departmental dress shoes ( boston , johnston and murphy etc . ) . the leather sole is stiff and rigid and they are meant to conform to your foot over time so there may or may not be a break - in period however , you will have to let them get acquainted with your foot . these can be shined which hold superior gloss versus many of the other less expensive brands . moreover , you buy these shoes to stay with you a long time as they can be re - crafted ( new sole , and tightens the leather a bit ) for a little above 100 $ which will turn them into a somewhat new pair of allen edmonds shoe that is already somewhat molded with your foot . quality : 9 / 10 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ - - - issues - - - ] it took me ( 2 ) returns : 1 from amazon and 1 directly from allen edmonds to force my hand in putting 2 stars for an allen edmond shoe . this being said , i will still buy their shoes for the hope that this one - - flagship and iconical line - - is an anomaly . my current shoe closet has many pairs of allen edmonds shoes e . g . strand , lasalle , neumora . with experience in 1st quality and 2nd quality , nothing has been less than expected from a ' superior line ' when examining the quality of the shoe ( with the exception of subjective observations ) . the park avenue , the staple of allen edmonds shoes , has been the pariah where these were supposed to be the foundation . 1st pair : as noted by many people over the internet , with the park avenues seemingly being the only ' violater ' , there is ' bowing ' i . e . top - line bulge at the mouth of the shoe . explained more , the part surrounding your ankle has too much ' excess ' of leather i . e . seemingly not made proportionally so that the sides bulge from excess material . the latter allows much creasing on the sides so that it looks like your ankle is a . . . chicken ankle ( think of pants that are too big ' creasing ' at the waist when a belt is cinched ) . my first pair from amazon had this problem along with unsightly ' creasing ' at the mouth from excess leather . needless to say , it was not a good looking shoe . in general , i can make compromises with other , less expensive , pairs of shoes however , when i make the conscious choice to purchase quality shoes i expect nothing less than perfection ( at least enough perfection by eyeing it ) . when you choose to spend more for a luxury car or watch , you may be overspending however one thing will not be a question : the quality is above average and it will work as intended ; nothing more . from the latter problems i returned them based on the bowing . 2nd pair : the first shoe looked as it should and there was minimal bowing , see normal . the next shoe ( right pair ) had a flopping right side on the mouth ( top - line bulge . . . again ) . this was confirmed when i put my foot inside . it was so bad i could stick 2 - 3 fingers , one on top of the other , inside the ' space ' made by the too big leather . it looked very , very bad . * it should be noted that i can be so adament about the lack of ' tightness ' around the mouth because of my experience with previous allen edmonds shoes . . . and dress shoes in general ( from various manufacturers ) . the sizing is not the issue . * knowing amazon does not allow returns after the 1st ( rightfully so as they , at that point , figure it is an issue with the product in general ) , i contacted customer service and explained the situation . they thus investigated their current stock for the problem . meanwhile i contact allen edmonds directly where i was met with the much documented good customer service where i was told to send them back even though i purchased them from an online retailer with the explanation of the problem . 3rd pair : receiving them fairly quickly after i sent them , everything on the shoe looked good . . . finally . . . until i examined a little more in detail . as i am not necessarily a ' finicky ' or judging person ( not too harshly ) where i would forgive scrapes , scratches , creases ( before i wear them ) , or smudges , the next problem is unacceptable for a the type of shoe manufacturer allen edmonds represents . * crooked toe cap * as i said previously that everything on the 3rd pair looked fine ( top line bulge was non existent and tight ) , there was a new problem - - the toe cap . where it is supposed to be straight across - - 180 degrees - - the shoe , it was more like 165 . instead of a plane , it was a slope . the right shoe was more apparent than the left , however they would be ' straight ' if i walked with my toes outward ( pretty good if i was trying out a charlie chaplin act . . though for normal use , pretty tough ) . at this point , i am getting slightly impatient with constantly exchanging shoes however the problems are so that i cannot accept a subpar pair from a manufacturer that you pay for having ' pristine ' quality . these have all been 1st quality for the record . even the seconds i purchased were obviously better ' put together ' than this ' lucky ' group of three . even with the issues , i intend to exchange them until i get a pair that is satisfactory . if this begins to be the norm rather than the exception , and other lines are affected as well , then i will start to question what direction allen edmonds , as a company , is wanting to go . [ - - - 9 / 4 / 2013 addendum - - - ] 4th pair : exchanged the 3rd pair ( the exchange directly from allen edmonds with the toe - cap crooked problem ) with amazon and the new pair has none of the above noted problems . no bowing and no crooked toe cap . not sure what would cause these ' quality control ' problems as the pairs that i received would be fairly ok as seconds even though the bowing really adjusts the look of the shoe . the cost of replacing this many times and at the risk of allen edmond ' s customer base changing their opinion somewhat of the companies ' philosophy and quality would certainly not be worth having to go over a shoe for its proper production . 4th time should not be a charm in this case ; not with the price and reputation that is behind this shoe . 
my wife always says you can save money on a lot of things , but when it comes to shoes , don ' t skimp . with shoes , you generally get what you pay for . very true in this case . the first day i ever wore these i had to spend a marathon workday in our state capital during the state legislative session . most of the day i was on my feet . i put these shoes on in the morning , wore them for 13 hours straight , up and down stairs , to and from a lunch meeting and other meetings , on city sidewalks , to and from and through an evening reception , etc . , and i never once thought of my feet ( other than looking down to admire how damn nice these shoes looked ) . i can ' t believe how comfortable they are . if you have to look nice for work or throw on a suite every now and again , i can ' t recommend these shoes highly enough . 
a heavy , seemingly well made shoe . i have enjoyed them , but disappointed that the top metal shoe lace eyelet fell off in the first few weeks . 
these are the best shoes i ' ve ever owned . you can easily get a decade out of them with proper maintenance . the insoles are super comfortable , the leather is top - quality , and they fit like a glove . 
i was surprised how well this shoe fits and how comfortable it is , even the first time you wear it . 
this is a high quality , extremely comfortable shoe . it gets more comfortable the more you wear it , as it has a cork footbed that lacks a metal shank that most other dress shoes have . a negative review on stated that a salesman likened these to birkenstocks and used it as a slam against allen edmonds shoes . it is not a negative , but rather a feature that makes them more comfortable with wear , as the footbed molds to and cushions your foot . if you are looking for a little more flair may i recommend you check the fifth avenue model before buying this which has some slight broguing along the edge of the cap on the toe . allen edmonds will recraft these shoes for a slight fee , refinishing the leather and replacing the sole and heel , which means these shoes will last 20 - 30 years , so they really are worth the price , and a great bargain when you think about it like that . 
good fit good everything except maybe not as good as the gucci loafers and church ' s ? needs to concentrate on fitting if it wants to be a legend . 
i have a pair of park avenue cap - toes identical to these , and they are perfect . they are broken in after about three steps , and after three years of pretty hard use they still look fantastic and feel terrific . these shoes are made the old - fashioned way , with no cheap concessions to the bean - counters . these shoes are american craftsmanship through and through - - the way it used to be and should still be . i am a lawyer and when i am representing clients in court i owe it to them to look my professional best , and my allen edmonds shoes , including these park avenues , are all i will wear to court . you cannot find a more formal and professional shoe than these allen edmonds park avenues . highly recommended without reservation . rjb . 
well made and very comfortable dark brown dress shoe . a subtle quality that many people won ' t consciously notice , but will make an impression anyway . skip the bush or dockers with their no - nonsense rubber soles and heavy padding made necessary by a poor fit and choice of materials . the allen edmonds ' all leather construction fits like a well made glove and won ' t make your feet look like boats . they say that human evolution causes us to favor mates with symmetrical features and proportionate body parts . don ' t shoot yourself in the foot by buying the bulky over padded dress shoes ! spend the money to get something that will make you look good . . . the allen edmonds are the shoe . also do yourself a favor and research proper shoe care , then buy a care kit . . . these shoes deserve it ! 
i ' m a big le mystere fan , and when i was a c cup the lace style was definitely a fav . it ' s just a tad itchy ( not too bad ) and not quite as smooth under tight tees as the dream tisha , but the pretty aesthetic of the bra definitely makes up for it . it also tends to minimize just a little compared to the dream tisha , which is a plus for me . my experience is that the lace tisha tends to run a bit smaller than dream tisha , so you might need to order a cup size larger if you ' re between sizes . it also looks better on c , d cups . i recently gained some body fat and went to a dd / e , and i don ' t feel as supported with the lace version ( some spillage issues ) . so i ' ll stick with the dream tisha until i can lose the extra pounds , but will def return to the pretty lace version when i ' m a d cup again . 
i have never owned a better fitting bra . i wear a 36f and this keeps the girls in place all day . i really plan on stocking up on as many of these bras as i can because it is so hard to find a comfortable bra in the size i need . extremely happy . 
well it fits , which is a difficult thing for my size ( 40h ) . a lot of bras i ' ve purchased are sized incorrectly and are usually way to small so it is a treat to find one that actually covers me and doesn ' t squish me together or squash out my armpits . it also has great lift and is smooth ( no pointy or bumpy business ) . the only reason i don ' t love it yet , is comfort . it is a little bit painful right now , the straps dig and the alastic around my ribs is very uncomfortable . i am hoping these areas will relax or i will adjust because other than that , it is everything i have been searching for . : ) 
i did not buy this bra on amazon but wanted to weigh in on all the hype after trying it out for myself . i have a small frame - usually size 2 - 4 in women ' s clothes - but with an unusual bra size ( 30ff or 32f ) . most bras , even if they look pretty in a sample photo , look matronly once you get into the larger cup sizes . this one is definitely different . the dream tisha lace bra has a youthful yet sexy look while still providing full coverage and exceptional support . it gives a nice , smooth line under clothes and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time . plunge bra styles in larger cup sizes will look nice but too much falling out in the course of normal day - to - day activities keep that style from really working as an everyday bra . this one provides all the support i need and still makes me feel pretty wearing it . to be honest , the whole " oprah ' s best bra " hype was a turn off and kept me from trying this for some time . i ' m glad i relented and gave it a try . i am very happy and surprised with this bra and will definitely buy more . 
i ordered this , and the sports version which i got at an amazing selling price of 19 buckeroos . i had never seen nor worn a contour bra before . this thing is like a & # 34 ; falsie & # 34 ; bra with the falsies built in ! you could be totally flat chested , and wha laaaa ! the le mystere to the rescue . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! well , i am anything but flat chested . these bras i will keep , since i got both at good prices and perhaps i will get used to them . they seem bulky under my clothes , but i am used to wacoal which is simply fabric supporting my breasts . ( by the way , i hate the term & # 34 ; girls & # 34 ; . . . . ) anyway . what more can i say . . . . . i can ' t believe that people actually like these bras . . . . . they are not really bras , in my opinion , but rather like i say : falsies built in to a bra . i suppose , if you were someone with uneven breasts , or someone who needed a prosthesis , these bras would be good . . . . for the everyday person tho , i ' m skeptical . they do make you feel very large breasted . . . . you are aware of your large breasts when wearing the bra . . . . whether this is good or bad we ' ll have to see . 
ok , when i took it out of the box i did laugh . this bra looked cartoonish . i almost put it right back in the box to return . but then i tried it on . . . and it fits great , and looks great ! 
i love this bra . . . . for an underwire bra , it is very comfortable . the straps are thick enough they don ' t cut into my shoulders and besides , it ' s very feminine to look at too . 
i ordered this bra to wear under t - shirts and tank tops this summer . i was looking for something that was supportive , smoothing and wouldn ' t ' show through ' on cool evenings ( if you know what i mean ) . i ' m 5 ' 6 and 140 lbs . i ordered my usual size 34d . let me start by saying that it is truly a beautiful bra . i loved that it had three hooks and eyes in the back . . . something you don ' t usually find on a 34d . it was very supportive . . . but perhaps a bit too supportive . i felt like it was minimizing my girls . i also felt that they didn ' t look rounded , but rather the cups forced them into a sort of cone shape . we aren ' t talking madonna bra here , but it was reminiscent of something you ' d see in a mad men era look . not really my thing . i also thought the back band was a bit scratchy and that the underwire came up a bit high on the sides . i don ' t carry much underarm flab but that could be an issue if someone looking to purchase did . i had it on for about 20 min . and couldn ' t wait to take it off . way too smooshed into the cups and way to scratchy on my back . sadly , this beautiful bra is going back . 
i have been searching for the right size bra for myself because i had gotten breast enhancement surgery a while back . i saw this bra and thought it would be perfect because in the picture it doesnt look as if it is complete coverage and cute enough to wear out . wrong . this bra ( in a 34 g ) is full coverage . im taking even when i wear a tank top ( thick strapped ) it is sticking out over my shirt . keep in mind that i dont dress trampy in anyway at all . there is o way i can wear this bra out and can only wear it to work when i have a shirt that goes all the way up to my neck . . v necks , forget about it . i am so disappointed . very very bad purchase . 
this is a good looking bra and very well constructed . in fact the cup sizes are good and the angles of support are well done ( often one of my pet peeves with bras ) . but i wear a 36 , which is what i ordered , and this thing on its very last hooks is still extremely tight . my size hasn ' t changed . ideally the size should match the measurements on the middle hooks , in my opinion . then you could go up one set if it was a bit loose or down one if its a bit tight . if i ordered a size larger the cup positions in the front would have been wrong . i will keep it , but be forewarned . i will just wear it when i only need to wear it for a few hours . an all - day bra it won ' t be for me unless it stretches out , and i think it ' s probably too well constructed for that ( which normally would be a good thing ) . 
lovely bra , very pretty , cups are kinda hard , but not something unusual for this type of bra , they soften after washes . found it to be a bit snug for 34d , but is ok , i know sizes vary and is hard when you shop online for bra ' s . i like it , i would suggest maybe bumping your size up to a 36 if you are a 34 for example . but comfy and very form fitting and adds a nice lift as well without the uncomfortable feeling of a push up bra . 
the le mystere bra is about the best undergarment i ' ve ever had . the only thing about it is that it must be washed before being worn or it is , for some reason , itchy . maybe it ' s the sizing they put into it before it leaves the factory , but make sure you wash this bra on the most delicate cycle you have and absolutely add a good fabric softener . use cold water and whatever you do , don ' t put it in the dryer . it will ruin it permanently . the le mystere dries quickly overnight when hung on a hanger . it fits beautifully without adding to your size . instead it adds shape . it is the same bra sold by many on - line specialty shops , but it ' s much less expensive through amazon . one thing i did not like was the way it was packed ; one cup was inverted into another and this temporarily deformed the cup . i had to really work at it to get the outside material to fit the inner foam perfectly . never store it by inverting the cups . it will definitely ruin it , and when you receive it , get it out of the package immediately and put it " into proper shape " by un - inverting the cup that the packer inverted . you ' ll be glad you did it as soon as possible , because the longer it stays inverted , the harder it is to set right . the bra is worth every cent . 
especially under a t - shirt ! i ' ve read reviews on this bra and know that it was an oprah favorite . i decided to finally give it a try and have not been disappointed . after a professional bra - fit and a $ 162 new bra i decided to check on amazon and give the le mystere a try as my 2nd new bra size purchase . the pricing was & # 34 ; great & # 34 ; and i like the bra . . . . a win win situation ! ! 
after reading the reviews for this bra i took the plunge and tried it . it fits well and gives beautiful ample cleavage without being overkill . i gotta say though , this is one stiff bra . i dont think i can get it in a drawer without smashing its form . it seems to be very heavy neoprene , there will be no ' nips ' showing thru . also , trying on this bra . . . you know how we do ladies , put bra on backwards to close the hooks and turn to the front . it was a struggle to turn this bra around to the front . i will fight the good fight for this bra because it looks so great on . 
liked this bra , fits good , just a little itchy in some areas on the straps , band and arm pit area . that might go away after a couple uses and washing though . 
i ' m 55 and wear a 40b . i ' ve tried olgas , bali , breezie , penny ' s brand , etc . and this fits , fells and looks the best . it looks a bit like a breast plate but one i put a blouse or shirt on , my chest looks 18 again ! so i ' m buying another le mystiqe in anther style . 
i am soooo impressed with this bra . when i first opened the box and looked at it . i instantly turned my nose up . i was a bit disappointed cause the bra appeared to be padded . my first thought was , i wear an h cup . i certainly dont need anything extra . i am soooo glad i tried this bra on . oh my ! ! ! instantly i was hooked . this bra is amazing ! ! ! i immediately jumped on line to order more . sadly the price has gone up from just a few days ago . oh well , that won ' t stop me . i ' m just that happy with this bra that i am willing to pay more . i will admit that i only had the bra on for a few minutes so i can ' t say how it feels to wear an entire day . but i will take this baby for a test run tomorrow as i do some shopping at the mall . i tried this bra on and put my tshirt on just to chk my silouhette . wow ! ! ! ! ! this bra lifts and separates ! ! wish this bra came in red . 
the band is too tight , and i wore it for weeks in hopes it would stretch out . the outside edge of the underwires are curved too much toward the center of the chest . this pulls the breast away from the stays , and it does make them look perky but makes one feel so bound it ' s difficult to breathe . i had to bend the underwires just to be able to wear the bra . the adjustable straps do not have enough length to adjust for me , so i suffer dig - in , and this is the worst of all . every day my shoulders and the tops of my breasts where the straps meet the cups were red from pulling and irritation . the bra simply fits too small . and that lace cami part ? it shows as little bumps through every garment except a fair isle sweater . i would have returned it , but it was too late by the time i was finished with trying to make it work . 
this was a gift for my daughter . she absolutely loves it . it ' s her favorite brand . it washes up nicely and this brand doesn ' t wear out or stretch out . 
ordered 3 . . love the bra , , fits well and true to size . the bra is just as expected as though i purchased it myself in the department store . . . 
ok i bought 2 le mystere bras and i loved them both , then i wanted to get another one and decided to try this one with the lace . i thought it would be nice with lower cut shirt or if the strap were showing it would look pretty . the bra fit good 34e ( 34dd ) but it was very itchy , the back and the arm straps . it also seemed to rub in the armpit area . i loved the tisha and the techfit so much better # 1 techfit ! 
this bra is comfortable . it appears smoothly under a shirt . it does help smooth you out on your sides . only issue is the wire under the cup tends to break after 3 months of use . 
i bought this bra because the first person who reviewed it was a bra specialist and she said it was great . it did not look like the greatest thing in the world when i looked at it , but i took her word and ordered it . she was absolutely correct ! i wear an unfindable size : 42c : that is it is unfindable at dillards , maceys etc . it is frequently difficult to find on the web . finding one that is half way feminine is almost a " forget it " issue . but this bra does pretty well . it fits like a dream . it looks pretty feminine . and , i can get it in the elusisive white without paying full price . i am back to buy another in a different color and thought it was my turn to step up and say how it went . it went great . so go ahead and try it . i bought 3 different sizes when i first ordered because i was not convinced that it was true to size . but i had to send the two extra back . it does fit . it does work . and , it looks a lot sexier than that thing i gave up and purchased at the discount store . so , go ahead , try it . you will like it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
this is by far the best bra i have ever owned . i know it ' s pricey but believe me you get what you pay for . i am a 36 ddd , and have never found a bra that was comfortable . i always thought i needed a bra with thick straps to comfortable but when it fits properly around your torso , it doesn ' t put the same pressure on your shoulders . buy one now . you will not regret it . 
edited review : i ' ve noticed that with consistent use of this bra that the lace and stuff edges of the bottom of band get somewhat scratchy and irritating after awhile . i ' m hoping that laundering the product may help the fabric relax a bit . the top lace edge of the cups can also show up some under some fabrics so it is not a perfect t - shirt bra . original review : fits well . seems to be seamless . the lace at the top edge helps prevent gapping and visible seams at the top edge of the cup . i ' m noticing that the straps seem not to lie completely flat at the inner scalloped edges but will update if this becomes a bigger problem . overall , very pleased and would try other bras by this manufacturer too . during the first hour of consistent use of this bra , i became concerned that the straps would dig into the sides near my underarm . they did for about half an hour but seemed to relax after that . the straps are somewhat wide - set so if you have narrow or curved ( bad posture ) shoulders , they could be problematic . 
i have heard that these are oprah ' s favorite bras which in itself says a lot . i have three of them and love the support and silhouette they provide . the bras have contour ( not padded ) cups that provide great shape and a wide band that provides great support . they tend to run a little big which is the only reason i am not giving them a 5th star but if you are a little curvier you should be fine . 
this bra is very comfortable and great fitting . i am very satisfied with my purchase . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable everyday bra . 
this fit terribly . i think it ran small in the cup and small in the band . seriously , it looked so atrocious when i put it on , didn ' t tack at the gore at all . . . blegh . 
this bra is the perfect , full coverage support bra . although i have owned a number of other supportive bras , this is by far the most comfortable , and it fits nicely and smoothly under my clothes . the support is not just preventing your breasts from migrating southward ( though it does that well ) , but it also provides effective support against bouncing up - - holding them in place even if you run up the stairs , turn sideways quickly or get on an amusement park ride . that is a huge advantage . most other bras i own , even high end ones and other le mystere ones , do not effectively control the upward bounce . i noticed another reviewer complained about itchiness . i own several of this bra , and yes , some do itch at first . it ' s not unique to this bra . with sensitive skin some of the fabric chemicals used on many bras are uncomfortable . don ' t let it deter you from owning this amazing bra . a quick rinse in woolite is enough to fix the problem if you experience it ( again , usually true to any bra except very cheap lace which this is not ) . i should mention that there are a couple things this bra is not . as you can see from the picture , it is full coverage with thick straps - - not right for every outfit . it also does not make your breasts look bigger or smaller , just perfectly shaped . my bra size has fluctuated with pregnancy and weight loss . in my experience , with the straps correctly adjusted , this bra fits perfectly to size . 
love the tisha line - probably the most comfortable and supportive bras i ' ve found . the lace on this one takes it to another level . unfortunately the size wasn ' t right for me so have to return it . i will definitely order another size . 
i thought i would like this bra due to the zillion positive reviews , but it looked awkward on . while it mostly fit , it pushed my bust together and sort of looked like . . . well , a sports bra . i also thought the lace trim was itchy . not flattering ( i ' m a 32 - 34 ff - g ) , so it went back . 
this is the most uncomfortable bra i ' ve ever tried to wear . the straps are too short so it kept hiking up in the back . i was constantly aware i was wearing it , it was so uncomfortable . i needed an odd size 44b , have a nerve injury in my left shoulder that acts up if the straps are too tight , and don ' t want an underwire . i bought this because of all the great reviews , but i felt like i was wearing some sort of medieval harness rather than a bra . the best bra in my mind is one i can forget i have on , and this wasn ' t it . 
this is a beautiful bra , great fit , looks so nice under knits . i have four of these bras in different colors . 
but . ot for me . . . . was looking for a full - coverage bra so have returned . lovely fabric and quality , as always , but not the style i needed . 
after trying many bras that claim to have excellent lift and support , i have finally found one that actually does ! this bra works even on the aging figure and supports firmly . it ' s pretty too . i resisted because of the price but now have to admit it ' s worth iti 
this bra fits as expected ( 38dd ) . however i find the cup mold a little hard . but provides good support . shoulder straps are ok , but would be better thicker . 
despite having great reviews and promise , this bra was not the one for me . the cup shape was terribly pointy and un - natural looking . i have returned it and hope this review alerts you to the awkward side - profile of this lacey bra . 
i didn ' t expect this to be the real thing by any stretch of the imaginary when i purchased it . but i didn ' t expect it to be real dollar store quality like it was . would not recommend this to anyone . 
i wasn ' t expecting super quality but these are below par . the & # 34 ; belt & # 34 ; is too flimsy , i took the accessories off and put them on one of my child ' s dress belts just so it ' d be more stable . overall he is having fun with it but i don ' t expect that it will last long . 
it ' s a great product for costumes , or for play for younger kids . it isn ' t a high quality or durable product . when the box it came in was delivered there was no damage to the outside of the box . when i opened the box , all the pieces were outside of the packaging it was supposed to be sealed into . all the items for the police belt were there , but i wasn ' t expecting the packaging for the product to be open . 
when you buy a police uniform for christmas , well , you need the proper equipement to fight crime . so , buy this . . . just prepair to be cuffed often and even ruffed up a little if you don ' t comply . . . glad it did not come with mace ! ! ! ! 
i searched hard to find a good quality police belt to go with my 6 year old grandson ' s police costume and this is the only choice i came up with . it is better than nothing , but the belt is very poor quality . i would pay more to have a police belt that would last , but i guess no one has decided to make one . i had to sew the holster loop back on the third day of it being used . however , my grandson didn ' t take this off except to sleep for days following his birthday . he is happy with it even though the metal hole covers on the belt have all come off . 
great costume , i got this for my fiance and it looked great . the boot covered sucked but the rest of the costume was good . he got a separate hat to supplement the outfit . 
living in tampa , you get to dress up like a pirate for multiple occasions . halloween and gasparilla being the two main ones . this outfit works great for both . although the jacket is made out of a thinner material , it keeps you warm on a chilly day . when i say chilly , i mean like 50s and breezy . i will continue to wear this for future events . 
i love this so much ! this is really a 4 . 5 star becasue the shirt is not that great , but everything else makes it worth it , the coat alone is the best part . i had so much fun dressing up the first time with the kids i just cant go 4 stars on this . again , the shirt is really flimsy , but i would get it for the coat alone at this cost ! i was going to get real boots , but these shoe covers are the best shoe cover type i ever saw and i have 7 kids and have seen a lot so i just ended up using them with black shoes and they look great . next year i probably will get real boot for the costume , but these shoe covers are very nice . 
jacket is definitely the best part of the costume . i ' m 6 ' 1 & # 34 ; , 170lbs and it fit great ( see my attached customer pic ) . i have somewhat skinny arms and the jacket was fairly form fit there . rest hung loose but as a pirate that ' s fine . if you have larger arms it might be really tight on you . bandana has the dreads attached , shirt and sash were cool . boot covers were the lowest point of the ensemble but you can find better ones for about $ 15 here on amazon . 
this is a pretty good costume for the price . the coat was actually surprisingly sturdy . the only problem i had with the costume is that through the course of the night , i had a few of the dreadlocks fall off of the bandana , but that ' s not that big of a deal ( in dc , we have plenty of & # 34 ; tumble - weaves & # 34 ; anyway ) . the boot coverings didn ' t fit the very best , but i still rocked a great jack sparrow look all night . 
buy the pirate sword and pirate pistol , and brown leatherette tri - fold pirate hat to complete the look . you ' ll have a sweet costume . accessories make the costume . yes , the boot covers are floppy but it ' s a costume . i safety pinned them in place to my pants based on other reviews to hold them in place . it looked better with them than without . if you ' ve got boots , perfect . the jacket ( awesome ) , bandanna - hair ( better than expected ) , and sash are worth it without the boot covers . i cut out the top of an old undershirt to make a huge v - neck to wear under the pirate shirt for added warmth . 
i was surprised by this - it wasn ' t as bad as many costumes . lots of detail and the bag really made for a good complete pirate . but it did run a bit small - my thin husband fit it but barely . i do highly recommend it - it ' s one of the better costumes out there . 
my son got me this for my birthday what a big surprise i had no idea , that was in december and now it is already full . 
i have an extensive watch collection . seiko , casio , citizen , timex , indiglo . . . . to name a few . i have too many boxes and wanted the at a glance choice ; to charge my watches with solar by dropping the box near the window - and a fine look . such a great price ! it has a lock but i don ' t use it . the boxes are perfect . 
looks great . holds all of my watches a a a a a a a a a a a a a 
i ' m pretty particular about getting high quality and good value . no , this is not a status watch box for the discerning connoisseur , but it works as expected and doesn ' t look bad doing it . i ' m very pleased with my purchase . it ' s worth checking out at the very least . 
great case and looks great to ! i don ' t mind keeping this watch case on the night stand to display my collection . the fit and finish look great and the inside is soft and spacious ! i own two now ! 
love the fact that i can see the content . this case is high quality , thus a bit more expensive than some other brand / products . 
bought this for hubby and he likes the watch case . i was a tiny bit disappointed at the cushions though . i was expecting they to be a little more classy , but hubby apparently didn ' t think anything of it . the case itself looks nice as expected . 
this case is so elegant with a good quality . . the leather is nice looking and it fit my husband big watches . . i highly recommend 
for all those watch collectors out there , this case is sure to fit the bill . it ' s elegant and sturdy , and with cushions that suit almost any watch . the lock is probably useless , but it adds to the look . 
i purchased this watch case for my husband as a christmas present . he has several nice watches that typically wind up in random locations around the house . he had mentioned before that he would like a watch case but i knew this wasn ' t something he wouldn ' t buy for himself . i did a little searching on amazon and found this reasonably priced display case and decided i would give it a shot . i couldn ' t have been more satisfied with the style and quality . the case itself is very well made and looks elegant on his night stand . his watches are larger ( even for a man ' s watch ) so i originally concerned that they wouldn ' t fit but they sit comfortably with no problem at all . my husband was very surprised with his present and loves it . i love that this holds 10 watches . he has 6 right now but i know he ' ll get more so this allows his collection room to grow . i have quite a few watches myself so i ' m tempted to get one for me ! highly recommend if you ' re looking for an elegant way to display and protect your watch collection . 
quality is good , very confortable , good service and fast shipping . if you want that this gloves work good to you , you have to choose a bigger size . overall , i recomend it 
i purchased these gloves for an unusual but very practical purpose - putting on my pantyhose . i don ' t wear them often anymore but when i do , i have a history of snagging them with my fingernails or whatever and decided that gloves would solve the problem . these work very nicely ! 
while these covered my hands the fit was weird . rothko makes a lot of military products so i trusted their products . i used these for my santa suit and they got the job done better than & # 34 ; santa gloves & # 34 ; . 
these were very cute . they run big ! they started getting holes by the end of one wear , however . one of them came with a slight yellow stain . i wore them anyway because i did not have time to replace . 
the gloves were great for our color guard , but be weary when taking them off and unsnapping them at the wrist . if you pull too hard the snap comes off the glove completely . we had young boys wearing these and non of the gloves have snaps any longer . 
these are nice parade quality white gloves . they are cloth , and fit great . these will go with my chauffeur outfit when driving family around for a special event . nice ! 
these gloves were very cheaply made . disappointed with this purchase . the material was so thin . it was not worth the price 
i have owned probably 5 pairs of these in black and 4 in brown . for some reason the insoles on the black ones all have worn out directly under the right big toe within a few months for unknown reasons while the brown pairs have never had this issue . they are very comfortable but unfortunately due to this insole wearing out problem i ' ll be switching to something else this time for my black shoes . if you are ordering a pair or whiskey / brown shoes these are a solid 5 star shoe , the black ones though are 1 star garbage . there must be some type of manufacturing difference in the insoles of the black and brown shoes that causes the black ones to be much less durable . and before someone asks why i went through multiple pairs of the black ones the answer is that i hate going to actual shoe stores and trying them on , once i find something that fits i stick with it but in this case i ' ll be forced to visit the shoe store . 
i pulled this shoe out of the box , and thought & # 34 ; this is the ugliest shoe i think i have ever seen & # 34 ; . it did not fit , as it was too small and the arch felt like it was in the wrong location . 
these are a great basic black shoe that will go with anything . i found them very stiff out of the box which i ' m hoping will subside after further wear and break in . these gave me a huge blister on my heel on the first wear which is very rare for me so i ' m hoping the leather softens up . otherwise they fit as expected for size 11 . 
i love this shoe as i do a lot of walking , in business casual clothes . for travel it is the ultimate of tsa friendly - slip on and slip off . sure sole does wear easily - every few months - but its expected and i just buy 2 or so a year . . . i love the shoe . 
my size : 8 women , 7 mensize ordered : 7fit : 1 / 2 inch at the toe , however a very comfortable fitstyle : love this style , nice casual / dressquality : great quality 
awesome shoes ! it fits perfect ! i needed brown shoes to add to my wardrobe and this was perfect . i highly recommend these slip on shoes . they ' re very sharp and women love them ! 
i ordered because of the brand , my last pair lasted 6years and finally the sole began separating from the shoe , well after than many years a person would expect that . these were a bit snug , but i was always told eastland shoes fit the same way every time you put them on . i love em 
not as comfortable as the grenada - - my all - time favorite eastland and , in fact , favorite shoe - - but reasonably comfortable for a long day . if i ' m on my feet for more than four hours , it starts to hurt . 
i loved the shoe , but i ordered the wrong size and i found another that i liked better . it is a very well made shoe , quality leather , nice fit . 
these shoes were not dark brown as i thought they were going to be so i sent them back and also they scuffed up very easily . i sent these shoes back ! ! ! ! ! 
i was so very glad to find these shoes ! i was a bit worried at first - it had been so long since i had a brand new pair of slip on shoes ! the reason for that is because eastlands are so good , i can wear a pair for 10 + years ! i have a pair of brown similar ones that i ' ve worn for about that long - maybe longer . but they last forever and are the only brand i will buy . i ' m still wearing the brown ones , but wanted a pair of black ones to match my purse and coat for winter . they felt a bit tight at first , but it ' s been so long since i ' ve had to break in a pair of shoes since eastlands last so long ! wore them a couple of nights at home , broke in perfectly , now they ' re my new favorites ! i ' ve tried others , but eastlands are still the best : ) 
they arrived a day after the expected date , there was a mishap with the carrier . when i took them out of the bag , they look to be too small , however when i put them on they actually fit . there was a small defect with the plug thingie that holds the sandal straps in place . it is secure so i decided to keep them . i wish the straps across my feet were a little bit wider because my feet swell . overall , very cute flopflops . sturdy and soft . nice logo on the strap . 
quality is good , and they are not too hard , like cheaper flip flops . but , they are too heavy for a flip flop . they weigh more than other havaianas . the search continues for a good flip flop - that is not too hard . 
these are the best things to walk on ever ! ! however , like any plastic flop the toe part will give you blisters ! ! ! i continue to wear them just so i can feel the pain to know my feet are alive & # 128533 ; 
my friends dog chewed her favourite pair of flip flops so i got her these to replace them . she tells me they fit exactly as expected of a well known firm and that she is very happy with them . they were delivered very quickly too . thank you . 
it ' s either havaiana brazil or ocean minded bethany style that i wear . so comfortable ! i would highly recommend . come on summer ! 
i received a pair of havianas ( didn ' t know they were so famos ) and i had them for years . i now had to purchase a new pair , but this ones are not at all as mine were . they are too thin , i can feel the floor , and when wearing for long periods my back hurts . kept the ones that i had already used , and reurned the rest . 
so well made , i wore these on a 2 week trip to india , no worries about them at all . i have thrown them in the wash , they are sturdy and comfortable . 
very very loose very large . only for extremely puffy or supper high arch feet . let oprah have them . . . and i love our oprah . don ' t buy these , 
and not grossly overpriced like all - too - many of their competitors . the recipient was pleased , but is insisting on totally wearing out her current pair of flip flops before starting to wear these . 
i love this brand of flip flop , and these pretty much fit as expected and work as expected . the price is good , the fit is standard - if you ' re looking for a pretty solid generic , comfortable flip flop , these are for you . i love them . they always last me years . 
these flip - flops have a very nicely cushiony sole and the typical rubber straps , and are well made with no irritating edges or lumps like i ' ve experienced with cheap ( or sometimes not so cheap ) sandals . the 37 / 38 br fit fine on my 71 / 2 wide feet . how durable they are , only time will tell - every flip - flop i ' ve ever had ended up with the thong part between the toes pulling out of the sole or breaking . as the description says , the shoes are labelled with the men ' s size . mine are marked size 6 but are a women ' s 7 / 8 . 
welcome addition on a freezing - cold day . not welcome in a 7 - 11 gas station or the bank though . these are better than the ones that cover your mouth : if you wear glasses ( the other kind fogs ' em up ) theseare just fine . 
the actor i had wearing this mask wanted to keep it ha ! it ' s pretty warm and fits just about any size head . just don ' t walk into a bank wearing one of these ok . 
i ordered this one for my daughter and the hot pink one for her friend . unfortunately they did not arrive on time ( and i paid extra for expedited shipping in anticipation of predicted snow storm , this was the first problem i ' ve had with things not arriving on time but i had another problem with another order yesterday , contacted amazon about yesterday ' s problem and they handled it ) and the girls did not get to use them until about a month later when we had our next snow storm here in nc . the girls reported they were great and really helped to keep them warm . highly recommend ! 
i wear a size 7 3 / 4 hat and this fits over my noggin very comfortably . the delightful olive drab color makes me look like an amphibian . ribbit . 
same as for the neon yellow ski mask to prevent triggering of pain from trigeminal neuralgia . the holes for the masks that work are not finished tightly as they are for the royal color mask i ordered . 
works great for long dog walks on sub zero days . just remember to take it off when you go to the bank . 
poor fit , poor quality , non - existent insulation . this item was to be used for the purpose of skiing . i can only imagine it now used to scare the neighbors throwing out the trash with this item included in it . 
my mean neighbor was startled when i delivered her prop 13 mail ( you ' re welcome for the tax break now stop complaining about everything ) that had come in our box . in hindsight , i should have worn a cape too because she didn ' t say thank you . 
helpfully bright color . a bit on the tight side , but i have a large head . eye - loop string broke , but that just made this into a cyclops mask , really . not a problem . does help in keeping your head warm on these stupidly cold days and nights . 
this mask was everything i could hope for . it fits well , it ' s cozy . . . a bit itchy , but i expected that . lovely product . 
there was a rich man from nottingham who fell into a river . . . what a dope ! he slipped on a rope ! now look at him shiver . . . an inexpensive ski mask . bruce wayne wouldn ' t use it , but dick grayson might . if you ' re looking for something basic , this will keep you warm . 
keeps me warm , maybe a bit too warm but still totally worth it . i look so cool smokin outside in my ski mask , all the other kids are jealous . buy this mask . 
good for harsh winter conditions . i like this mask the best of the ones i ' ve had ( half face masks , 2 / 3s , 3 / 4s , and a few full face similar to this one . ) it ' s really soft and comfortable to wear , while protecting me from the cold . it does cover the neck which is a plus as i usually do unzip my jacket a bit to get some of the steam out from the core while boarding down the slopes . doesn ' t really get sweaty , and if i get a bit sweaty it ' s usually pretty good to wick it off . one down side is that it ' s not good with snow or rain . it will get soaked if it starts snowing on you . but that ' s to be expected with any cloth . i recommend if anyone needs . i also prefer this 3 hole mask over a single large face hole masks which i also have some of . 
it ' s ok for what it is supposed to do . the knit will let light and cold air unto the face , which is a drawback . i was going to use this to cover myself up after a face peel , but i can ' t because the holes are bigger than i thought . also the eye holes are very very wide ( wider than the picture ) . i guess they are trying to compensate for all the face shapes and types . 
not as well made as i thought it would be and the color was off some minor pulls in the material 
so , im not a crook . but when im out on the town , so to speak , and i want some anonymity , cause im kinda famous , well this hat lets me go outside unnoticed by angry mobs , or fans , or the paparazi . 
this is a very good product . my face and neck stay warm in the coldest weather . it ' s soft and light weight . i ' ve been using it every day . 
needed this for my buddy for his deathstroke costume . bought the mask and had to use this over the face to cover the rest . and i admit . it worked ! this was awesome ! material got a lil itchy after a while . . but i guess it would be expected 
i love everything about this bra . the fix , the feel , the fabric . it ' s so wonderful and fit ' s true to size . 
this bra is odd for a modern day bra . the cup is pointed , which makes it too big ! if it wasn ' t so pointed , it would fit perfectly . 
i bought this style in a dark teal color two years ago , and it was one of the most comfortable bras i ' ve ever owned . it runs true to size , doesn ' t dig in , and creates a smooth / no - show line under t - shirts and knits . it also doesn ' t stretch out after repeated wearing . also , here are some tips that i picked up from my sister - in - law , who worked in the nordstrom lingerie department for over ten years . don ' t wear the same bra two days in a row and usingforever new fabric care wash 32 oz . to wash your bras . ( woolite will cause the fibers in elastic to wear down , but forever new doesn ' t do that . ) i wash mine on delicate in a lingerie bag and lay them flat to dry , and they last at least two years before they start stretching out . 
so did a lot of research to make sure i correctly measured and such , turns out the cup size was too big . the band fit fine , so on to find the right cup size . the natori i have purchased in the past tended toward smaller cups that was not the case with this purchase . the product was sent back the next day . it appeared to be well made and the material felt nice but as i stated it was the wrong size in the cup . 
this bra seems very high quality and looks great in the pics but creates a pointy 1950 ' s - esqe silhouette . if that doesn ' t bother you than i think you would find it a great bra , comfortable but still including pretty details ( the straps are very flattering ) . and , just because i find it helpful in reviews - i ' m 5 ' 6 and a 34 ddd . 
my only complaint about this bra is that you have to take a pair of pliers to move the clips on the straps to adjust them . i recall i had that same problem with the original one i purchased years ago . that being said , it is a stunning comfortable bra ! 
i got the auburn or brown wig and am very happy with this gorgeous almost human hairlike beauty ! delivery was on time . fit is just right and i have a large head ha ha . texture of hair is sooo lifelike that it is startling ! color is supberb . color is a little lighter than the photo and the wig is easy to wear since it is light . a great buy . rubie ' s glamor auburn wig rocks . i would and do recommend this pretty pretty wig to anyone : ) you will enjoy this wig and that cannot be said of some wigs . 
bad wig , horrible quality . i mean , what do you expect for the price . . . still it was way crappier than i thought it would be , even though my expectations were low . unless you ' re going as a hill - billy for halloween i would pay an extra $ 5 and get a better wig . 
the wig is ok for the money looks good we do not have something to place the wig to keep it until use , it tangles quickly but is good for the price 
it is just as pictured and didn ' t make my head hot . looks great ! i would just take care to not get it too tangly . handle lightly until you wear it . 
used in and easter program at church . it worked out very well . a good piece to add to your costume collection . 
i ' m rather happy with it , it gives me a goth sexy look for my cam site which is fun if i could post pictures i would 
i never did figure out how to set this and neither has anyone else i ' ve asked . the time is correct twice a day , though . 
cheap and time worthy . bought for a gift for teenagers that will want to wear it in the sea . got one for myself too 
my old one broke . my pedometer one stopped working . so i needed another one i could sweat in . this one is standard but works well . the blue is a different shade online than in person but that ' s ok ! 
i have had this for more than a year , i think . i really like it ! it was inexpensive but does not look or feel cheap and has plenty of features . it is a pretty blue , comfortable , and has yet to show any scratches or marks . i have used it while swimming in a pool and at the beach and while playing moderate intensity sports . perfect for a casual or sports watch . 
watch face too small , can ' t see a thing . i ended up giving this away . there are better choices , thank you 
i love this watch ! its perfect for a small wrist . easy to read numbers . it shows you the day of the week and month and its comfortable . i love the blue because it goes with pretty much everything . the other colors they have are really nice as well . ( i wear a lot of blue ) . its lightweight and supposedly waterproof . i like it too much to find out . also normally rubber bands become uncomfortable when you start to sweat nope not this one . overall for a cheap watch its the best . it has more features and comfort than my $ 100 watch . 
i ' m rough on my running watches , which i generally never take off , so i don ' t blame the manufacturer when they only last a couple of years . i have had a number of timex running watches since my first " timex marathon " [ the " mary decker " ] in 1984 , and have found them to be accurate , durable , and the stopwatch function easy to use . i especially like that timex makes sports watches in a " medium " size - - they don ' t call them " women ' s " , but that ' s what they are . this watch was easy to set upon its arrival , and can be looked at in the dark because of the " indiglo " feature which is now apparently standard on timex sports watches . sports watches don ' t change much from year to year anymore , so it ' s great to get one which may be last year ' s model and save some money . 
i ' ve had this watch for 6 years - it ' s my every day , every situation watch . i am * mean * to watches - hairspray , sunscreen , bug spray , gardening , sports , swimming , sweating . i use the timer / stopwatch . i use the alarm . so , my darling husband wanted to get me a " nice looking " watch for mother ' s day - - i requested ( and received ) another one of these ! i ' ll try to keep it nicer . this is a great watch . wear it , abuse it , forget it ' s on . it ' s not itchy and it doesn ' t pull your arm hairs . it ' s easy to set and use . 
my wife is 67 and loves a watch that she can see and has a light . this one is great . 
i will admit i have only had it one day but so far i love it . the color is great . it wasn ' t difficult to program once you read the directions . i like the 2nd time zone and the fact that it has a timer and a stopwatch . date and day of week show but with a quick push of the top right button one can see the month as well . i like the beep at the hour . helps keep me on track . i plan to wear every day except for dressier functions . 
nice watch for proce but the controls are a little hard to manage . i do like the lit dial feature though . 
i love the color , the way it fits and looks . it is perfect for me because i swim every day and go snorkeling several times a year . 
this arrived on time and was just what i was looking for . a small size watch for my daughter to wear everywhere . she likes it and it is small enought to look right on her small wrist . 
i give these watches to less fortunate hard working kids . they love them and wear them every day . great gifts . 
i got this for my daughter as a replacement . she likes it and wears it daily . it seems to be comfortable and is easy to set as she set it w / o instructions . she also has a seiko automatic watch but seems to prefer this one . now if only i could get her to do more around the house . 
this watch is pretty much perfect for me . it is durable , long lasting ( had it for quite some time with no problems what so ever - no battery problems or scratches or anything ) . i ' ve had a lot more expensive watches that might look flashier but don ' t last or function long . at the time i bought it , it cost something like $ 10 - $ 14 . can ' t beat that . only complaint is the alarm is too quite and the indiglo function is not very bright . 
i wear this watch and once his died i immediately converted him . he keeps it at work and wears it there . 
this watch has the simple to use and set alarm my 24 year old nephew requested for the watch he needs while attending law school . considering his past treatment of watches i knew it needed to be an inexpensive watch since he usually loses them . i was delighted that it looked to be of good quality and had an attractive but understated design . after already thanking me for the watch and wearing it out the house christmas eve my nephew has skyped to me that he is getting a lot of use out the watch and is utiliziing the alarms on a regular basis . he offerred that information up out of the clear blue without me asking him so he must be impressed with it . he ordinarily never contacts me ! hopefully he is learning the true value of a thing is not what it costs or how flashy it may be . just maybe because it is so useful he won ' t lose this one ! actually there is no reason to take it off since it is water resistant even if it goes into the water . i got another one for my other nephew who i noticed wears it . he is in his last year high school so you know it has to be considered at least sorta cool looking . 
it looks very cool for a sub $ 15 watch , is easy to set up , and does it main functions well . i wanted to have a watch i could take to the gym and on vacation without having to worry about losing it . this watch fits the bill . 
gave this watch as a xmas present to a young guy at the office . it looks relly nice and sporty . he loved it . 
it a cheap watch , but it feels much more durable than the $ 10 cost on amazon . it works for the industrial environment that i work on in that i don ' t care if it gets ruined . from the initial feel of it i am guessing it will last a couple years of use before the band gives out , and that is more than enough for what i invested into it . it has an alarm , two seperate times , a stop watch , and a light . 
i needed a watch for running and didn ' t know where to start . i ' ve always been a timex fan since my youth and decided to check them out . i liked this watch and decided to go for it . it ' s only 15 . 00 . it looks great and you cannot even feel it on your arm while running . it keeps great time and the functions / features are easy to understand and use . i use the stopwatch feature to time my runs and everything has worked out great so far . you can " freeze " your time at a particular spot in your run , so you can take the time to look at it and evaluate your pace , but the actual stopwatch is still running in the background , so you just click back over and keep on goin ' . it has two time zone features and the stop watch , both of which come in handy . the light works very well and cuts off automatically after a short while . it ' s the best 15 . 00 i ' ve ever spent , no need to pay 60 . 00 for a simple watch to run with . i ' m sure i ' ll upgrade one day to a gps watch with all the bells and whistles but this one is great . i even find myself wearing it to work during the week . 
i agree with the other reviews to buy a size larger . they have an awkward cut to them . they are very tight around the hips which , to me , defeats the point of buying sweatpants . these are not comfortable to wear and have no stretch to them . i have other pair of russell sweats that are 3xl and fit me fine which is why i went ahead and made this purchase . it appears that the sizing has changed and they are of lesser quality so if you ' re buying these based on previous russell purchases , i wouldn ' t recommend these . they have downgraded in quality big time . i do not recommend these whatsoever . update : these are the most poorly made sweats i ' ve ever worn . the stitching is very weak . 2 pair of them had the exact same issue of the seam at the crotch developing a hole in them after the first wear with light use only . i have joe boxer sweatpants that i have had for 8 years and they have yet to rip , tear , or have any other defect in workmanship . besides the fading of the black fabric , the sweats are still in very good condition . compare that to the russell sweats that i paid 3x more for than the joe boxers . update 2 : every single pair of these i bought ripped at the seams of either the crotch , pockets , or both after 1 wear . 
ordinarily , i wouldn ' t bother to write an amazon review for sweatpants . ordinarily , the occasion simply wouldn ' t warrant such a measure . but , i am living large because of these sweatpants . coming home to a cold house never felt better , because i know these sweatpants are going to be there , waiting for me . i get home with cold legs , put these on , and boom - - my reality is altered . another reviewer noted that these sweatpants have white pockets . yes , they do , but i can forgive that ; my keys and wallet prefer the soft white ambiance . these are powerful sweatpants . 
shrank way faster then expected on cold wash . still , love myself some russell ' s , i guess i may have grown a ton since the last set . . . 
my son is very tall , and thin . he needs navy sweat pants for pe uniform at school and i haven ' t had much luck finding the right size . most brand ' s boy sizes are far too short , and most men ' s sizes are far too large . these are a bit loose - fitting , but not bad at all and the length was perfect . i cannot say how they hold up to washings as we just got them . 
these sweatpants look and feel nice but are too short for a 5 ' 8 & # 34 ; teenage boy . he has to wear them low on his waist to fit for now . 
these pants are a tad bit smaller than i thought but it ' s all good because in winter you don ' t want your clothes flapping around anyway . i wear them all the time while running now . 
i am a fan of sweats . these are very fine . nice material . . . good pockets and all around just what i needed . 
the first pair of these that i bought had a 2 " long hole in the leg along the seam . i returned them . the second pair turned up with a hole in the crotch after about 35 days . the sewing of these sweatpants is not on a par with the quality of the material . i like the color and the feel of the cloth . these are very comfortable sweatpants . i sewed the hole instead of going through the hassle of another return - - although i ' d like to add that my returns through amazon are always a breeze . i ' ll keep these , but what a pity when a five - star item gets reduced to two stars because of the poor quality of overseas craftsmanship . a couple of notes : one reviewer said there is not much elastic in the waistline . i didn ' t find that to be true . another reviewer said these were a bit snug . i didn ' t find that the case , either . i like these sweatpants . they are very comfortable in feel and fit . i usually wear large and i ordered large . i ' m 5 ' 8 " , and i imagine these would fit someone up to at least 6 ' tall as well , as the legs are long ; this doesn ' t bother me , as they have elastic around the ankles . 
my husband has needed more sweatpants for years and refused to give up the old ones ; however , he seems happy with these . i have not washed them yet and hope they don ' t shrink badly . i will update if any issues . 
i followed the size guide and ordered a pair for my husband . it was way too small for him . . . i would say the sizes run small , so if you like them to be a little roomy , order a size up from what the chart says . 
i ordered 4 pair for camping . . my honey and i wear the same size . . great product . . well made . . no shringage when washed . i would buy again . 
i used to buy these all the time but i think i ' m done . the point of manufacture keeps changing ( india , pakistan and who knows where ) . the quality of stitching and even the material itself is not as good as before . you may or may not get a decent quality pair . the quality control is definitely hit or miss . 
i bought two pair of these after reading a reviewer ' s comment for another brand that was a couple of dollars cheaper . in it , she said that the other brand was made of tee shirt thin material . i didn ' t want that . these are not . they are made of a quality thickness , and at just a couple of dollars more , well worth it . i will say , however , that i made a mistake in ordering large after someone indicated that these run small . i ' m 190 lbs , 5 ' - 11 & # 34 ; and usually wear a size 34 waist in jeans . i don ' t like snug sweats . still , i should have ordered mediums . the large are too large ( waist and inseam ) . i ' m sure med would have been fine . but they ' re comfortable for around the house , and i like that they have pockets . oh , and for some reason , the grey color shipped free but they wanted i think $ 7 or $ 9 to ship blue . go figure . 
these are a perfect weight for my dad and fit just fine . he says they are comfortable and hopefully will wash well . i ' ll repost if they do not . 
these sweats are comfortable and just what i needed . they replaced a 10 year old pair of sweats that had lots of holes in them . these are slimmer than i was used to so they kind of look like & # 34 ; skinny sweats & # 34 ; instead of baggy sweats . 
i got these to wear out at the barn in ugly weather . the pants are very soft inside and out and they ride well when shoveling stalls and tossing around bales of hay - no twisting etc with ackward movements . they are pretty warm and the fabric is thicker than the el cheapo no name sweatpants from the local big box discount store . after three washings in warm water , they have not shrunk and that is a good thing . and the pockets are big enough to hold a samsung galaxy note phone easily . i ' ll buy these again . 
i buy for my husband you simply cannot wear out russell the material is excellent ! buy your husband or grandson perhaps a pair today ! i promise they will love them ! know the old saying you get what you pay for ? well it is true i bought him a pair cheaper once and i will never do again as they drew up ! you won ' t regret it i promise ! 
best sweats i have ever owned . russell definitely knows what they are doing with sweats . when i come home and want to get comfortable , these sweats are exactly what the doctor ordered . also good sweats to go on runs in . 0 complaints from this satisfied customer . 
fuzzy , soft , and more versatile accoutrement than pajamas . these are my favorite cool - weather sweats . oddly , this old - fashioned , reliable style has become difficult to obtain in local shops , which have the misguided idea that all folks want is clingy yoga - fashion . some of us prefer these classics . highly recommended for all body types ! 
best sweats on the market . their whisk away is great . i ' m ordering another pair today . probably blue or maybe another black . great fit 
these are well - made and good quality . i got the sizing wrong so had to return them and the size neede was no longer in stock , but will buy again if they come back in the right size . 
the pants were very long . but the waist and stuff were small . maybe more suited for a female . 
like the closed bottom , expandable waist , and the light grey color . lightweight and fit as requested is very satisfactory and as requested . 
my husband loves these sweats . they are lightweight and very comfortable and were perfectly sized . i would highly recommend these and the price is right ! 
i needed some sweats to sleep in when i go camping so i bought these . they fit great , have pockets which is nice , and the elastic is snug without being uncomfortable . the elastic is clutch because i don ' t want my warm air escaping when ever i move . great quality for the price too . i would recommend these to anyone looking for a casual pair of sweats . 
i bought two pair of these to wear around the house most of the time . they are medium weight & # 8211 ; not too hot and not too cold , with good elastic at the bottom of the legs to close well around the ankles . 
i was born in the mid - 1950 ' s so i find the sizing on clothes & shoes seems a bit off from the ' old ' days when i was growing up . i ordered these pants in 3xl but trust me , the cut & feel was more like xl . also a little on the thin side fabric wise . 
very nice and soft sweats to wear around the house . these sweat pants were very reasonable priced too , so that ' s good . 
i was looking for sweats for my bf & read a review from someone else who purchased these . based on his review , i purchased them and i am so glad . these sweats are nice and heavy and soft ! 
i just received my sweat pants today and am somewhat pleased with them . in the past i have not had any problems purchasing a men ' s large in pants , i am 6 ' 0 tall and weigh around 180 lbs and have a slender athletic build . however , these pants were a little tight in the seat and crotch area but the inseam was perfect . overall i ' m satisfied with my purchase since they were only about $ 16 so my expectations were not extremely high to begin with . they will work fine for just lounging around . they are very comfortable and not too heavy or too light . i would recommend that if your around my build and want a little extra room in the seat that you look at going a size up as these will shrink some over time . 
very comfortable for wearing around the house . could be a little bigger but i will manage , need to lose weight anyway lol . 
got the xl and hubby is 6 3 - about 210 lbs . they fit perfect and the pockets are the perfect addition . 
excellent quality . very satisfied with this product and the fit is exactly what i had in mind . i will buy more . 
first off i know these are guys sweats and i ' m a female but i ' ve always like the baggy sweeat pants look but they don ' t have that in womens so i got it in mens small . i love them there soft warm and the pockets are so deep ( : 
their ok . . . bt i found that my right pocket was sewed to my inseam . . . lol . . . . not cool . . . . i separated with a scissor so its ok now . . . . but not what i expected . i use them because it would of been a headache for me to send them back . . . . i use them at the gym . . . its ok . . . . but i expect better 
i prefer russell athletic products . their products are made heavier than other brands and made well . i am pleased with their products . 
i admit im a big man . 46 inch gut 29 inch inseam . you would think that xl would fit me , but these pants have no room in size xl in the seat and the thighs . sweatpants are supposed to be big and baggy , these are not . russell is a good brand , very durable pants . i have worn them in the past for many years , ive never needed anything but xl . they do have a tendency to shrink after repeted wash / dry cycles , but still the fabric used will last a long time . someone should tell the sizing department at russell inc xl means big and baggy in the seat and thighs . im hoping xxl will fit , sweatpants for me are a must have all the time . 
these russell athletic men ' s dri - power fleece pocket sweatpants have been my favorites for many many years . there very comfortable and good looking . they fit right and the last long . i have been buying them for years and i am very satisfied . 
these sweats are great . they are nice and soft . these are not lightweight sweats . they are so comfortable ! i own several pair in various colors and wear them constantly as they are great for casual wear . the drawstring is designed in such a way that it will not get lost . they have a closed , elastic bottom . the waist , of course , is also elastic . these sweatpants are a good buy . 
i bought these based on the 4 & 5 star reviews . however , they are not thick & warm like some people say they are , 11oz & up are thicker & warmer . these look like i could buy them at a local discount retail store . i turn these inside out when i wash but after a 4 - washes , i noticed they started pilling . these are not & # 34 ; high & # 34 ; quality & are made of a cheap cotton base . if you don ' t care about the pilling & just using them around the house or in the yard , i ' d say go for it . however , i can get the same ones , different brand that will pill at my local retail stores for less $ $ . the elastic waist fits as expected . the bottom of the legs are also elastic & are comfortable around the ankles . one other thing that i do like , is the pockets are actually deep & come partially up my arm , about a third of the way . 
it is difficult to find sweat pants that have pockets , elasticized cuffs , fit well , and are comfortable . these fit the bill on all counts . also a good value for the money . 
we have purchased these pants before and they are very comfortable and durable . my husband wears them when he is doing indoor household repairs . 
good running pants for moderatly cold weather , have held up well so far . nicely made and nice material for the price . 
these are very thick - so good for cold weather - not so good for hot weather . seem well made . 
these pants must have looked great since they were stolen from my gym locker less than 20 minutes after opening the package and trying them on . . . . love the product , hate the thief 
so i ordered these in hopes of getting some good around the house sweat pants , theyre sized closer to 2 sizes smaller then on the label when compared to unbranded or hanes products of the same size . so being an amazon prime customer i was easily able to return them , but they charged half the price of a pair of the pants as a " restock " fee , i dont know if they do this for every order returned or just me , because i had to remove the pants from the plastic bag to try them on . needless to say i will not attempt to get a larger size of these pants from them since if they dont fit right i will be eating most of the cost in return fees . 
this is a very attrative watch that isn ' t too small or too bulky . my husband really likes the flix feature and the dual times that can be set . 
i ' ve had this ironman watch for approximately 10 years . so why am i compelled to write a review now ? because i just received a superior service from timex that warrants a write - up . after 10 years of faithful service the wrist band on this watch came off on one side . i looked up where i can find a replacement and found that timex will replace the band on its watches for free . i called the 800 number and sure enough , they told me to package it up , write a note that it is for band replacementonly , told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me . this was four weeks ago , and my watch just arrived back in superio shape . new band , and the back looks shinier . lookslike they cleaned its exterior as well . i owned several timex watches in the past , but this one has been my favorite . 1 ) i like the nice clear large display . easy to see even with my now presbyopic eyes . 2 ) setting the watch is easy without a manual3 ) there is enough useful features , but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4 ) even though it is a men ' s watch i a female who wear is and i don ' t find it heavy or bulky5 ) i like the plastic watch band . my previous timex had a velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did notclose well . and now that i found that timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back , i am even more pleased with it . 6 ) the battery lasts a reasonable time , i have to replace it every 2 - 3 years . not often enough to be annoying . thebattery in my " dressed - up " watch lasts only a year . i am very pleased with the watch , and now extremely pleased with the service as well . 
i ' ve owned 10 timex ironman watches since 1987 , and recently experienced a failure with a gift i gave my wife - the " custom " timex watchband dropped the watch and she looked down only 4 months after receiving her christmas present and it was gone forever ! ! since i ' ve owned so many of these watches i ' ve watched over the years as they made changes , but this generation of watches is a horrible mistake . first of all , it ' s been true that since the beginning of time , the cheap resin watchbands have been uncomfortable so everyone knows that when they break ( and they do break , after about 1 year , in general ) , you must purchase an aftermarket velcro watch band , or a leather band , or whatever blows your skirt up . . . i went to walmart last week looking to pick up 2 of these watches and demo ' ed them extensively ( one for my self and one for my poor watch - less wife ) , but then realized , what will i do when the watch band fails ? ? and the answer is : i ' ll be stuck paying $ 12 for another crappy resin proprietary band that timex ships with this watch . look at the photo . this watch doesn ' t use standard pins to mount the band . the space between the pins is too narrow . it ' s apparent to me that timex is trying to become the microsoft of watches ! i bought my wife a timex atlantis , and i recommend it highly to everyone . it has all the features of the ironman , and none of this b . s . about proprietary bands and watch faces that fall out . . . 
my son really enjoys this watch in terms of reliabilty and capability to use as a diving watch . he is very happy with this watch . 
great watch . i swim , run and bike . this watch goes from the trail to the pool and never skips a beat . 
i have purchased many timex watches over the years and i am entirely satisfied with this watch . i always buy the sports watch , as i swim and do triathlons . things i like about the watch : * setting the watch is easy and the instructions are clear ( although the printed instructions are very small ! ) * the watch is not too big . so many watches have too many features and they are large , bulky , and heavy . this watch is sleek , has a low profile , and has a size that is ideal for average needs . * the numbers are big enough to see easily at a glance . * there are enough useful options , and this watch is not overloaded with too many options . too many options are confusing to me . i like the simplicity of this watch and the ease of use of the options it has . * i like the plastic watch band . i have tried the velcro strap bands and they wear out after a year or so of use . the plastic band will eventually break , but is fairly easy to replace . * i like the price . at less than 35 dollars i have everything i need in a watch . * i like and use frequently the indiglo feature . i have even used indiglo to find my way to the bathroom at night from bed ! the light on the dial is bright enough to make your way through the dark for a short trip ! things i don ' t like : there is not much i don ' t like about this timex watch . i suppose my biggest complaint about this watch and any timex watch is the difficulty in changing the battery . the battery will eventually need replacement , and of course one has to take off the back of the watch to replace the battery . this is tricky and takes a steady hand . i wish timex would make the battery more accessible so changing the battery would be as easy as sliding one in or out of a hinged door ( like on a hearing aid ) . obviously , there is much more to like about this watch than not like . i do recommend it for a good sport watch . it will withstand chlorine pools , lake water , rainfall , high and low temperatures , but be careful not to scratch the dial window ! i scratched the main window crystal and ruined my last watch . avoid spraying any kind of bug repellant on the window as well , as this can mar ( dull ) the surface . for me , this watch meets all my needs and i give it a 5 - star rating . my needs are faily simple . there are certainly other watches that offer more features , but to me , the added features add complexity and are not worth the added bother . the price is good . the watch is good quality . this is a good buy . jim " konedog " koenig 
bought as a stocking stuffer . it came in a red box and was as described . he works outside in the elements so it seems like it is going to be good . for the price you can ' t beat it ! ! 
my husband is an emt and fireman so needed a watch like this . meets his needs perfectly and stands up to the abuse . looks better in person than in the picture too . i was a little worried at first , but this hasn ' t let him down ! 
i just wanted a nice , simple watch to wear as an everyday / non - dressy add - on and this watch works perfectly . easy to read , fairly simple to figure out and very comfortable . 
my wife wanted a simple watch that wouldn ' t draw too much attention when running in bueno aires . this watch does the trick and is easy to set up and fits well on her small wrist . 
i bought this watch in purple a couple of years ago after my nike watch died . i used it as my casual watch . it ' s great for pool or beach . it ' s also much easier to set than the nike one . you needed an engineering degree to figure it out . heaven help you if you accidentally push a button by accident . you ' d have to dig out the owner ' s manual to figure out how to get the time back . not so , with this one . i recently ordered the charcoal / pink one and gave the purple watch to my daughter . highly recommend ! 
i bought this watch for my daughter and niece . one is a swimmer , the other a runner , so both of them have needs that a normal watch don ' t meet ( sweat / water / lap timing etc . ) . my daughter has worn hers non - stop since christmas morning , it doesn ' t get better than that does it ? 
i ' m a runner , and a biker , and a teacher , and i needed a watch and timer for all of these things . this watch does the job very well . sure , it ' s not the most fashionable watch in the world ( a nine year old boy once said , " cool watch " , and then showed me he had the same one ) , but i think it ' s unobtrusive and the grey color is very neutral . it ' s about $ 6 cheaper on amazon than at walmart . i ' ve actually purchased three of these , two i gave to students who needed them for summer camps . it ' s durable and reliable . 
this is a simple little watch that is fantastic . i wore it during my last marathon and it was light and perfect . i ran my fastest marathon yet ! if you are looking for a fancy watch , this is the wrong item . it won ' t tell you how far you have gone or give you your heart rate . it tells time and has a timer . 
i hate when i go to type a review and something goes wrong . you see , i hate when i press the submit review button and discover that my internet service was down while busy writing a review because it means my review isn ' t there when i get back online ( after hitting the refresh button ) . this just happened to me and it really stinks . it means re - typing the review . ugh ! ! ! this is very annoying and occurs frequently . anyway this red - colored watch for women is a worthy investment . the batteries last a really long time , maybe even years , and with the economy jacking up prices left and right for a variety of items these days , you can ' t go wrong with an affordable and always dependable wrist watch . it can even get wet and still work perfectly fine . 
this is a great little watch for the price . i wear it all the time , and i use the running / exercise features on occasion . the watch does exactly what it promises so if you want more complex features than you need to buy something more extravagant . i think it is great for daily use and it is most certainly durable . 
i bought these watches for my wife to wear to work . she says they feel good and work fine but not sure how long they will last . fairly cheaply made but that ' s why they are cheaply priced . 
this watch is very nice for the price . it is was just what i was looking for . the size is perfect for my wrist ( my wrists are small ) , the band is smooth and it is very light . the color is nice as well . it says black but i think it is more of a darker gray , which i was hoping for . i did have a problem setting the minutes , i can not set them exactly but maybe that is operator error . i wanted a watch and stop watch and this is perfect . 
cheap and time worthy bought it for teenagers that want to wear it in the sea . got one for myself too 
short and sweet : i ' ve been buying the 1440 model in all kinds of forms over the years and i can say that they take a beating in and out of the kitchen . these guys just perform , so i got one for my wife on her bike rides . . . . hope this helps ! 
not a big watch person but use this for timing myself in the gym and its really a great watch . i actually wear it for work now too because its cute and comfortable . i have small wrists and it actually has a setting which fits with no spinning . love it ! 
got my 12 year old daughter this sports watch as a gift and she is immensely happy with it ! she ' s an active 12 year old who goes to the beach a lot and so far its working perfectly ! 
i continue to buy this watch . love the timer and stop watch function , holds up great through an active job and the gym . i never take it off and havent had a problem . eventually the band breaks but its still a fantastic watch 
came on time - fits well works well not much else i can think to say 
i needed a watch to wear over the summer for the pool and this watch fit the bill . it ' s nice looking and durable . it also has a light which comes in handy . although inever figured out how to set the alarm , it ' s ok because i don ' t need it . i justlove the look of this watch and for the money , it ' s a good deal . 
got the watch to wear when working out , or in the yard , or whatever casual setting needed , and it is fabulous ! ! love the pink . am planning to order another color . and as always timex and amazon are the greatest ! ! ! 
my daughter loves her watch . she wear it everyday . since i gave this to her she nit wearing her other watches anymore . thank you . and im pretty sure i will buy more watches again here in amazon . . . 
i got this for my son . of all ~ 12 timex ironman watches i have owned in my lifetime , this has the very stiffest buttons . they leave a red mark on your fingers when you finally push hard enough to operate them ! ! ! i won ' t even bother to set this watch for my son , i ' ll only touch it if i need to turn off the alarm at 4 : 00 am . the worst user interface of all my timex watches . it ' s good if you don ' t plan to push the buttons ! ! ! 
this is a great watch . i ' ve had it for several years and its never lost a second ! it looks neat and the functions are remarkable for a watch this inexpensive ! 
i ' ve had this for about a month . have been in light rain and it still works . i wouldn ' t take it swimming . it works fine . great to take on vacation especially in a plane when you want to know what time it is but your cell phone is turned off . my husband sets it for me since i have little patience for that kind of thing . he doesn ' t seem to have a problem with it . i don ' t expect it to last for a long time . i guess i have low expectations and with a watch that costs only $ 13 . 50 i think that ' s a good thing . i do recommend it . 
the watch looks far more expensive than it is ! i bought it as a present and my wife was very very happy , never even noticed it was a more affordable watch and she is using it for the gym and we went to the hotsprings and jogging she went in the hot pools with it and it works just fine ! only delta is that is very small so if you are a lady with thick wrists it will look very very small , otherwise it ' s a total keeper ! 
i wear this watch everyday no matter what i am wearing . it is just the right size for my small wrist . most watches look to large not this one . the display is easy to read and of course the indiglo is a bonus . just a follow up on the review that i originally gave . the watch is still going strong and i love it . it is a perfect fit for those of us who have small wrists . great watch . 
it works very well for the price ! the numbers are to smell for me and i can ' t read them without my glasses 
this is a great watch . waterproof from swimming in rivers and showers . kept it on most of the time . easy to switch time zones . a good alarm and stopwatch . easy to use watch . the paint easily chipped off the front - but i was also doing a lot of labor with it on . but it made it around the world and it is still my main watch today about almost 2 years of use . 
i wear this watch to work everyday and it helps so much ! i work outside and have to be physical at times and works great ! 
you get what you pay for . timex make some great watches ; this isn ' t one of them . very limited as far as features go . it ' s good - looking , but not what i ' m used to as far as watches go . i purchased it for my girlfriend . she likes it , but i ' m disappointed in the features and quality . i ' m only giving it 4 - stars because i knew it was cheap when i bought it . 
it ' s a watch , it ' s a stopwatch , it can light up . this is all i needed it to do , and it does it well . worth the money ! 
this little watch is so good that this is my third ! they never quit working and i like different colors ! these are so inexpensive that if they get too messed up with my job . . . . . . i can throw them away ! i keep three in my drawer at all times . they keep accurate time and i have never had one stop working . they are tough and dependable . . . . try one . . . . you will not be sorry ! 
loving this watch . i got it because of the great reviews and price . i have been using it at the gym and am very happy with it . 
may not have all the bells and whistles of some running watches , but is great and very easy to use while on the move . 
the watch is attractive , with nice features like a timer and a stopwatch . it also has a second time zone that one can set , an alarm , an hourly chime , day / date / seconds showing on the face . it is not difficult to set . the backlight helps a lot since numeric - display watches are inherently more difficult to read than regular face watches . my biggest disappointment is that i cannot hear the alarm and hourly chime , due to my own hearing problems . the pitch and volume of the chime make it impossible for me to hear . maybe when i get a hearing aid , i will be able to hear it . 
the watch face hasnt scratched yet . she wears it all the time . & # 34 ; simple not complicated & # 34 ; good quality for the price . 
i bought this for starting middle school and it helped me keep travk of time . i love this watch and its timex and was a great deal for 16 when i got it 
perfect for me . cheep , stylish , strong , waterproof . great for everyday use . i love the pink and gray . very easy to use and would buy it again . 
i needed something inexpensive that tells time . this watch is attractive , and the band is long enough for my somewhat larger wrist . so far it ' s keeping time , and the controls are easy to use . my only quarrel is that if i pick it up at night to see the time , chances are only 50 - 50 that i ' ll get it right side up and hit the light button - if i pick it up upside down , i ' ve changed the display from a 12 hour clock to 24 . but that ' s a minor irritation . 
i bought this watch because i am out on the golf course a lot and i also walk and run daily . hardly know that i have it on . 
the price and some nice , but " temporary " features is what gives this watch 2 stars . other than that it would have to be " 0 " . i know for $ 12 . 92 what can one expect in a watch , but after having and wearing this watch for 3 months , the display went totally bye - bye ! totally gone , totally useless ! it is suppose to be water - resistant , but apparently not fog - resistant . this watch was never under water in any way , in the bathtub or shower , but it would fog under the crystal display when in high humidity weather or from hanging over the kitchen sink while doing dishes , etc . , and i mean well above the sink and it would still fog considerably under the crystal display . so , i ' m not sure what they mean by water - resistant , because it is not . can ' t imagine how long it would have lasted if i actually had it under water . so , this has been my second timex sports watch in less than a year , and both have given up electronically . not a good track record in my book , and definitely not even worth the $ 12 . 95 . i guess unless timex feels $ 12 . 92 and three months to disposal , which is the case with this watch . 
i bought this for my 10 year old daughter to take to the pool . she can wear it in the water without any problems . she loves it , it ' s girlie yet functional . the timer and alarms are easy to use and now she times everything : ) 
i am highly satisfied with this purchase ! take my review with a grain of salt - i merely purchased this watch to be able to tell time while i play with my preschooler in conditions involving everything from water to mud to paint , and playdough . i don ' t use it for laps or long runs , although the indiglo function is nice for my morning jogs . the watch was easy to set and it cleans up nicely after finger - painting days . all in all , a great buy ! 
very pretty and functional . great price for such a nice watch . sure it is " feminine " due to it ' s color ( pink ) , but it ' s slightly too big for my liking ( i prefer really small , petite , feminine - looking watch ) . overall i ' m quite satisfied with the product . 
i had been buying similar watches at walmart . . . but this is sooooo much nicer . it ' s very functional with alarm , two time zones , lighted display , , waterproof , and not as large as most watches that are this style - which i really like ! definitely would buy again ! 
i bought this for my girlfriend as a random gift , i just wanted to give her something different . she loves it ! 
i purchased this to replace the timex i had for many years - the wristband broke and would have cost more to replace than to buy a new watch . i particularly like this watch for indiglo . i have a young son that still wakes during the night and i like to just tap the button to see the time . i read other reviews that indicated that the buttons were difficult to push , but i had no problem and my toddler also likes to push the buttons for the beep so if he can do it , i think an adult should be able to also . 
this is a good watch for the price , i used it for my work as a nurse and it is very durable and you can wipe it down to disinfect it because the whole thing is plastic . 
for ~ $ 15 dollars this is a nice watch . it has a nice display ( a little small ) with the time , date , seconds and day of the week along with a good light . it is pretty basic but a good buy if you are just looking for a simple sports watch . i bought this watch along with the timex women ' s t5k020 ironman triathlon 30 - lap resin band watch . that watch is about double the price of this watch but is far superior . it has a larger and easier to read display , more functions , a comfortable band that fits to your wrist , and it much easier to set and more durable . there are a few things i do not like about this watch . this watch was rather difficult to set ( i have never had trouble setting a timex watch before ) partly because the buttons are very small and difficult to maneuver and that it was also very confusing . the display is also small compared to other timex watches . the main thing i do not like about this watch is the band . the band is rather cheap and flimsy and not made out of the most comfortable material . it does not fit / conform very nicely to your wrist making the watch rather uncomfortable . the other watch i mentioned above has a far nicer band . overall i give this 4 / 5 stars for the price for a sports watch . i would like to put emphasis on the fact that this watch is very basic . if you plan to use this for intense athletics / triathlons / races etc . i ' d highly recommend the other watch i have mentioned here which is an excellent watch . 
i bought this watch primarily for running / working out so that i could use the stopwatch feature . the watch arrived quickly and is exactly what i have been looking for . the watchband is very comfortable on my wrist , even while sweating during a workout . the face of the watch is not too big to where it looks huge on my wrist , but still large enough to easily read the display . i like how it has a seconds counter showing when you have it set to just show the time . allows for easy minute interval training or checking heart rate without having to use the actual stopwatch . even that is easy with just a touch of the button . i find myself wearing the watch all the time now ! have taken it swimming in the pool , ocean , shower etc with no problems . very satisfied with this purchase . 
i was once one of those dastardly young people who didn ' t own a watch , and used my phone as a clock . come to find out ( and rightly so ) constantly checking your phone even if it is to check the time , is utterly rude in social situations . so i bought this awesome watch and now i no longer suffer hateful stares or inpatient grumbling from friends . the battery has been long - lasting and the functions are just what i needed . 
just short of two years and suddenly this watch has little water droplets inside the dial . it worked great until now . i used to swim with it on for a year . yesterday i went for a regular swim and ended up with water inside the dial . can ' t see the time on it anymore . too bad : - ( update : i opened the watch ( thanks to 4 tiny screws on the back panel and only 3 convenient components inside ) , wiped the water off , greased the rubber o - ring with chapstick and put it back together . good as new ! 
this is perfect for someone looking for a basic watch . i ' m outdoorsy and don ' t usually like wearing watches because of them catching on sleeves and such , but this is almost small enough to avoid that . my favorite things are that you have easy buttons , modes , and that the hourly alarm can be turned off , which was a major selling point for me ( i hate beeping watches in classrooms or meetings . . . ) the color isn ' t too bold , either , which is perfect because i ' m generally not a pink kind of girl . 
i was looking for an inexpensive watch to swim with as i was wearing a tag and felt the chlorine wasn ' t real good for it . the price was great and have seen them in retail stores for 3 to 4 times more . it is easy to read and exactly what i wanted . 
i like the relatively large face on this watch and the pink accents on the silver face , which add a touch of femininity to the watch . it is easy to set , especially if you ' ve had another digital watch . the stopwatch works well , and i really like the indiglo light . the only reason i didn ' t give it 5 stars is that the timer is useless . there is no " reset " button for the timer so you have to cycle through the minutes and seconds back to zero to reset . this is very annoying . however , i don ' t use a timer very often so it really doesn ' t affect the functionality of the watch for me . for the price , and if you don ' t use a timer , this is a good choice . 
i work in a prison and needed an inexpensive watch to keep track of rounds and other shift duties . this watch is easy to use and functions well . the alarm and time set are simple . chimes are audible , but not overly loud . having the ability to display date and military time ( used at work ) is so convenient . 
i am a big fan of timex ladies watches , i was hoping that i could swap the band out with my ladies ironman watch , but they are not exactly the same size , but i still love the watch . 
i just got this watch and like it so far . only drawbacks are that i can ' t figure out all of the buttons yet but i am sure i will in time . also it looks a little odd to me paired with my yellow gold rings . sort of doesn ' t match with them . other than that it is a nice substantial watch that seems to be well made and doesn ' t look cheap at all . 
the young lady who received this watch as a gift is enjoying the watch . it was the correct type and color for her age . 
this is a very functional and attractive watch . it keeps great time and has easy to read numbers . just right size , not too big & not too small . 
this box makes it nice to keep all my rings in one place . yet small enough to put in a drawer or takes up little space in the safe . wish i would of bought one sooner 
i just got several new rings from a really good store , the rings were expensive and they are huge . also i alredy had some rings i made overseas and it does not matter the size , this case can take care them all . really well made , lots of cushion and it comes with key which i dont use because they are in my safe but great item . 
very nice . holds many rings . arrived fairly fast . excellent for men or women rings . nice price . grab on for a gift 
this is great for my wide band rings ! outside is like a smooth grain black leather - not sure what material is but it looks like leather - ish material . inside lining is felt and the foam padded slots allow you to put really wide band rings . i just bought my second one this company ( caddy bay collection ) and am happy . only complaint is that i wish they gave the option to have delivered to a po box as it is very difficult to get my packages via ups . the reason i don ' t give it 5 stars is because the quality is just fine but not expensive quality and i feel like it is just a bit over - priced .
