when i received they had a bit of a scuffed finish in a couple of places but i was able to rub most of it out . i wore them without socks and they were very comfortable . this says a lot coming from a primarily running shoe wearer . i accidentally spilled a drop of soup on them the first time i wore them and they immediately stained but i was able to get most of it out just cleaning with water . i have since ordered saddle soap to clean them with but haven ' t tried it yet . i have the linen oat color . i love them now but i think i will love them even more in the spring and summer . i haven ' t worn loafers since high school but i ' m enjoying these so far ! 
if you want the wayyy cool look these are the shoes to have , great casual style for jean , shorts or just hanging out in . my grandaughter has at least 4 pair & i have some myself . i like the leather and the plaid are very easy to match to anything . sperry ' s are the most comfortable you can get in a casual shoe , look high end & priced right if you buy from amazon . go for it , you ' ll love them , get more than a couple of pair in different colors . great to shop in . 
these were a christmas gift for my grand daughter . shed been wanting a pair for awhile and she loves them . they are quite comfortable . they lead me to buy a pair for myself only i got the moccasin style so great 
usually i would never buy shoes this expensive , but i am sooo glad i did . these shoes are extremely well made and are going to last a long time ( unlike my other crappy shoes like toms , flats , etc ) . they add a hint of masculinity to my wardrobe ( not too much ) . i recommend wearing them with skinny jeans and a sweater . so cute ! they are really comfy to wear if you ' ll be walking around for a long time . although , i recommend breaking them in first before going on long excursions . i didn ' t , and it resulted in a couple painful blisters , due to my stupidity . i usually wear a 7 . 5 or 8 , but i got a 7 and they fit perfectly . and most importantly : they were approved by the boyfriend . yay ! 
classic and comfortable . they ' ve worn pretty well and definitely get more comfortable once you ' ve broken them in . i bought them to slip on and off my feet while recovering from hip surgery , which prevented me from bending past 90 degrees , so they were a life save - especially in slippery conditions ! 
these sperry top - siders are comfy , cool , casual . . . just the type of thing you ' d like to sink your toes into ! now all i need is a yacht to go with these wonderful boating shoes . the customer service from peltz famous brand shoes shows why they are so famous . . . exceptional , courteous , stellar service . do yourself a favor . buy these shoes ! 
sperry ' s are the best . my kids love them and have several pairs a piece . the go with just about any outfit year around . 
these look and fit great right out of the box . they fit true to size unlike most of the athletic shoes which i buy a half size larger . very comfortable shoe . i am sure i will live in theses and my teva ' s this summer . 
these shoes are nice quality . i got 9m . . they are a bit narrow so they aren ' t the most comfortable for me , but they are very nice shoes . they look great . i thought they didn ' t have ties due to the picture but they do . . the leather laces are good at staying tied . 
this shoe is a great fit for me and seems to be very well made . seems to require a little break in time . 
although these shoe covers look like all the others out there , as a realtor , i ' d say this is false advertising to call them " large " , and amazon doesn ' t seem to offer an " extra large " option . mostly women and children were able to fit these on their shoes , but not men , so they aren ' t of much use at my open houses . com ' n amazon ! read all the reviews and amp up the sizing option . 
i have light carpet and we use these over our shoes ( and for guests ) , if shoes are not removed first before entering our home . they can be tossed in a load of clothes for washing too . i would recommend . 
i own a dog waste ( poop ) removal service in deland , florida . i use the covers over my shoes to prevent contamination when i go from yard to yard . the covers hold up well , even when i walk on wet grass . i am pleased with them and will re - order . 
excellent value and saves from having to constantly spot clean my carpet from those that choose not to remove their shoes . this is well worth the effort and it makes less work for me ! 
use these when going into clients homes and they work great . they keep the shoes covered and the floors clean which clients love . 
i live in nh and we frequently get snow and ice . i walk the dog before going to work , and i have a need to go back upstairs to get her kong and make coffee in my travel mug . well , after i ' ve just been outside walking through snow and ice , i don ' t want to have to unlace my boots to run upstairs for two minutes and have to put them back on . problem solved ! i wear a size 6 women ' s boot and while i have plenty of room in these , i am concerned about my husband putting these on his 10 . 5 shoes . i ended up also buying a size xl and i ' m quite glad that i did so that we ' re both able to run upstairs if we forget something . oh , and since i ' m putting them on for mere minutes , i am able to reuse these a few times to get extra mileage out of them . 
we were always faced with dirt and grime carried in on the soles of peoples shoes on our hardwood floors . to stop this , we bought these shoe covers and our guests love them as much as we do . they don ' t have to take off their shoes when walking on our floors anymore and the anti - skid is a plus with hardwood floors . 
if you ' re like me and remove your shoes when you enter your house , this product is for you . inevitably , you will always have knuckle - draggers who leave their shoes on inside their own house and think it ' s ok to do the same in yours . well , that ' s where the shoe covers come into play ! this is a good product that you can use to bridge the gap between us civilized folks who remove their shoes upon entry into a house and the mouth - breathers who insist on wearing their disgusting poop and gum soiled shoes inside . 
i bought this because i wanted to fill it with socks and shoe covers . i want to give my guess options when i want them to help keep my floors clean . 
i bought these so i don & # 8217 ; t ruin new carpets in open houses i host for my clients . they work very well and make my clients feel that much more satisfied with my professionalism ! pros : these slip easily over my large ( size 13 shoes ) ! the create an easy and effective barrier between shoes and carpet . great for dirty shoes ! cons : they dont protect from mud and water . ( well dont seam like they would ) just so you know : i am a realtor in the boise idaho market we do not get much rain . a great product for the use i have at a great price . thank you a + + 
i bought these to put over my bare feet at the airport . i don ' t think they would work over extra large shoes , however i do believe they would fit most size bare feet . 
our employees use these daily and their feedback about durability was great . only negative , they run a bit small . i ' m reordering today . 
to protect my new carpet after i make short trips in side the condo building i wear these in stead of changing shoes all the time . the do a great job of keeping the dirt out of the unit . 
works as it should , cheap so it doesn ' t break the bank . in cleveland snow . my guys used it on a new carpet and it was perfect 
very disappointed with these covers . they do not fit size 11 well . i previously purchased one pair of shoe covers at lowes or home depot ( can ' t recall ) however they were a good fit especially for men with work boots . they lasted several months also until i decided to throw them out for looking really soiled . i ' ll keep these but will need to purchase a larger size elsewhere . 50 pair under $ 11 . 00 is good , however the one pair i bought previously was about $ 2 . 00 + tax and was reused for a few months . 
my wife is a clean freak so these are perfect for slipping over work shoes while doing renivations and work around the house . great for guests who don ' t like to take off their shoes or repairmen working at the house . they keep dirt / sand / whatever off the hardwoodfloors and carpet . i keep a box in the kitchen cabinete for those unexpected times 
we keep these at the door and if we have contractors in the house ask them to cover their shoes . they dont have to take off shoes , our wood floors & carpet stay nice and clean . it fits just about all shoes , there was one person who had a size 11 men and it was a tight fit but it stil fit . 
this is handy to have around when people like plumbers come . this can be used instead of having to ask them to remove their shoes . or , for yourself , for that matter to avoid tracking in dirt and mud from outside . it is a thin paper - like material , but it is pretty strong and lasts all day through repeated on / off . just toss at the end of the job or when dirty . 
i keep these in the front closet for people that need to come in and don ' t want or can ' t take off their shoes . helps keep the carpet clean . i have had some issues getting them on my shoes , i wear a 12 and they are a little small for bulky boots and running shoes . 
these fit fine over shoes / boots / snow boots to keep dirty shoes from soiling the carpet . the only bad thing is that snow and ice sometimes come through them and onto the floor . they work decently , though . 
these booties are the worst piece of junk that i have ever seen , they split before one can barely put them on over their shoes . this was really a waste of my money and this was my second order . i never received the first one or got my money back from that first order . i will never order anything else from this cheesy company . i rate them a half star . 
i bought these cause i go looking at houses to buy and they keep my shoes covered so i don ' t have to walk around a strangers home in my stocking or bare feet , , , great fit , , i don ' t slip around like the cloth ones great price thanks 
these tear really easily . i feel like i shouldn ' t complain because they are really affordable , but . . . . they probably work well for indoor use . i just wanted something to keep the mud and animal droppings out of the treads of my shoes , and they do that ok . but they do tear and leak , so don ' t count on them for protection from wet . 
at 1st i thought the color wasn ' t as vibrant but it has this pretty lace pattern which redeems it in that regard . i am 5 ' 9 , a 34 c & 127 lbs & if you like the look of the laces exposing some of your skin in the back then the item is true fit . usually with corsets , you ' re supposed to size down but in this case i would order my true size or size up . we tightened it up without any problems & i like that the laces are into 2 seperate pieces because it makes adjusting the top & bottom parts eaiser . all hook & eye corsets are difficult to fasten because the hooks wanna keep coming undone as you fasten them . also , all top portions of corsets from my experience are hard to fill out nicely & get good cleavage unless you have really big boobs or breast implants . the reason for 4 stars is that you see stomach skin between the eyelets when you fasten it up all the way even if the item isn ' t fitting tight . usually , in well made corsets there is a flap of fabric on the inside that is supposed to cover the skin & hooks & eyes but i guess because it is * somewhat * reversible they left that off . because the skin of my back & a little on my stomach are exposed i would not wear it out of the house as a top like i wanted to do but my husband sure doesn ' t mind me wearin ' it in the house ! * wink wink * ; - ) 
this item was too long for me - i am about 5 ' 0 & # 34 ; , 120lbs , and this item was way too long for my torso . 
after searching for a corset to wear under my wedding dress and on my honeymoon i found this one and for the price decided to give it a try . it arrived well packaged and the item itself was great . sturdy construction that didn ' t look or feel like a costume and due to the double lining , it was really comfortable . it really holds you in and was fairly easy to tighten myself . the pink color is more of a dusky rose color with slightly shimmery detail and sexy black lace along the top , very nice and pretty . the all black reverse side wasn ' t really a go as the hooks are on the wrong side to fasten and i never was able to get it fastened in the front but perhaps i ' ll keep trying since the black side looks so great too . if you are small busted ( a or b cup ) you may have trouble filling this corset out even pulled at its tightest but i plan to use cup enhancers bought from the fabric store to add definition when worn under clothing . overall a great corset for the price and i look forward to wearing it for the wedding and honeymoon . 
sizing is accurate ! fit is perfect . with the pull string ties in the back , you don ' t have to struggle into or out of this corset . also , the front hooks are easy to manage both in and out as well . nice feel ! 
perfect ! ! ! i ordered this item a little larger and i was right to do so ! i like a little less back to show . a wonderful item ! 
this is a beautiful corset , well made and true to size if you understand how corsets are sized . measure your waist and subtract four inches for good fit . the corset has moderate boning and has sturdy construction for cinching . my only issue with it is that the cinching ribbons are too short , but if you spend a few dollars to replace them , it is a lovely , quality corset . here ' s a video showing how to properly put on and cinch a corset : [ . . ] btw , it is fully reversible , and the garters are removable . it ' s worth twice the asking price , and beautiful . 
it fit very well and looked very nice i love it and so did my boyfriend lol , great product really 
i ' m petite and in good shape but i have hips . i worry about boy shorts and bottoms that have extra ' material ' but these fit awesome . top is good for smaller busted women as well . doesn ' t come with choker but get one separate and it really makes the look ! 
unfortunately it did not fit so be cautious " one size " my girl is small and curvy not overweight at all she is 125 lbs and has curves so it came to tight . . . after closely looking at the girl in the pic she doesnt have hips like my girl this girl is " 6 oclock " ( staight up and down ) my girl is a 36c and the top looks very tight on her . i wish i had looked at all these aspects first . . . . gettin ready to contact the sender in reference to a refund . . . . i did order it on amazon ( lingerie diva ) and it showed up quickly though which is why i gave 3 stars 
this lingerie set is super sexy on fits perfectly on my girl . she has some great curves which are really accentuated when she puts this little number on . the quality is good but make sure you get the dreamgirl brand . . . if not than it is a knock - off ! 
i didn ' t realize until after i ordered , that i chose the red option . be careful when ordering because the pictures do not depict the actual color of item . regardless , the panty set is nice . the strappy look of the panties is very sexy . the top is a little awkward and takes a little bit to figure out how to put on , but it ' s sexy too . i have a d cup and feel like i have to be careful putting it over my head or else it will tear , so anything larger may want to think twice about ordering . 
i love this little flip flop , it has just a little arch support so i ' m not walking flat footed . i really like the straps , has just a little silver threading in the strap and the strap not so wide as to chaff the top of my feet . i really like these to wear to the pool and mailbox . 
love reef brand ! i am getting a white pair form my wedding reception ! very comfortaable and great support for your feet 
i love these so much . when my last pair died , i bought them here . when that pair dies , i ' ll buy more . i hope they never stop making them . 
but the sizes run small . i am usually a 7 but had to return the size 7 for an 8 . the 8 ' s fit wonderful and they are so comfortable . 
i usually go to old navy and just stock up on cheap flip flops . but i wanted something that would last longer than a season or two . these turned out to be just fine . they are padded enough that i think i ' ll get my money ' s worth out of them . i usually have trouble finding flip flops because i have a narrow foot , but these fit just fine , they ' re not sloppy and i don ' t feel like i ' m going to kick them off my feet . they have a little bit of a built up arch for extra support , the strap is pretty thin , but it works for what i want . 
i have been buying these sandals since i was in middle school . i have had 3 pairs in 15 years . i don ' t replace these flippers because they are worn out , it ' s because i lost the last pair . love love love these . great every day sandal . get them ! 
i have been wearing the reef flip flops with the thin band since 1998 . i love them . the thinner band that is soft and flat makes them super comfortable . these flip flops have an arch support in them , which is hard to find in a flip flop . the arch support combined with the soft band , makes you feel like you aren ' t wearing anything . plus , unlike other flip flops , which hardly have any sole grip and the bottom and can be slippery , these have a great textured sole . the textured sole makes them grip the ground better , so you ' re less likely to trip in slippery areas . they also last forever . 
i love these flip flops so much , i only wear reef . however , i find they run small so i had to order one size larger . they are very comfortable . 
love these sandals ! i have them in brown as well ! they are not only cute to where you can wear them dressy or casual but they are sooo comfortable ! 
i ' m a loyal flip - flop wearer , but spent many years in uncomfortable cheap ones that were completely impractical for walking everywhere around the city , and fell apart much too quickly . these flip - flops changed my outlook . they lasted through a long summer of daily wear without fading or collapsing . the ribbon - y thong is comfortable on the toes , there is just enough arch support to walk for hours , the foot pad gives a little and feels marshmallow - y soft on feet , and the look is feminine , not clunky . i ' ll be buying another pair this year - and my " old " ones are still in great shape . i just want to be sure i get them in case they ever stop making them ! 
very comfy . true to size . my best friend has a pair as well , and she ' s worn them all over for at least 5 years . 
i love the way these sandals feel , they also look nice , and i can walk for miles in them no problem - - the best thing since sliced bread , and they are all i wear all summer long - - only small problem is the dye rubs off a bit , and , so , i have black bottoms of feet all summer as well ! oh well , i guess we can never " have it all ! " . but i ' ll take the comfort , simplicity , and supportive arches over clean looking bottoms of feet any day ! they ' re still well worth it ! 
love these flip flops . i had the last pair over 10 years and loved them . only replaced them because i lost them when traveling cross country ! 
i love how they conform to your feet and are so comfortable . i remember they used to sell half sizes . i ' m normally a 6 . 5 and i couldn ' t find the size anywhere . the 6 fits but it ' s a bit small . 
these flip flop are perfect , and they last a long time , i love them . perfect for the beach but also for any time of the day , they look good in leggins , drenes , shorts , etc , etc 
these are really nice flip flops . they fit true to size . maybe not quite as comfortable as sanuk or cobian brands - but decent 
love these flip flops . they are very comfortable and fit great . the thong part doesn ' t bother my feet at all like some flip flops do . the trending is a nice pattern too . 
i always make sure i read reviews before i buy & i saw that some stated these run small . i wear a size 7 so i bought a size 9 & they still was to small so i will be returning them . they are very pretty i wish they had fit : ( 
these are amazingly comfortable . i wore them all day while shopping , right out of the box and no soreness or blisters anywhere . i felt like they were made specifically for my feet ! i would give these 5 stars but their sizing is off . however , because of all the great people who gave reviews warned about it and said to order a size larger than you wear and i did , they fit perfectly . i have high arches so it is extremely difficult to find any shoe that gives support , i can happily say these do . they are like walking on pillows . the material between the toes is soft there ' s no rubbing at all . the top of the straps are just to the bottom of your toes , which makes them look like they would be difficult to keep on . it ' s quite the opposite , i didn ' t have to tighten my toes , and walked just like i was wearing enclosed shoes . great for the calves . these are by far the best flip flops i have ever worn and the only ones i will buy in the future ! just remember if you buy , order one size up ( if you wear a half size then you will be okay by just going with the next nearest whole size , e . g . 8 1 / 2 would order a 9 ) . 
these slippers run a bit small , so order one size up from your usual . other than that , quite nice product . 
i just didn ' t like it at all . not comfortable and hurted my foot . very un happy with this product and it runs smaller that the original size . 
i think that these are fairly expensive for sandals . . plain old flip flops . . . but i needed some for a trip where i am going to be at the beach a lot and also walking in them a lot . . i decided to spend a bit more money and splurge on reefs i always envy on others . cons : - i think that they are a bit expensive and they are made a bit cheaper than they once were . its sad when companies cut costs or dont pay attention to how their products are being made when they have a reputation on the line . i can tell from previous years that the material is a bit cheaper . - they look less expensive as well . these dont have as much as the reef look seeing that they are so simple you cant see any branding on them . . . - reefs are rather narrow . they perfectly fit my feet , but i would never buy them for my sister without her trying them on first because they are a narrow fitting sandal . . . its easy for them to make your feet look wider and bigger because the straps are so skinny , so if you dont have more delicate feet you should consider trying them on before blindly ordering them online . pros : - there is no denying that these are comfortable . they are spongy and they have a slight arch support that is hard to find in regular cheap flip flops . - the simplicity of their design and the thin straps make them easy to wear with jeans , and if you are lazy like me with skirts and dresses . they are feminine enough . - they are fine getting wet ( which most sandals should be ) - you dont have to break them in . you ever buy sandals and the middle part between your toes gets sore and you have to break them in ? these are really soft and comfortable . . the moment that i put them on it was like i had them forever . . . nothing uncomfortable and the strap material is really soft and flexible . overall i am happy that i have a pair . i might do some more research and buy a different pair of reefs next year that are a tad more exciting , but for the purposes of a good everyday flip flop these are comfortable and attractivei wear a size 7 . 5 and i bought the size 8 which fit well . 
these flip flops are not the same as the reef ginger flip flops i bought a couple years ago and still use . there is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles . i ' m still going to wear them , but if you are buying these to replace an older pair . . . they are not the same . on the positive , they are true to size . i wear a size 8 and they fit . 
i ' ve been wearing reef flip flops for over 10 years and have always worn a women ' s size 9 . i recently ordered two pair of this flip flop in size 9 and they are too small . when compared to my old reefs , the new size 9 is about half an inch shorter . i had to send both pair back . will try again with a size 10 , but fear they will be too big . i ' m really disappointed that reef has changed their sizing . boo . 
i love these flip flops ! they always last me a couple years and the fit is perfect ! ! great flip flops ! 
i bought these sandals 3 years ago when i couldn ' t find my size in the thicker strap reef ' s in store . i wasn ' t thrilled until i got them on . they are wonderful ! i ' ve now had them 3 years and they still look / feel great . these are a fabulous purchase , so i ' m buying them again ! 
these are , by far , the most comfortable and cool flip - flops i ' ve owned . they last . they don ' t hurt . and they have a really cool look , too ! 
i ordered larger than normal . fit me the way i like , slightly big . i do not like my toes or heels to hang over , and they don ' t . one drawback . they did leave the bottoms of my heels black , and i think after being out in the hot sun with them , it left a light black trail on my carpet . . . . other than that , they are very comfortable , cloth straps , doesn ' t hurt my toes or top of my foot and do provide some support . haven ' t made up my mind yet if i would order again . 
super comfy , super cute and i just love them , i can wear them with everything lol i ' m so glad i got them ! ! m 
these are terrific flip flops . they have good arch support and the soles haven ' t squished down like other brands of flip flops i ' ve had . i ' ve been wearing them almost daily for months and they ' re practically like new . 
great fit , great color . love reef . never going back to ordinary flippies . i am sold on reef . can wear them for long periods and feet are good as new . lots of support and super cute . 
this is the second pair of these flip flops we ' ve purchased and they are as expected . our daughter loves them . 
i ' ve had these sandals before and then i lost them . so i bought another pair only to be disappointed that it comes smaller now . i usually wear an 8 , so naturally i bought an 8 . but when i tried it on , it was too small . i asked for the an exchange and amazon immediately sent out a bigger size for me . i can ' t wait to get them now ! 
reef is true to its brand . i love this narrow style . if i could buy in a different pair , color , style for my beach wardrobe i would ! ! 
i wear a size 10 , and these are the exact length of my foot , so there ' s not much room . this isn ' t necessarily a bad thing , but something to consider . personally , i think that these are slightly overpriced for what they are , but much like anything else , you ' re paying for the brand name rather than quality . i ' ve also noticed that the material is rubbing off on the bottom of my foot giving me black heels . overall , they ' re good flip flops that should last a long time . 
i got a pair of ginger reef sandals on a trip to california adventure once upon a time . i wasn ' t used to sandals but in no time i had broken them in and they were so cushy and comfortable , they conformed to my feet . i wore them just about every day and they lasted me literally about 4 years . they were still wearable when i finally retired them , but they wouldn ' t have lasted too much longer . these sandals are the most durable articles of footwear i ' ve ever owned , about 10 times over . they ' re great , though they do tend to get dirty over time . . . but they last . 
i got these in black and absolutely love them . they are comfortable , durable , and very classic looking . the cloth straps make them effortless to wear . there ' s nothing fancy about them . they ' re just very well made basic and classic flip flops . for me they ' re a must have item for summer . 
after 12 years ( ! ! ) of enjoying the comfort of my previous pair of brown reef flip flops it was time for another purchase . you really can ' t go wrong . they are plain brown and will go with anything , they offer so much comfort and won ' t bother your feet . . . ever , and they are durable . i put my other reefs through the ringer - - they ' ve been through a lot . i feel as though the quality of my new pair is just as great . yay . do it . buy a pair . you won ' t regret it . 
this is my fourth pair of these flip flops . my other pairs are still in great shape . i just saw that amazon was having a sale and couldn ' t resist . my new pair feels a bit stiff next to my favorite worn pairs but i ' m sure they will soften up . the amazing thing about reefs is the arch in the footbed . i wish reefs made shoes too ! and i love the thin straps . the black pairs look ' dressier ' with the thin straps . 
these are my favorite go to flip flop for summer came ontime and packed well would buy again and again 
i love my reef ' s . i usually wear a size 8 but order a size 9 in reef ' s because they are a little on the small side . this flip flops are very comfy and can be worn anywhere . washing them off isn ' t an issue and wearing them wet is fine . couldn ' t be happier with my purchase ! 
i love reefs so i was not hesitant to purchase these for my vacation in which i would be walking constantly long distances for over a week . they did not let me down ! so comfortable , lots of support , fits as expected , and a nice subtle life that makes these flops go with casual or something dressier . love ! will be ordering more 
very cushy flip flip . the straps are nice too . my feet blister very easily , but i walked long distance as soon as i got these with no problems . 
i have never had such a comfy pair of flip flops before . the string does not hurt at all and the flip flops are soft so they totally do not hurt my feet . i love them ! will probably get one more pair of them in another color in the future ! 
they came before what i was told . when i got them out of the box and tried them on the fit was great ! sometimes they are a sm 7 but these were right on ! 
these are on the small side . . . my foot just barely fits . i have been buying reef flip flops for years and usually start the season off with at least 3 new pair , but i ' m not going to count this as one that i will be wearing away from the house . though still very comfortable , they just look like i ' m wearing my daughter ' s shoes . 
ever since i lived in hawaii i have loved reef slippers , i buy them often but always look for sales 
this pair is my second from amazon and i love the style . the straps are more narrow as is the footbed so they are more like a sandal in appearance . love them . 
i have been wearing reef ' s since 2004 , specifically the ginger style . i ordered a new pair of black ones and they are too small . i don ' t know why reef changed the sizing , but i am unhappy . i have several ginger reef flip flops all in size 5 and they fit perfectly . . . i think a size 6 would be too big , so i am not risking ordering them online . 
i bought a pair of these from a beach shop about 3yrs ago and recently broke them playing soccer in them . i was so happy to find that they are around $ 5 - 10 cheaper ( including shipping and handling ) on amazon rather than reef . com ! 
these are the most comfortable flip flops and i love that my foot doesn ' t slide around in them if i just stepped out of the pool . they are awesome and i could live in them in the summer . 
love the brand and the prices was great i ordered three pair two for me 1 for my daughter and she loved them 
the straps on these are material and i ended up with a blister at the strap after wearing them twice . don ' t think the shoe is the problem though but there is a reason i usually do not wear flip flops . 
love these reefs ! one pair i had lasted literally ten years ( no exaggeration ! ) until they finally bit the dust a couple weeks ago . i was quick to order another pair and these are just as comfortable and well - made as my old pair - and i know they will conform even more to my feet over time . i bought a couple pairs of stacked wedge reef sandals , made from a more rubber - type material that is stiff and does not give , and was disappointed that they were not nearly as comfortable as these classic guys . reef , don ' t change a thing ! 
these are comfortable but the straps are anchored really far into the interior of the foot bed , making them seem excessively narrow . so when you step down on the shoe it kind of yanks the straps back . annoying design flaw so i think i will return . 
i have owned three pair of these exact reef ' s for many years now and love them . i usually wear a size 8 and purchased an 8 in these but the straps were too tight so i would recommend getting at least a half size or full size larger . 
even though i returned these flip flops because the sizes run small , i would definitely purchase them in the future . they are so comfortable . they feel like you ' re walking on air . 
i wear flip flops as much of the year as i can , and even when i can ' t wear them outside , i wear them in the house . i am very happy to have discovered reef sandals . they are the most comfortable sandals and a reasonable price . the ginger flip flop has a nice thick sole that provides some arch support and the top is a pretty design on cloth . for flip flops , these are stylish and comfortable and the size is true to my shoe size . ( if there is any question , go to the next higher size . ) my only concern is the part that goes over the foot . although it is very cute , the top is somewhat thinner than i am accustomed to so i am not sure that it will hold up as well as some of the others . however , because it is thin , it is very comfortable . 
this is m fourth pair of reefs and i love them . they are very comfortable and these colors are really pretty . i will be ordering more . would recommend . 
wow ! these flip flops are definitely the best i ' ve ever owned . i ' ve been suffering with plantar faciitis for a few months and was told by a friend that these give your feet really great support . well , she wasn ' t kidding ! my condition has improved dramatically because of the support that these flip flops give . i slip them on immediately upon rising in the morning and alternate between them and sneakers . i ' ve noticed a tremendous improvement and will definitely buy them in more colors . they are also very reasonably priced . 
flip - flop looks great , feels comfy ( just tried on , haven ' t wore for any length of time ) , but the color description on the pair i purchased was brown ( sole ) / white ( straps ) . . . the straps are actually an off - white , not white . . . not what i was expecting . 
i didn ' t realize how much support this simple sandal would provide to my feet but it was a godsend when i happened to take them with me ( brand new ) on a trip . too much walking caused my feet to swell out of my shoes so began using the sandals . i really needed the foot support for my aching feet . great price for a great fit and nice looking light weight sandal . 
i discovered reef ginger flip flops years ago , and will not buy any other flip flop since . the arch support in these plus fabric uppers , makes them comfortable for all day walking in summer , and no irritation between toes . they do squish over time and lose their support , but they usually last a full summer season for me . these are really the best ! 
these are cute , good for the hot weather . the only negative thing about them involves my own misperception : i got the impression from the picture that there was a little arch support - but these are regular flip - flops . 
ive always loved reef flops because of their simple aesthetic and classic look . goes with everything and have a thick sole so your feet will not hurt after a day of wear . a must have for summer beach bummers ! 
i used to buy cheaper flip flops . and while i still like them , some of them are like walking on cardboard . and if you pound pavement for any length of time , you feel it later ! ( especially if you are no longer 16 ! ) i didn ' t want to move all the way to " support " sandals or " hiking " ones . . . because they usually are just a little clunky for me . so , i went forteva mush . i loved them . but after a month or so , they were flattened out in places ( especially the heel . ) i don ' t like that . so i bought another pair . . . same thing . and while i loved the softness of those , i didn ' t want to spend every summer buying 2 - 3 pairs of the same things . and i found these . they look pretty much like the same shoe . . . but they are not . i liked that they both have a simple thin strap , which shows off more of your foot and doesn ' t leave big " tan lines " ! and they were soft . these are not as mushy as the teva mush , but firm - soft . like you are walking on a mattress ! ! ! another nice thing over the teva ones is that the surface is more solid / smooth . the teva ones are more spongey . . . so sand gets in those holes and is hard to get out . which changes the color slightly . and that shows on a black pair . but there is a little trade - off , if your feet and shoes get wet ( like at a waterpark or rain or something ) these can be a little more slippery . it does improve after you wear them a while . this is the third year in a row that i have bought these . the old ones aren ' t worn out ( like the flattened tevas ) , but the color fades slightly and they do get wear . i wear mine all the time . i even wear them in the house when i am standing a long time ! i do wear a half - size , and i chose a size up . i don ' t like it when people ' s heels are hanging out over the end of the flip flops , so i erred on the bigger size . and they are fine . i was thrilled that they also come in more colors . . . i bought three pairs actually ! the black ones on this page , metallic onesandsilver / gray / black ones . the metallic was for my daughter but she has wider feet than i do and she can ' t get the straps on comfortably . so , i guess they are mine . she can fit the same size teva mush , so she is getting those . even if i have to replace them when they get smushed . so if you have wider feet , and love the style you might want to compare these with those teva ones . . . amazon does have free returns on these , so that is nice . 
i love that these have arch support and they really last . i don ' t like that either my feet have grown or they ' re making them a bit smaller 
i ' m a 9 medium but these run small . i had to send them back . i ended up choosing a different reef flip flop called sea shore . i did go ahead and order it a size bigger than what i ware . seems reefs run small . 
the flip - flop is comfy , but they run very small , and are thinner than expected , so get one size larger than regular . 
great bright pink color . comfy and well - made flip flop as are all reefs . i need the ones with the & # 34 ; ribbon : between the toes so it doesn ' t hurt and reef never lets me down . 
these are perfect for everyday use . i wear flip flops 5 months out of the year and these are my favorite and affordable . 
these are the most comfortable flip flops ever and i ' ve work this design for 8 years now . love them : ) . they are my every day pair of flip flops . 
i ' ve had these over a year now and am just getting around to writing a review , but i have to say that i really love them . i usually don ' t expect flip flops to last long , but these have held up very well and have been comfortable since the moment i first got them . if these ever do wear out , i ' ll be buying them again immediately . 
i knew when i ordered these that they may not be & # 34 ; for me & # 34 ; , since my feet are wider . . . but i gave it a shot anyway . they were just too small and narrow . i could have ordered a size bigger to accomodate the width , but then i don ' t think they would fit as they should . i sent these back , but would still recommend to folks with thin / average feet . 
i ordered these a week before my husband and i went to antigua . soooooo comfortable . they wear really well , don ' t make your feet black ( from the bottom ) , and are easy to walk in . i liked them so much , i picked up another pair last minute at a local store . i would purchase these again . 
the only beef i have with these is that they were a little stiff when i first received them , but they are good now . 
i have been a fan of reefs for a long time , and i ' m so happy that they are on prime shipping now ! these sandals mold to your feet meaning that they will eventually fit you and really only you . they do get slippery if you try and wear them in the rain , but i love them . 
these flip flops are so cute ! ! ! i was hesitant about ordering a size - up , but the other reviewers were right . i am a size 5 . 5 and the six is a perfect fit . 
to start , i have to say that this is the first pair of reefs i ' ve ever owned . i ordered the right size , lucky for me , which ended up being the same as the size i wear for toms ( if that helps anyone else ) . i love the soles , which seem great for wearing on a boat , which i did , with no problems . the footbed is squishy and supportive at the same time . the only thing i do not like is the material of the strap . it started to rub my foot raw after about 2 hours . it ' s not seeming to get any better , either . i ' m used to my rainbows but i picked these because i had read that they were much lighter , weight - wise , and they are . but i am not in love with the sore on top of my foot . 
these are still one of my favorite flip flops . so comfortable and basic to go with anything and they have held up great through tons of the ' elements ' . 
tow hangs off side and width is very narrow . i have skinny feet and it barely fit under the strap . not comfortable the flip flip was very stiff 
great sandal ! very comfortable and holds up to miles of walking . molds to your feet , so after a few wears , they ' re perfect . 
when i first got these in the mail i thought they would not last a week ; they are very light . however , they ' ve been the most comfortable flip flops i ' ve ever had ! their lightness makes them easy to walk in , and they contour my feet very well . since i live in tucson i ' ve worn these almost every day for the past six months and they still look great . update : i ' ve had these a year now , still wearing them almost every day , and they are still going strong ! the treads have worn off the bottom so i no longer wear them when it ' s raining , but usually it ' s the straps that break on a flip flop . but the straps on these gems are still fully intact ( besides a bit of fuzz on the fabric ) ! 
finally - a flip flop with a bit of arch support ! my daughter simply cannot wear flat shoes , and these work for her ! 
had read about the orange monster on watch forums for months and finally had to have one . the links are a bear to remove due to their design ( double headed push pin ) . bezel moves freely but is just a tad too easy to move ( not that i use it for anything but it gets moved around by normal bumping in daily use ) . great lume , especially for a seiko . will have to agree with the majority of the horological community . . . this watch is a steal for what it offers ! will be pulling the trigger on a black monster and wish i had the cash to buy the limited edition blue currently on sale ! 
this is a solid dive watch by seiko , and is of high quality even compared to other watches by seiko in the same price range . the bracelet is very comfortable , no pressure points on the wrist , and sits well on the center of my wrist joint . it has a very bright illumination on the hour marks , the hands , and the dot at the top of the bezel . it ' s finished with a combination of polished and brushed accents . the bezel is raised around the edges higher than the glass so it ' s even more resistant to scratches . the bezel spins purposely and feel very sturdy , with soft clicks . power reserve is about 24 hours . to adjust the bracelet though , take it to a watch shop . the pins are held in by some kind of cap and if you ' re not familiar with it , you ' ll break it or your tool . 
i purchased this watch as a companion piece for the 1st . generation black monster that i ' ve owned and loved for years . i couldn ' t be happier , especially considering the inclusion of the metal bracelet ; do the arithmetic and subtract $ 60 from the total cost of the watch ( that ' s the upgrade price for an original equipment metal bracelet ) and you ' ll get an idea of how affordable it really is when purchased together ! hand wind and hacking features are absent from 1st . generation monsters . both are good to have , but i ' ve found them to be less than necessary for most daily applications . the accuracy of timekeeping ( which is , after all , the notion behind wearing a watch ) is on a par with automatics costing far more . you can ' t go wrong with this one unless you prefer a more subdued color for the dial . if that ' s the case , check out the lst . generation black monster - same fine quality . 
as men we don ' t get a lot of mainline fashion choices . i already own another seiko watch ( gift from my brother ) but the deal i got on this one was hard to pass up . particularily since i have a lot of affinity for orange ( one of my favorite colors , it is also the color of the branch i am in in the army ( signal ! ! ) ) and already have a fairly massive wrist ( i needed all of one link removed to make sure i got a solid fit ) . works great so far ( and probably for the rest of my life ) . gotta love the lack of winding . 
i ' m a regular collector of diving watches and this is one of my favorite ones . there is something about diving watches that is really attractive though it could be subconscious and because of the fact that you can get it wet and it would still work . this watch feels rock solid like it just came out from a huge chunk of metal . for such a quality feel , the price is super amazing . i would have to go for my submariner for a similar feel and on some days , i prefer the feel of this than of my submariner ! the luminated markers are the brightest i ever seen on any watch , diving or non - diving . clasp is super - awesome , better than the submariner . bracelet is not as nice looking but ok . the moveable bezel has the best click of any of the diving watches i own and this is the least expensive dive watch of all but unfortunately i paid a little too much . the only downside and may not be for you if you don ' t adjust your bands , but if you do , it ' s a chore . i spend hours trying to do this and was only successful after improvising as the linking system is very unusual . 
should have waited for the updated model . . . band fit without adjacent good thing seems the band is a pain to adj . 
in a growing collection of dress , casual , diving , smart and other watches , i ' ve found it hard to cycle to my next watch as usual . . . i ' ve worn this one since i received it . it looks great and imo is one of the best bang - for - buck watches you can get without stepping up to the next bracket in watch budgets . i also bought the black rubber strap band for it and prefer the look of it , but it ' s always good to have the metal bracelet in case you want to resell in the future . . . not that i would ! 
packaging : the watch was well and safely packaged and on a nice pillow . thebox is hard cardboard , high quality but not as premium as i ' ve seen . came with assorted printed material likethe manual and some coupons . no extras for people that like to get stickers etc . the watch itself waspristine , with protective adhesive plastic on it . look & feel : it ' s a lovely watch . nice bright orange dial , thick , gorgeousclicking bezel and the lume is as fantastic as the hype . the sweeping second hand is a nice touch . the dial isnot as big as you would think from the pictures but is a really decent size and very legible . has apremium look and feel to it . the watch is a fair weight on the hand which i like but others may not . i have wornheavier watches . it really is a classy watch and to my taste blends in just fine with most of my work attire . operation : setting the time is simple . i don ' t know if the watch is accurateto the second but it keeps good time near as i can tell . that being said , it is a kinetic watch ( winds upby motion ) and will stop if you put it down a long time . i have found that if you give it a long shake ( no needto be rough , just rotate it gently left to right ) , like just about a minute will suffice , it will survive aday without being worn on the wrist . setting the date is a bit tedious , you have to fiddle with it a bit butit does work . the screw down crown does go on tightly and while it is fairly easy to remove , even slightlygreasy hands won ' t do . adjustments : my wrists are medium , about 7 . 5 inches and the watch neededadjustment . removed two links . keep in mind when you remove the link pins , that each has a small collar . do notlose these . if you google around the net , there are instructions and they all advise that the collar iseasy to lose ( even by jewelers ) . i would advise using a watch link removal tool if you ' re doing ityourself . there are cheap ones around . i tried using a paperclip and it was difficult for my thick fingers . iwould avoid using a small screwdriver as it is likely to scratch if you ' re not careful . finale : the watch is excellent , beautiful and worth having . 
this is an awesome watch . great dive watch , great automatic watch ( winds from the movement of your wrist ) , great big watch . with a stainless steel bracelet or a rubber strap , this is water resistant to 200m , with strongly luminescent markings on an orange dial , and a unidirectional bezel . the orange was selected for visibility at depth , and the bezel that rotates in one direction is a hold over from the days before digital dive computers . the large dial also aids visibility . it uses an excellent and proven movement from seiko , the 7s26 , the basic movement of the seiko 5 series of watches . " 5 " for the five traits ; 1 . automatic , 2 . water resistant , 3 . shock resistant , 4 . date , 5 . day . for someone who wants an automatic without paying swiss prices ( or wants to avoid invicta and their issues ) , this is an excellent choice , as it would be for someone buying their first automatic watch . no kidding , this movement keeps time as well as the workhorse of swiss movements , the eta 2824 - 2 . this watch is a big watch . we ' re talking one serious hunk of steel . about 43mm diameter and 11mm thick , this is pretty darn big , and carved out of a block of steel , so heavy also . this might put some folks off , and some folks might go for it for compensations ' sake , but i like a watch like this for outdoors , working out , and other tasks that would put a lesser timepiece in mortal peril . i ' m sold , this thing rocks . e . m . van court 
. . models seiko ever made ! gets lots of attention and has fantastic lume , fit / finish . despite the title & # 34 ; orange monster & # 34 ; it is not that big . . . fits and looks good on my small wrist . ss metal band is a tank . . . very heavy and way over the top . i would suggest ordering it with the ss band and then getting some of the seiko oem rubber straps which make the watch look right and feel lighter ! accurate , solid super cult watch . 
i am a watch collector . it is better than some more expensive watches . it has a great look and feel . it is heavy but balances well on the arm . it is now one of my favorite watches . love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
very solid watch . easy to real dials , and the luminous hands are easy to see in the dark . this is a watch made for some fairly serious scuba diving . its nickname is the & # 34 ; orange monster . & # 34 ; a quality watch that should last a long time . shop around though . i doubt you ' ll find one for less than $ 185 , which is what i paid . well worth it , though . i strongly recommend , though , you also puchase a winder for it if you are not going to wear it every day . look for a sale on world of watches . they ' re normally $ 70 , but you can get them for half that if you ' re patient . i also recommend you get one with a metal band . it has a number of nitches on the clasp , so it ' s easy to fine - tune the fit on your wrist . 
finally got my orange monster ! outstanding seiko workmanship and quality ! i love this watch ! i wear it every third day to keep it wounded . 
the watch has a hard time keeping time as it seems that the hands stick . i can send it back but i decided to keep it and just deal with it . 
the orange monster is a true men ' s dive watch . it is attractive and has a decent size . the watch is bigger than thecitizen men ' s eco - drivepros : unidirectional bezel with luminous zero position on the bezel . the bezel markings are embedded not printed on - this watch is built to last ! the bezel has 120 indents so you can set the bezel to time your dive to the half minute . really bright luminous hands - including a luminous sweep second hand . orange dial for greater visibility underwater in poor light . day and date display at the 3 o ' clock position . day setting in english or spanish . weedkdays in black , sat in blue and sun in red , day in black ) . scratch - resistant hardlex crystal - curved to magnify the dial . even the day and date is visible underwater ! the bezel is higher than the hardlex crystal glass reducing the possibility of scratches . the large screw down crown is at the four o ' clock position . in this position , the crown never presses into my wrist when i move my hands upwards ) . the orange monster ' s large crown is much easier to manipulate than thecitizen men ' s eco - drive - also a great dive watch . this is an automatic movement watch - it never requires a battery . the watch winds itself with the natural motion of my wrist . now that ' s eco - friendly ! high quality seiko stainless steel band ' s fold over clasp with safety keeps this orange monster secure on your wrist . stainless steel band has an easy to use , fold - out diver ' s wetsuit extension . cons : automatic watches being mechanical are never as accurate as a quartz movement - they gain time when it ' s hot and run slow as it gets colder . when compared to other automatic winding watches , the orange monster is fairly accurate - approx ten seconds off per day . this works for me . however , if you need greater accuracy , then i recommend theseiko men ' s snda63 diver chronograph watchthe seiko orange monster is an attractive automatic dive watch at an affordable price - definitely 5 stars ! recommendation : if you wear your seiko orange monster dive watch every day , no problem . . . once on your wrist , it winds automatically . however , occasional users or watch collectors may wish to invest in a watch winder . i bought thediplomat burl wood watch windersince this model can be set to rotate both clockwise and anticlockwise automatically . check around for the best deal on this seiko orange monster dive watch ( skx781 ) - the price varies on amazonhope my review was helpful . . . jeffrey a . ( jeff ) 
i bought the watch from amazon direct and paid extra for overnight shipping . although the watch did not arrive overnight , i am quite pleased with the price , and quality of the watch . this is a must have timepiece for an seiko or dive watch collector , or someone who wants good quality heavyweight watch for less than $ 200 . 00 . i also bought the black monster at the same time , and that is equally as nice . i have purchased from amazon a few times and the experience has been good , i will continue to use amazon unless something goes amiss . my only issue is the amount of processing time until shipment happens . and i don ' t mind paying for overnight if i want something the next day , but i want it to arrive the next day . that ' s it . 
. . . . it isn ' t the most accurate . don ' t get me wrong , i absolutely love this watch , it is my favourite in my collectionit ' s built like a tank and after one year of workday wear isn ' t showing any wearor scratches at all . put this watch on your right wrist and another watch on yourleft , and you will feel the weight of it alright . if i only had one watch , this would be the one , but i get bored and need variety inmy life so i have 9 and rotate them all . my most accurate is a cheap casio digital . i haven ' t got a watch winder so when i ' m not using the orange monster during the day , i wear it to bed at night and in the morning when i shower and shave and then useanother watch . this way it gets a wind up . i recommend this watch if you are looking for one that can take a beating , and like meyou do physical work and are always knocking your watch around . i ' ve broken quite a fewin my lifetime . if you don ' t like a heavy lump on your wrist that builds up your muscles , thatglows in the dark like a coven of fireflies , that causes grown manly men to sigh in envy andin the wearing of it makes you feel like you mean business , then don ' t even consider thiswatch , it ' s not for you , i was hesitant before buying this watch , thinking it was too garish and bulky , but it grows onyou to the point where you never want to take it off , and indeed i have worn it for weeks onend . it ' s an ' orange monster ' ! 
great watch . mine has taken a bit of a beating and is still working great . i am a dishwasher amongst other things and it has held up well . maybe not the best looking piece , but really nice for fast food service industry id say . ive since upgraded to a squale 20 atmos . 
seiko ' s skx781 " orange monster " is achieving cult status among automatic sports watch collectors and avid scuba divers . along with a similar style in black , model skx 779 ( black monster ) and the 300 lucky owners who collected a limited edition " yellow monster " some years ago - seiko has produced a classic sports watch for the ages . even those who collect automatic sports watches or chronographs that cost into 4 figures view this watch as a must have for their collections ( along with the invicta pro series dive watches ) . like my commuter car toyota rav4 - a " beater " for everyday travel to the office - a " beater " watch with style , elegance , color and practicality for $ 200 or less is a rare find . this is a watch that makes a clear statement on your wrist ! as an avid scuba diver - a water resistant watch to 660 feet is almost a standard when looking for dive watch purchase features . when the stainless steel band has a triple lock , a deployment clasp for wetsuit , softly rounded comfortable links coupled to a massive free uni - directioinal rotating bezel - most of us take notice . combined with a " flamethrower " glow in the dark dial - beautiful orange face and overall massive sculpted stainless steel case - you have a winner . the wow factor on this time piece is way up there . this watch is not seiko of america standard stockage - but must be dealer ordered from seiko japan or gray market wholesaled from japan or singapore dealers . it is also made for the china and far east market from a seiko factory in singapore . both japanese and singapore factories turn out highest quality timepieces . amazon ' s vendor sponsor - where i bought my watch - charges a fair price and has provided excellent service ( sent me the japanese factory made model ) . the day , date feature ( " complication " ) is clearly readable without the " rolex " type magnifier bubble ( aka " cyclops " ) . the 42mm stainless steel case ( 43mm with crown ) , uni - directional bezel can be joined either with a stainless steel bracelet or a rubber strap . the bracelet is a 70 . 00 + separate order item - while the seiko rubber strap is only a $ 25 - 30 saving when choosing your order . make no mistake - this is an imposing timepiece . many prefer the black ( monster ) version as the orange dial is an aquired taste for some of us . internally - the 7s26 automatic movement is the one found in all styles of the under $ 300 seiko diver watch model range . while not seiko ' s premier automatic watch movement - it is a tried and true lifetime ( with proper service ) movement . it has a smaller than average weighted rotor - can be immediately charged with just a few brisk shakes before mounting on your wrist - and can be put on all watch winders to keep it fully charged and ready to wear . this movement - to save money in manufacturing - cannot be manually wound . day date must be adjusted on all months not 31 days long . use of plastic day / date internal rotors are self lubricating and will stand a lifetime of wear . any criticism of the watch can be found in this area - the mechanism taking up to 3 hours to change the day / date at midnight . possible downside of this watch : 1 . not a quartz - but a spring wound auto - wind . 2 . thick and heavy - not suitable to all folks who like a thin , light watch . tough to fit under a shirt cuff - unless you ' re a pirate . 3 . not seiko ' s most precise auto - wind movement . still - a tried and true reliable performer - but not a chronograph time keeper . 4 . crystal " hardlex " watch face not as scratch resistant as sapphire watch face from dive watch competitors ( such as invicta ) . 5 . can ' t manually wind movement ( as in invicta 8926 series ) . available from amazon vendors ( where i purchased mine ) or other us dealers - prices vary $ 40 or more . gray market from hong kong or singapore may save you up to $ 80 from authorized us dealers - but may present the owner with warranty and service acceptance problems from authorized seiko repair facilities here in the states should something go wrong .

you gotta give it to the japanese . they put four cylinders in a mid - size car and the car has muscle , good looks , and refinement . this orange monster has muscle , good looks , and is one of the most accurate watches i ' ve ever owned ! it ticks ( sweeps ) right along with my timex easy reader ( which is the most accurate watch i own ) . one can feel the quality in the build of this watch . it is a brick . i own watches up and down the bunny trail , from solar atomic to watch snob automatics . the bracelet is very comfortable ( better than most ) . the power reserve is better than any automatic in my collection . please do not set the day / date between 9pm - 4am . i did that and it caused the watch to stop running after 30 min . consistently . however , i rotated the time forward for a 24hr cycle . whatever , had the hands hung up went away . it has been running like a top since , two years now . this watch behaves like it has a battery inside . amazing . 
finally , i received my " orange monster " . it ' s a beauty . i couldn ' t wait to put it on , so i adjusted the bracelet ( this is tricky because ' s a new design ) . what a bracelet , extension and all . only the bracelet is worth $ 200 ! and there i was going to the dark room . the luminous on this watch is something else , surpassing my expectations . i believe seiko uses " lumibrite " on this watch , which is a newly luminous paint developed by seiko harmless to humans that absorbs the energy of sunlight or artificial light in a short time and stores it to emit a light in the dark . by the way , seiko manufactures all its components . the dials says diver ' s 200m and the caseback , scuba diver ' s . this watch means business eventhough i don ' t plan on going snorkeling in a while . this is a 42mm ( 46 . 5mm including the crown ) in diameter , 12mm in thickness , and 160g hefty watch . my seiko " knight " and " superior " weight 170g each , the " land shark " 185g , and the " samurai " 190g . so you know . the engine on the orange monster is the reliable , 21 jewel , 21600 vibes / h 7s26 workhorse : consistent , precise , quiet , and durable . after 24 hrs . the time is withing 1 sec . usually seiko ' s 7s26 needs settleting . i paid $ 195 from watch pavilion and it came with a nice non seiko box , and no papers . i guess this watch is not for sale from authorized distributors in the usa . anyways , watch pavilion gives you a 30 day money back guarantee , and you know seiko gives you 1 - year worldwide + 2 - years in usa . an instruction booklet , and a watch tool ( to safely remove the links ) was included . summary : for the price of a brand new rolex submariner date ( $ 4 , 400 ) , i could buy 22 + seiko diver ' s , watches that can last a life time . 
i like the watch . the orange face is distinctive and provides excellent contrast above and below the water . the day and date are large enough to read without being intrusive . the glow markers are quite visible at night for nearly one hour . when i can get the watch to run continuously ( more on that later ) , it is very accurate - - to within 3 - 4 seconds per 24 - hour period . the band is comfortable and secure , but easy to release with side buttons . yes the watch is waterproof - - i swim with it often and have taken it to 30m diving with no issues . the case diameter is just right for me - - not too big , not too small . however , the watch is very thick and very heavy - - by far the heaviest watch i ' ve ever owned . the machining and finishing on the bezel and case is very good for the price . the bezel has nice , subtle clicks when it is rotated , though on my watch i cannot precisely align the " zero " dot on the bezel with the exact 12 o ' clock line - - the bezel locks just slightly left of center . also the triangular greenish glow mark at 12 o ' clock was affixed slightly off - angle , so the center line in the top glow triangle does not line up with the 12 o ' clock black line on the face . poor qc on a $ 200 . 00 watch . the main issue i have with the watch is keeping it running . even if i wear the watch for 24 hours straight , it is a " crap shoot " if it makes it through the night without stopping . i have taken to consciously shaking the watch 3 - 4 times a day for a minute or so , and shaking it before i go to bed . i have to make this extra effort many times a day to get the watch to run without stopping . i did send it back to seiko on warranty . they said the watch was operating " to spec " and my only option was to replace the full mechanism on my nickel . the stated cost was $ 149 for mechanism replacement . however , the seiko service center said they would not guarantee the new mechanism to run all day and night if worn constantly . additionally they told me that , if the mechanism was replaced , seiko would no longer warranty the watch against water intrusion . so , i kept the watch " as is " . i still enjoy wearing it , but it is annoying to have to take it off many times a day and shake it to keep it running . after this experience i will not buy another seiko automatic watch . ymmv . other people , hopefully , have a better experience . i do note that i typically sleep very soundly with very little movement for 7 straight hours , which could make my experience different than others . 
very good looking and quite massive watch in my opinion . not for those who do not like heavy watches . accuracy so far has been in the + 15 seconds per day range . i believe that this is good performance for a mechanical watch but it does not come close to matching what a good quartz watch can do as i have two seiko quartz watches that are holding to less than 1 second per month error . at the price with the two straps and pin removing tools i consider it to be a excellent buy . 
there are a lot of reviews of this watch on amazon . the positive ones reflect my experience so far . ( about one month ) keep in mind that this watch is heavy and thick . this gives it a high center of gravity . it moves around on your wrist . ( it might be good for hitting a villain in the nose , however . ) the 7s26 movement cannot be hand wound as with many other automatic watches . this means unless you wear it every day , you will have to reset the time , day , date each time you wear it . the movement does have a good reputation for durability . it has mixed reviews for accuracy , but my life is imprecise anyway . i ' ll update this review in about 12 months . 
usually these run fast , sometimes very fast , but mine is great . it will lose about 5 - 10 seconds during the day & gain about 5 - 10 seconds at night . so . . . i ' m always within 5 - 7 seconds at any given time . not the norm for a seiko . 
after much looking i chose to buy this watch over a similar luminox watch as i wasn ' t sure i wanted a black watch . i like a few things so far , but i ' m far from sold on the others . i have the indonesian assembled version . first the price . 200 dollars seems pretty good . appearance : the watch appears to fit well ( after adjustment ) , and looks good . however i ' m not happy that the winding mechanism appears to be a different steel finish than the rest of the watch . i hope that ' s not due to inferior metal . lumbrite : not fully tested , but dissapointing so far . i have not worn this in direct sun for long periods , but maybe that ' s required to get any kind of good consistent long period of display in dark conditions . i ' m going on a week long dive boat trip in may and i willget a better idea there . accuracy : so far i ' m not impressed . i lose about two minutes every 5 days . maybe that is good , but i was hoping for betterafter reading reviews of losing only " 10 seconds a day . " for the record , my white monster runs fast so i guess i should have expected some dissapointment ? band , not sure it ' s the same high quality as my white monster ( also assembled in indonesia ) . it already came apart once but that may be due to the jewler ' s apprentice making a mistake . it fell off my arm a week after he removed to links . to be sure , i went back when the owner was present and he checked it outand fixed it . no problems since then . would i buy this again at this price ? not sure at this point . i ' m already considerfing the luminox seal watch . i will report back after diving with this for a week . * * * * * * added comments 17 feb . and now it has stopped working . time to find out how easy the warranty process is . i am bummed , i deliberated over this for months . 3 march comment : so after my wife traded emails with e stock watch for a week ( they were responsive but it took some back and forth ) we finally are sending the watch back for repair ( when it stops snowing ) . i tried winding it to make sure that the automatic movement good / kaput ! . nothing works . i ' m ok with them looking at it and fixing it ( afterall that ' s what their warranty coverage indicates they will do ) . but i would like to point out that you pay shipping each way for this " service " . will update when i get it back and adjust the rating appropriately . almost worth considering taking it somewhere else , but then i worry about experience in repair . * * * * * * * * * * * * 30 march update ~ sent the watch to alex at e watch stock and got it back in 4 work days . i am still not real pleased i had to pay shipping , but it appears to be fixed , and it has kept digital quality time for two weeks . i keep checking it with my atomic clock and cell phone and its spot on accurate . not sure what they did but very happy with the very quick repair . i think you can trust e watch stock . 
for my first automatic watch , this is one beautiful watch . it ' s actually not too big , i expected it to be bigger . it fits very comfortably on the wrist , and you don ' t really feel the weight , probably because the link is well designed . resizing the band isn ' t trivial , the band uses some kind of clasp pins , which you need to be careful when pushing out . i pushed them out with a medium sized sewing needle . the orange monster is truly a gorgeous watch ! 
the perfect watch ? maybe . but only if you want / need a dive watch , traditional design without bizarre gimmicks , world - class construction , stainless steel band , both day and date display , automatic winding , freedom from batteries , a bezel that rises slightly above the tough crystal to make it harder to scratch it against objects , cool sweeping second hand , incredible glow - in - the - dark readability , legendary seiko accuracy and reliability , very affordable price , very cheerful orange color - - i could go on and on . and someday i will . when i have enough time . actually , it ' s a lot easier to name the few things that could possibly be improved . if i can think of any . yep . yepper . yepperino . oh yeah : the crystal isn ' t sapphire . then again , everyone says that sapphire doesn ' t scratch : it shatters . so let ' s skip that one . and i guess mechanical watches can get magnetized and run fast , so you have to watch ( no pun intended ) out for that . and we ' re done here . 
it is a very decent dive watch . while not in the same league movement wise with my longines and omega watches , it is a superb for the money watch , with limitations ( non hacking ) , but i truly enjoy it , i have the black monster and the orange monster , and they are reliable and very sturdy and precise , but not as a chronometer watch would be . all mechanical watches get magnetized over time ( a few years ) , and they run fast . invest in a demagnetizer and learn to use it or take it to a watch repair shop periodically . 
i ordered at 4 : 45pm pst and they were able to ship that day and i received it 2 days afterwards . i ' ve purchased before on amazon , but this is the quickest i ' ve seen . thanks a lot . 
good product clear views . they are perfect for driving . i sue them all them time rain or shine . you could see clearly 
complete waste of money . the frame is not shiny & the glasses are not really blue & it dosn ' t help in the sun . it ' s more like cheap plastic safety glasses that it wear at work 
i have a very small framed face , so these did not fit me as well as i was hoping they would . however , i did give them to my brother , and they fit him very well . they look nice and keep the glare away . 
i have had two pairs of these and for the price , i love them . i find them to be very comfortable , good field of vision and polarization is helpful . i ' m hard on sunglasses so paying a lot of money for polarized glasses doesn ' t make sense for me . do they scratch easy , yeah , but for the price , i can buy four pairs of these , have a new pair every three months and still be money ahead compared to buying one of the & # 34 ; high end & # 34 ; name brands . 
i thought these were blue lenses but they are like a rainbow color , not just traditional blue lenses . i kept them and they will work fine , but not what i expected . 
this product is good because it is comfortable and beautiful ! i love it very much and it can protect me from uv : ) 
i have worn these for years and never get tired of the shoe style . i only wish the sole would last longer before coming apart . but , it is probably how much walking i do at work . overall , i would recommend this shoe to anyone wanting a basic , easy , comfortable shoe type sneaker . 
i had to give these away because they were so narrow they wouldn ' t fit my feet comfortably ( and my feet are pretty darn narrow ) . oh well ! 
keds fit weird & usually run very small . i wear a 9 . 5m or sometimes wide . ordered these in a 10 wide . they were huge , yet the same size in the leather is tight . go figure . 
these are a basic slip - on sneaker . i bought them because they ' re washable . i will only air dry to avoid yellowing of the canvas around the rubber sole . 
i have worn keds slip - ons like this for years and never had this problem before . i don ' t know the technical names , but the height between the insole and the upper is so short i can ' t even get my foot in the thing ! if you look at the picture where the " tongue " part is raised , this pair is flat . i even tried putting powder in the shoe to force slip it on and i can ' t get my foot in at all . very disappointed and i feel like this may be a " second " or " irregular " , not an actual keds for retail , which would explain the lower cost as well . very disappointed . 
these fit me perfectly , just as they always have . i was hesitant because of all the negative reviews but i had no problem with these shoes and would purchase again . 
shoes are not like other keds i ' ve worn in the past . they have little support , are flimsy , and look cheap . 
feds are my most popular type of shoe ! amazon carries just the right brand and size for me . 
well it fit right . i have narrow , tiny feet ( size 5 ) and these fit me pretty good . i dont like chunky looking shoes as im short ( 5 ft ) and they make me look extra short . nice slim shoes make my legs look longer and leaner and these do the job . yes , the sole is a lil stiff but they are great nonetheless . i love them and have been wearing them quite a bit ! the navy color is pretty sweet too . i wear them with shorts , jeans or even skater dresses or skirts ! anything really ! 
i have worn these shoes for years . they are made well , last for years and washable . . . which i love . always comfortable , and the price is great ! 
i liked the look of these shoes but they were too small . i considered a larger size but i could tell that the width would be too narrow . these would be terrible if you had bunyons . do not buy if you have a wide foot . 
keds products are reliable and affordable , unfortunately for me , i have swollen feet 90 % of the time . the & # 34 ; tongue & # 34 ; part of this particular shoe was too tight , i could not even get my foot in , so i think for the size , the wide is narrower than other shoe brands . the rating i gave is completely my fault . i rarely can find shoes with the kind of top of the foot coverage that i can fit into . i may have to try a slip on variety with less over the toe coverage , but keds is a great show brand . 
i love these shoes , they are comfortable and look nice . they are a nice change from always wearing flip flops . . . only problem is they get dirty easy . . . . so you have to be careful where you wear them . . . . . 
these are great . they fit perfect and look very nice . they are great for everyday wear or boating and even hiking . 
my friend is 99 and mostly blind . she loved these shoes . they slip on easily and fit just right . a super buy . 
i needed some simple shoes for walking my dog and climbing the steps at work . i didn ' t want to have to tie them and i didn ' t care if they were fancy , so i went with these . i ' m mostly happy with them . they are easy to get on and off without using my hands . they ' re a little snug but i do think they fit true to size ( and i was getting them to replace some shoes that were a size too big , so i may just be having to make an adjustment ) . they seem well made and are generally comfortable to walk in . the only thing i don ' t care for is that the right shoe gave me a big blister on the back of my ankle ; it has since rubbed pretty raw and i have to keep a bandaid on it . i ' m not taking off too much from my rating for that because i have had this problem with other new shoes , as well . just be forewarned that if you ' re not used to wearing keds or other shoes that are approximately this height , there may be a breaking - in period . 
this is an excellent summer or fall canvas slip on and is wide enough for a wider foot . . . . . good color too 
viet vets recognize the patch . . . . fun to wear at the monthly poker game . the hat is well constructed , sturdy and priced right . 
i ' m not a big hat wearer so it has to be something special for me to wear it . the army death spade is a classic and the quality of the hat seems the same as the mil - spec caps of my army days . besides wearing it drives the lib ' s nuts . 
9884 olive drab low profile death spade baseball cap fits great looks awesome ! glad i found this cap , recommend for all 
received in good condition and comfortable wearing it at the back its has adjustable strap & # 34 ; not the button type & # 34 ; if you know what i mean . . . thanks seller from singapore 
the cap nice and thick , fits my head real good . i like the adjustable buckle on the back . i will buy another if this one every wears out . 
i would not recommend this shoe , i purchased jambu dune sandals in size 9 and they fit very comfortably . i purchased these in size 9 . 5 medium because i had previously tried jambu shoes in a 9 and they were too small . at a 9 . 5 these shoes are too big in the heel and stubbing me in the toe . jambu sizing is so inconsistent that i really can not recommend buying their shoes online . you need to try them on in a shoe store . in addition , the lower portion of these shoes scuff very , very easily . i am talking about the plastic and leather lower part . for a week i only wore these shoes in my own home in order to brake them in . i have worn them outside only twice . in those two times outside the gold painted trim line around the plastic heel has begun to scuff off and there are all kinds of scuff marks on the plastic heel itself . for less than a week ' s worth a wear on regular sidewalks and inside a house , this is unacceptable . 
they are smaller than 7 . 5 . i have two pairs of these shoes , bought quite sometime , and they are very comfortable and fit perfectly . but the leather of these j - 41 women ' s kyoto are stiff and hurts very much . 
i have several jambu women ' s shoes . i love each one . they are stylish and comfortable . the price is reasonable for the quality . these are no exception , style , comfort and great color at a manageable price . 
great looking shoes , super comfortable , great quality , oh did i say super comfy ? . i will definitely purchase jambu shoes again . 
picture posted is of a lace up oxford , this is a mary jane pump . the shoe is true to size , wide in the toe area with plenty of wiggle room , good arch support , cushiony interior . it ' s also good looking , goes with skirts pants and jeans . note it is not leather , had i known earlier i wouldn ' t have ordered it since i only wear leather to allow the shoe to conform to my feet . in this case due to all the positives i ' m keeping it . 
i ' m loving this watch . it ' s just as shown in the picture . i ' m 54 years old and wanted a watch that would make easier for me to see the time even without my glasses on . this is the one . the anti - reflective coating on the mineral crystal really works , the black dial combined with the white hands and time markers allow you to see the time precisely . i ' m used to wear my watch at all times , when i ' m at the gym , when i ' m swiming , etc . and it ' s of utermost importance the watch is 100 % waterproof . the 330ft waterproof feature is just perfect for me . few women ' s watches have that feature . it ' s not a mid size watch though it ' s rather small : 6mm thick , 2 . 4 diameter total , and 1 . 9mm diameter , just the black dial alone . not having to replace batteries of course is a plus , also because once the watch has been opened for battery replacement , the waterproof feature in most watches i ' ve had goes away . . . great price , wonderful timepiece ! update july 12 , 2008 : i ' ve had this watch on my wrist long enough now . just wanted you all to know it works as great as the day i got it . precise time display , no leakage ( i swim with it ) . just perfect ! ! ! 
i purchased this eco drive due to my other failing . it really is a timeless piece , i love that the dial is black really dressy as well as a casual look its a keeper ! ! ! 
i ordered it as a gift to my friend , and she likes it . the outlook is pretty good , and time is accurate . 
i have so many watches that become dust collectors once they need a battery replacement . i won ' t have that problem with the eco - drive watch . i keep it on my kitchen windowsill to charge . i was able to take out a few links on the band easily for a perfect fit on my wrist . the numbers are very hard to discern in a dark room even when fully charged , however , it does emit a nice glow . i haven ' t had any skin sensitivities like i usually do with cheap watches . 
i received my watch within a few days of ordering and haven ' t taken it off since . time is accurate and the band is very comfortable . it looks great with any wardrobe , leisure or dressy . 
i love this watch . it ' s beautiful and it is very comfortable to wear . i ' m hard on watches but this one has been indestructible . 
this is a very classy , gorgeous watch . i adjusted the band on my own , and that ' s all i needed to do before wearing it . to get the watch started , i just placed the watch under a mini lamp . i get a lot of compliments on the watch . it ' s not too big and not too small . just right . it ' s a beauty ! plus , i know the battery will never die because i always wear it in sunlight . best watch ever made and owned ! 
i love this watch . small and pretty and practical . i don ' t need battery for this . it is such a good deal 
i ' ve been wearing this classic watch daily for about 1 / 2 year & it keeps very accurate time , the eco - drive technology works well without any problems so far , i just place it on my dresser table face up when i ' m home to recharge it with whatever light it gets ( artificial light or indirect natural light ) . but about once a month , i will super charge it by placing it on a windowsill to get some direct sunlight for an hour or few . but i will have to agree with some reviewers who mentioned that the watch crystal & band scratches quite easily , so far there ' s several small scratches on my watch ' s crystal & many scratches on the band but the watch still looks good . i love that i don ' t have to change batteries especially since my previous watches always lose its water resistance after the battery is changed once or twice . 
the watch is cute , but i bought it because the hands were supposed to be visible in the dark . maybe it ' s my eyes , but the face was to small for the hands to show up . 
i could not have made my wife happier with any other present than this watch that is constantly set at the correct time , is beautiful to look at and should never need the maintenance of replacing a battery . every quartz or battery operated watch , that she has ever owned , has always let her down at one time or another because of battery failure . then always comes the question as to where to take the watch to the change of battery , which can be a costly affair . again , this is a solar operated watch - - no battery ! but there is nothing that would lead you to believe it was anything but a feminine watch for a woman to wear for any occasion . sms 
after a string of expensive watches that formed water droplets on the inside of the crystal if i rinsed my hands , i was very happy to find a watch that offers good water protection , and is dressy enough to look nice with anything short of a cocktail dress . i could not be more happy with this purchase . 
i & # 8217 ; ve had this watch a couple years and it & # 8217 ; s still working great . it does need recharging every 6 months . all this means is that you need to place the watch in bright sunlight or artificial light for 24 - 48 hours to recharge the solar batteries . i & # 8217 ; ve gotten rid of all my other battery driven watches , saving money and hassle in the long run . 
this is really a beautiful watch . it doesn ' t look like a piece of jewelry , it looks like a nice watch . i like that . it was a bit tricky figuring out the proper way to set the day and i am a bit nervous for the month change because i ' ll have to break out the instructions . i think that the numerals and the hands glow in the dark , that was a nice surprise . 
got it as a anniversary gift and he loved it ! runs a bit small , but if you have a smaller wrist its great . fares well as a workout watch . 
i had quality control issues on my last citizen . thought maybe it was a fluke and gave them another try . this one looks great for casual attire , but the crown has already stopped threading back into place . not worth the effort to try and repair . i ' m done with citizen . 
i purchased this watch about a month ago . i am very pleased with the purchase and have only two things to comment on . the strap length , it is a bit short and i would say i have average size wrists for a 6 ' 0 " guy . that being said i buckle it into the 2nd hole from the end . i would prefer it to be 1 maybe 2 more inside but then you would have that overhang so i have learned to appreciate it . the strap color . in the picture it appears to be a tan tinted olive drab when in fact it is a very full green olive drab . i like it better but yeah it looks a bit different than it does in the picture . all and all it is a quality watch and i am extremely happy with my purchase . i would definetly recommend this watch . 
i purchased this for my dad a good 1 - 2 years ago . he wears it all the time now . it ' s proven very durable for him which is a plus . he ' s a man that cares abut function over fashion . the strap is comfortable for him and the batteries never run out . 
i haven ' t worn a watch in my adult life . bought this , love the look of it , and it ' s holding up really well ; has one scraped on the metal part from where i banged it hard against something , but yeah , fits well , works perfectly , never needs to be charged or batteries replaced , and looks really good . would definitely recommend to friends , and do ! 
looks good and replaces my old seiko watch for this purpose . definitely some uses for the chronograph while camping and better than pulling out the smart phone while you ' re dirty and roughing it ! 
i ' ve had this watch for over 2 years and i am very pleased with it . the dial is easy to read , the hands glow in the dark for a good while and it keeps great time . 
as a watch lover , i ' ve had this watch several years now and have enjoyed it . it ' s been long enough that i ' m certain i would have needed new batteries , but with the eco - drive solar system it ' s going fine with never a concern . i ' m able to put in a drawer for weeks at a time and when i get it out , it ' s still working fine . i leave it out in the light on a dresser every once in a while to assure it has a nice charge . this is a working watch for me , one i know wear when i know i might be doing things that could scratch one of my dress watches . i like the clean face on this watch . i generally dislike watches that have big rings around the crystal as it makes the watch unnecessarily large . of course if they have a purpose it can be acceptable . the clean font , the clean face , the small trim make this a very nice clean watch . the chronograph adds to that tasteful look by adding a bit of detail that i enjoy . the watch is accurate and i only change the time when it ' s the end of a month with less than 31 days and i have to fix the date of the month feature , thus it requires me to reset the time as i turn forward a day or two . i ' ve flown , swam , dived and used this watch in may varied environments and it has worked well in all of them . i ' m rough on watches and while my crystal is now scratched up , it isn ' t broken . to keep my scratching to a minimum i prefer watches with a flat crystal ( like this has ) , instead of the kind that pop up out of the face . i still manage to scratch it but i wear it working on engines and doing my chores and consider this a working watch so that ' s just the price i pay . dressy and more expensive watches get removed for those chores ! this is a great watch , with nice features for a really reasonable price . one negative for this watch is that the band is a bit small . not that my wrists are super big but i have to wear this band on the last catch . if it were any smaller i wouldn ' t be able to wear it out of the box . this seems unusual , almost like it ' s a ladies watch band ? the watch band is very solid and secure . there are metal eyelets around the clasp holes and it ' s really lasted well for me , i just wish it were a bit longer ; - ) 4 stars , it ' s a great watch , so wonderful to ever have to worry about batteries . but not 5 because the watch band needs to be a bit longer . 
i normally wear a seamaster , but wanted a cheaper watch to wear when traveling , being outdoors , etc . i find i wear it much more often than that and it has earned a place in my rotation . it ' s simple , accurate , sharp looking , and the small band doesn ' t create a problem since i have normal sized arms . i suppose those that can ' t fit can easily swap out the band , but i like the canvas / metal eyelet styling of it . 
large face , large numbers , looks great , feels great but the strap is a total joke . your wrist would have to be the size of a garden hose to actually work ! ! how could such a large watch have such a small strap . i was on the last hole of the strap and the remainder of the strap wasn ' t long enough to pass through the strap loop , so it just stood out . plus it was so tight it impeded the blood flow to my hand . in less than a minute i had the strap off and replaced it with an extra black rubber dive watch strap i had . now it fits and looks great too . 3 / 3 / 08 i over reacted to the strap and need to give more information about the watch ! i am totally pleased with the watch itself which is what people are really buying . two things you should know : 1 . the chronograph is only capable of timing 59 minutes / 59 seconds unlike a casio g - shock that can give elapsed time to 24 hours . 2 . the owners manual states that the silver oxide battery that stores power from the solar cell collector will have to be eventually replaced . when the description says you will never need a battery , they mean a conventional watch battery ! yes , its a geat watch with easy to read full face simplicity . but be warned that if your wrist is even " average size " plan on replacing the strap . 
i received this today and i am impressed with the almost everything about this watch . it is very classic in its style and easy to read except the date that is a little small for me . the band is comfortable and just the right size for my average size wrist . i you have a large wrist you will likely find the band short . the band is surprisingly stiff and is not simply a canvas band , it is more substantial . the operation of the chronograph is very straightforward and the date has a quick set function . one interesting feature is there is a 24 hour time indicator in the upper right ( 2 o ' clock position ) . the watch feels solid and neither too light or too heavy . i enjoy watches and have collected a number over the past 25 years but think this could be my everyday watch for a while . 
great watch , great price . . . cheesy band ( and it was too small ) . replaced it and i am fully satisfied . 
i just got this watch today and really like it . fairly light weight compared to my pro diver ( which is a nice change ) . i wanted a watch similiar to obama ' s but did not want to spend over $ 300 for the one he rec ' d as a gift from the secret service . this is almost as nice plus it is an eco drive . the chronograph dials are hard to read , esp the minutes but thats ok . the strap is just ok . i have smaller wrists so size was not a problem . can not give it 5 stars due to the strap and hard to read sub dials ( date hard to read too ) but these are minor issues . also the glow in the dark luminecense is not very good . lasts less than an hour . i put a black leather band on this and it dresses up the watch . the dial is not a deep solid black but more of a very very dark gray / greenish color but looks black for the most part . overall a solid 4 star rating . 
this is a great watch for the price , allowing that you won ' t be replacing batteries . it keeps very accurate time - i ' ve had mine 3 week now and i ' m not sure its more that a second off . the band is short like everyone says . i have a 7 1 / 2 & # 34 ; wrist & wear it closed at the 3rd hole . it is not uncomfortable - but i bought a black leather with red pipe stitching anyway . the watch looks so much better to me . a good deal all around 
always been a citizen eco - drive fan . have several watches from them and have never failed . this is perfect for the summer on my bike with easy read and constant charge . 
this is a great looking watch , the only problem was the size of the watch band , but i expected that , i have large wrists . i ordered a long leather watch band from a different web site . amazon has the watch band width shown incorrectly , it ' s 20mm not 21mm . i really like the echo drive no need to worry about batteries . 
i ' m a fan of citizen eco - drive chronographs . what can i say , they are just great watches ! this is my 3rd ( not a replacement . all are still working ) . i was looking for a " field watch " to wear when out kayaking , camping , hiking , etc , instead of wearing my other two which are dress - type watches . i even purchased an inexpensivecasio foresterfor the task . however , i ' m just so used to the quality and durability of the eco - drive chronographs , i said " to heck with it " and treated myself to this jewel ! my oldest eco is 7yrs old , next is 2 yrs old , plus this new one . all run great and i ' ve never had to replace or repair one , and believe me , i am rough on watches . i never take them off unless i ' m swapping one watch for another . i didn ' t really care for the band , but it wasn ' t really an issue since i knew i was going to replace it with a self made band , immediately ( see pic ) . i have other nice watches such as seiko kinetics , but they just stay in the watch case . . . . . 
this is everything i wanted in a watch . the eco - drive is an accurate movement which never needs batteries , the chronograph ( stopwatch ) feature is the only extra feature i get much use of in a watch , and the stainless steel case / water resistance to 100m means i can wear it every day without worrying that i ' ll wreck it . some notes on the watch . the picture of the face is accurate - easy to read numbers and hands . the second hand is not the red sweep hand pointing at 12 : 00 ; that ' s the stopwatch hand . the second hand is the small dial at 6 : 00 , which takes about 30 seconds to get used to . the band is more of a true olive green ( like military duffel bags ) than the deep green pictured . and finally , the ' holes ' for the buckle have grommets around them , which means they are farther apart than on a leather band , and while fit is not difficult even with this feature , it ' s worth noting . also , the canvas strap has a leather ( or pleather ) lining , which makes it more comfortable on the skin . the watch is easy to set . the date is a number only , so when months pass that have 30 days or less , you have to advance it manually . as is , it ' s a great military field style watch . big and easy to read , with long - lasting luminescence on the hands and the hours . i currently own a metal - band , dressy citizen watch with lots of ( useless ) features , and if this keeps time / charge like that one , then it ' s going to be steady and reliable . i ' m very happy with this purchase . . . . . . especially since i replaced the canvas band with a leather band ( http : / / www . amazon . com / hadley - roma - msm894rb - 200 - 20 - mm - genuine - leather / dp / b001f0ptxc / ref = sr_1_2 ? s = watches & ie ; = utf8 & qid ; = 1397935533 & sr ; = 1 - 2 & keywords ; = hadley + roma ) . now it looks like this watch : http : / / www . amazon . com / citizen - bl5250 - 02l - eco - drive - leather - titanium / dp / b000eqs0wk / ref = sr_1_1 ? s = watches & ie ; = utf8 & qid ; = 1397936104 & sr ; = 1 - 1 & keywords ; = citizen ; which is amazing . it looks both rugged and dressy . i ' m thrilled . for tips on replacing watch bands , this is a great resource - i did mine with a knife in about 5 minutes . [ . . . ] 
when i first received the watch , i ' ve got to admit that i was a bit disappointed ( it was that ugly canvas watchband ) . however , after wearing the watch for several weeks and replacing the band , it ' s become my favorite everyday watch . it has a casual and dressy look and feel . at a price point of $ 117 , it ' s an excellent value ! the features that i enjoy about this watch : 1 ) the watch is a lot thinner than i expected . some guys like a big heavy watch . i don ' t . 2 ) no battery . this can be costly to replace and the battery always dies when you don ' t want it to die , e . g . , on a trip in the middle of nowhere . 3 ) the hour and minute hands illuminate very brightly in the dark . 4 ) second hand sweep that works exactly like a stopwatch . 5 ) it looks and feels damn good on my wrist ! features that i don ' t like : 1 ) like every other reviewer , i found the canvas watchband to be ugly . i replaced mine with a " swiss army - type " rubberized band that is smooth and looks dressy ( $ 8 . 00 to replace ) . don ' t replace it with a rugged timex " ironman " or casio watch band since it won ' t look good . 2 ) the three smaller dials are too small for my old eyes ; however , that ' s my problem . bigger dials aren ' t possible without making the watch bigger . in conclusion , i give this watch two thumbs up . i deducted one - star for the ugly canvas watchband . however , replacing the canvas watchband is easy and cheap . 
nice watch , but too small for me to really want to wear it . i gifted it to myself so i am going to re gift it to someone . 
had this watch for a month now . good quality . like others , i replaced the band . i have small wrists and it was still pretty short . i liked the look of the band but couldn ' t get it to fit snug enough . the lume is not the greatest but works . 
i love this product . i bought the lesser expensive model ( without a chronograph ) several years ago , and finally bought this one because it just looks so nice . it ' s great . i get compliments on it frequently . it ' s certainly not something i ' d wear with a suit , but it ' s perfect for wearing around the house . i wear the other model for working around the house . 
my biggest concern when buying this watch was band size . i am 6 ' 1 and 200 pounds , so after reading many reviews , i was a bit worried that it would not fit or strangle my arm . i got the watch , and put it on and had 3 spare loops for adjustment . i believe you would have to have a very large are for the size of the band to be an issue . there hasnt been much sun around the past 7 days or so and that made me a bit nervous as to how well the watch would run out of the box , but it seems that light from in the house is plenty sufficient . very nice looking watch that goes well in all settings . 
i love it ! great weekend time piece . i was amazed at the quality of it . i really enjoy all the features and will probably order two more to gift . 
watch looks nice . but it does not feel the same . the strap is a little small for chubby guys like me . i got to use it on the second hole and i not any big at all . not many functions and very basic calendar . i think you should spend a few more dollars and buy made completely of stainless steel or even better titanium . 
i really like the watch . the band looks ugly in the pictures but is actually really nice . good looking watch . ib thought i was luminous but really only glow in the dark . still , great watch at good price . 
i think the watch looks better in person then on the internet . it ' s large and easy to read . the only thing that takes one star off is the band . yes , i knew it was ugly when i ordered it , but that ' s not the problem . i have an average size wrist , and i wear the watch on the second to last hole , using the very last hole when i work out . besides the band being too short , it ' s a great watch , and well worth the price . 
the watch was nice but the band was a strange color and design . citzen makes a good watch it was a shame to return because of the band 
very very good ! perfect quality ! same as described ! i like it very much ! very beautiful and cool ! thank you 
this was a christmas gift and i absolutely love it . the black on white design makes it extremely easy to read and it looks great . setting the watch was a bit time consuming but following the steps in the included dvd made it easy to do . love the perpetual calendar . having just come out of february , this is the only watch i have that i did not have to adjust the date on . i ' m still amazed at how long the hands glow in the dark . no light but who needs one ! this was my first deployment clasp watch and it took me a while to figure out how to size it , but once i did , i had to laugh because it was so simple . on the underside of the silver bar that goes across the band , there ' s a little piece that flips up so that you can adjust which hole it engages . the band takes a bit of getting used to , but i now find it very comfortable and easy to use . love the eco - drive concept . no batteries and no watch winder . ambient light seems to be enough to keep it going - i haven ' t made any special efforts to keep my wrist in the sunlight or anything : ) . it even has a warning when the charge is low - or so i ' ve read - haven ' t seen it - where the second hand starts moving every other second ( still keeping proper time ) , so that you can see if it ' s getting low . overall , i think that this is a unique and fine looking watch . i ' ve recieved compliments every time i ' ve worn it . 
i ordered this watch few days back from jomashop and received today . i was eagerly waiting for it and believe me this is so very pretty than the pics advertised on the website . i ordered bl8000 - 03a instead of 54l because i personally don ' t like much of blue dial and also ss strap sometimes pinches my wrist hair . in all other reviews mostly all the functionality is covered so i will not repeat the same thing . just want to mention leather strap with this watch is not normal leather strap but with a folding clasp ( you can check its video on youtube ) . also it is very comfortable on wrist and perfectly weighted . i just have one doubt about the water resistant feature of this or any leather strap watch - how can any leather strap watch be worn while swimming . . i mean wouldnt it damage the leather strap fast . . . . 
i bought this watch while my wife and i were on a cruise down in the cayman islands about 4 year ago . i had always wanted a nice watch and always settled with timex , so to step up to a citizen was great . i ' ve had the watch for the past 4 years and it ' s still in great condition . i love that it ' s light powered so there is no messing with a battery . it ' s entertaining to get up in the morning and turn on the light and see the hour and minute hands start spinning to catch up to the current time . i love the technology on this thing . not once have i had to adjust the date , replace a battery , or the wrist strap and i wear this thing 5 days a week to work . i ' ve dropped it a few time and even hit it pretty hard on metal cabinets on accident and there are no scratches on the face . it ' s a great watch , it ' s a touch watch , i really do love this watch . highly recommend it . 
i feel like , & # 34 ; what can one say when one word can pretty much sum it up ? how about & # 34 ; perfect & # 34 ; . i get comments on this all the time - - it ' s very classy , wears well , keeps time great , and is , well , just awesome . it looks and feels like it costs 10x what i paid . the only thing about this watch is that it ' s challenging to adjust or set an alarm . i don ' t use any of those features , to be fair , so perhaps i ' d get more used to it if i used it for that . cell phones and other gadgets have replaced those needs for me , but when i wanted to use it , i certainly had to get out the manual and read it carefully . not worth it . but for me , it ' s worth it just to have it as a classy , solidly build timepiece that draws just enough attention to it that it stays classy . i never get tired of looking at its pearl - white - like bezel coloring , the deep , rich blacks in the face ( and the band ) . and the clasp is well built . love this watch . 
i picked this one up . a little cheaper than i see here on amazon . for the price i paid , i like it . i like the fact that it has an alarm . i have read other reviews about the alrm being too quiet . i don ' t use mine to wake up , i use it as a reminder . it ' s fine for me . it ' s a nice looking watch . i ' ve owned it for a few months and haven ' t had any strap issues . i like this more as a suit watch , not so much casual wear . the contrast on the face is not as bold as it looks in these photos . i like it overall . 
good looking watch . get lots of compliments . however within 4 - 5 weeks the crown is not locking into place any more . i also have one small stress crack on the face already , and i work in an office ! this was my first citizen watch and likely my last . will stick to my swiss made watches from now on . 
i ' m glad this watch has a perpetual calendar , because it is dang hard to set the first time . i finally got it set . as long as it never stops i think i ' ll be okay . otherwise it looks very nice and keeps good time . but seriously , if i ever buy another watch with this many complications , i ' ll get one of those watches that sets itself from radio signals . 
great looking watch for any occasion . citizen watch are very durable and draw the attention of others but are very reasonably priced . 
after opening the box , my first impression was . . . . imitation . it had a cheap , chinsey feel to it . . . unlike the other timepieces i own . but i figured i ' d give it a try and see what happens . unfortunately , you need to have a technical degree or be a nuclear physicist to figure out how to set the time , let alone the date etc . . . . seriously , i had read in the reviews it was difficult to set , but the reality was much worse . . . the cheap feel , coupled with the difficulty in setting it , plus the fact that it ' s not a true chronograph deemed it worthless and i returned it the same day . 
ok some people complained about setting instructions on this thing . . must say they are a pain to find the correct ones . with that said here you go : the movement caliber # is e820 [ . . . ] with the above info you can setup this watch in under 5 mins . now that settings are covered about the watch . the watch is great , lightweight , with the right size of face . at night you can see the dial good with the luminescence . bottom line is with this watch after setting it up correctly , you ' ll never need a new battery or have to change the date again in your lifetime ! ! ! ! ! ! 
really like this watch . all components are high quality and the watch looks nice with dress or casual wear . the strap is very stiff but is starting to loosen up with use . wish citizen had replaced the 1 / 20 second dial with a day indicator as i don ' t use the tachymeter function and would have preferred to have the day of week indicated . i have no problem reading any of the dial info and although the watch looks heavy , the titanium case keeps everthing light . proud to have this as part of my collection . i am only buying light powered watches as i usually keep 5 to 10 watches in my collection at a time . battery replacement was becoming a real hassle not to mention a considerable expense ( my tag heuer costs me $ 250 . 00 every 2 - 3 yrs for battery replacements ) . 
bought it for my husband on his bd . he loves it because of its look and the fact that he doesn ' t have to change the battery at all . he has passion for watch and very picky about it . but he likes it and wear it pretty often . 
after some research , i sort of switched from seiko to citizen - - - better warranty , eco - drive better than kinetic ( lasts longer , less " temperamental " ) , apparently cheaper servicing costs . very good looking and well made . i prefer to the 8700 models just due to looks ( although i would like a day of the week indicator ) . is perpetual ( nice but not that big a deal ) , eco - drive ( sweet - - - 30 year life expected ! ! ! ) , chronograph ( probably will not be used ) , alarm ( too low to really be any good ) . nice looks , good strap . stainless ( 316l ) and titanium combo . uses luminova , not superluminova to see in the dark ( modest disappointment ) . why only 4 stars ? mineral crystal . i ' d pay $ 50 more for it , but it ' s not here . to a lesser extent , some corners were cut a bit . chinese leather and bezel is cheap - - - paint can come off and moving it is not a peak experience . finally , date could be easier to read for those of us with aging eyes ( especially make sense on a perpetual . recommended . might last 20 years . only challenge to this is the $ 330 - $ 360 hamilton khaki automatic ( i like the 42mm ) . just tells time and date but a bit higher quality ( smooth winding , bit better strap , automatic , sapphire , swiss made - - - not just swiss movement , see - thru back , and a wwi classic . can ' t go wrong either way . recommended ( amazon sells 8700 which some prefer although some prefer this for $ 375 including bracelet . ) amazon does a very good job whatever you buy . 
a not too busy version of a citizen chronograph . yes it ' s solar powered , yes it ' s got dual time , yes alarm , yes chronograph . it ' s also waterproof and has perpetual date . my new watch came with the date off so i had too re - set it . the problem is the directions are out - dated for older citizen watches , and had to go online to learn pulling the crown all the way out , and hitting the a button is the way to get to date settings , and rotating the crown changes the date . it works perfectly , just make sure the directions for set - up are correct . lol 
i love this watch . i have about a dozen , and this is my favorite . i only with i had the titanium band of the 53l version . 
first let me say i never give anything 5 stars , as everything can be improved . however , this watch deserves 4 . 5 , alas it is not available . i received citizens bl5250 - 02l eco - drive perpetual watch today . very pleased with face of watch , absolutely beautiful . it is a medium large watch but is a little thicker than i would like , but how they get all that incredible technology in a watch i guess i can understand the need for the thickness . the solar eco - drive and perpetual calendar were deal makers , and to top it off the all titanium body and st . steel base make it perfect . this watch needs to be titanium , otherwise i think it would be too heavy . the weight seemed about perfect for a watch of this style . i like leather bands , especially brown , but this is a personal preference , but it did influence my purchase in a positive way , just a little . now , i read several reviews about the difficulty setting the watch . please reference & lt ; . . . > , this will make it quite easy . plus , once its set you never have to set it again ! ! ! i set the l - tm ( local time ) to dst which works for me since i don ' t do much traveling , and just swap between l - tm and tme ( time ) as needed twice a year . it is rare for me to spend this much on a watch , but my lust got the best of me . i simply am a sucker for watches . this will be one of my favorites i ' m sure . the rotating bezel is highly polished and some said this made the watch look cheap , i don ' t agree , but this too is an individual preference . i love a rotating bezel as i use the bezel frequently when i need a simple , quick ' time elapsed ' available to me . i am a scuba diver , but would use one of my cheaper diving watches instead of this beaut . i would like to see the second band retaining loop a little tighter fit . some have complained about not having a day , i . e . , thur , fri , sat , etc . , sub - dial , however , the face would simply be too crowed . this three sub - dial look is beautiful , and traditional . i guess those who travel across the date - line may need a day indicator , but most of use know what day it is , just check your iphone if this is a problem ? ! a watch of this caliber is not meant to be a computer , just a beautiful time piece , at that it is ! no one watch can meet everyones need , but for me this is as close as it gets . i will update review if there is a problem i encounter . i will update if i encounter a problem . i highly recommend this watch . 
i purchased this as a gift for a special guy . he was thrilled . the band , which has received some negative feedback , is really quite nice . i refer to this as his & # 34 ; power watch . & # 34 ; it is handsome . he will never have to set the calendar , etc . for the price , it really is spectacular . 
i have definitely loved the drive that citizen has made into their watches , time and time again . while they haven ' t actually shown it to the fullest extent with their drive 3 . 0 line , they have continued to mainly show it with their classics . this mens ' eco - drive timepiece is definitely one for the trendy , and the timeless . it is a class and sporty watch that is easy to setup and tell the time . i also like the features on the watch from the perpetual motion , to the easy to setup date and time and chronograph . my only grip about the watch is that i wish that it could ' ve had a bit more from the illumination of the hands . i also had wished that the leather strap wouldn ' t wear down so easily . but nevertheless , despite a few flaws . you really do get a good watch from citizen worth its dollar . price : bsetup & comfort : b 1 / 2 + overall : b 
i bought this watch primarily for the look of it . i was not upset when it arrived . the watch is absolutely stunning . i get tons of compliments on it and it easily became my favorite watch in my collection . the manuals are confusing and setting the watch is also confusing but from reading the reviews i knew this going into it . you can find instructions on youtube that are more intuitive than the directions . once set and on my arm i can ' t say enough about the watch . it feels quality , its that great in between of not too expensive and not too cheap yet fits any occassion . 
the watch does everything i expected it to do . it has a wide face with a stainless steel bezel over a titanium body . i ' ve owned many of the best and this watch compares with any of the lot . the only fault i found was the small watchband which easily can be replaced ( which i did ) . as far as set up , it ' s a snap for those who own blancpain or any other high quality chronometer to set the watch . you get what you pay for . . . addendum after a year my review is pretty much the same . but , the crystal has pitted and scratched to a point i ' ll have to have it replaced . you can bet i won ' t skimp on price . i want a sapphire crystal ! ! 
i ' ve been looking to purchase this citizen time piece from amazon for the last few months , but never could pull the trigger . to my surprise , i rec ' d it as a anniversary gift from my gf just last week : - d at first impression out of the box , overall the fit and finish is of high quality and fits the price point . on the negative sides , the directions ( manual and cd - rom ) makes setting up the time , calendar , date on the watch way too complicated . i found myself going over it over and over again till i happen to stumble upon the right sequences to set the watch correctly . i ' m an avid watch collector and some of my very high end time pieces are easier to set up than this watch from citizen . the alarm is perfect and does the job of waking me up from my slumber . i have yet to see the effectiveness and potental of the perpertual calendar . the uni - directional bezel is way to tight when turning counter - clockwise , i almost thought it was defective at first . the luminous hands , dial markers and center mark on the bezel shine brightly . overall , i like this time piece from citizen and welcome it into my ever expanding collection of wrist watches . 
i ' ve been lusting after this watch for about a month and finally bought it - i couldn ' t be happier . i ' ve read most of the reviews and will attempt not to repeat those in detail . so , here ' s my observations : 1 ) i wanted a watch with a brown leather band with a " rugged look " without being clunky . i saw this and thought it would work , but was a bit put off by the pictures on amazon ' s site . when i finally got the watch , i was very pleasantly surprised that the actual watch looked much better in real life than the pictures on the site . some reviewers say the watch and / or band was " shiny " and not to their liking . i find the leather band looks rich and the " chrome " look on the bezel enhanced the looks since it was much less " silvery " looking than a brushed silver finish would be . amazing how tastes vary amongst people . 2 ) i ' ve made a kind of pact with myself that since i ' m a " watch person " with over 20 in my collection , that i would no longer buy watches that require batteries , and would also strive to buy watches with a wireless timekeeping connection . okay , so this watch doesn ' t have the wireless timekeeping connection , but it is solar powered . a big plus . 3 ) the perpetual calendar is great . 4 ) the watch ( for the week that i ' ve had it ) is keeping time within seconds of the atomic clock in boulder . 5 ) i like the tachymeter function for the few times i want to calibrate my car ' s speedometer and for those other times when i ' m surreptitiously measuring manufacturing times in factories i visit in asia . having said all that , there are a few nits : 1 ) the alarm is really non - existent . okay , i ' m an older guy , but i can ' t really hear the alarm unless i ' m specifically listening to it . and , it ' s a bear to set . seiko owns the market on loud wrist watch alarms and also on luminous hands , numerals , etc . 2 ) the stop watch function is really rudimentary . having to pull out the crown and rotate it to change to the stop watch mode is really cumbersome . once you pull out the crown , rotate it , push it back in , and push the start / stop button you ' ve probably missed what you wanted to time . and then , you only have a start - stop function - no lap function . and , to reset the stop watch , a long push on the start / stop button does it - totally counter - intuitive since normally if the top right button starts & stops the timing , the bottom right button resets it . bottom line : i like the watch for what i bought it for - it ' s probably one of the better looking watches i own - i would buy it again and recommend it to a friend . 
watch received in great condition . many people seems to have problem adjusting the watch timing and calendar e . t . ci realised that it might be the fact that they were reading the first section of the user guidance that was meant for a different watch model . the guidance for this watch is located in the 2nd section . 
i love this watch . it is so nice . i found very good directions to set it on citizen ' s website . it looks great and is very precise . it ' s quality is high and it ' s look impeccable . i would buy another . 
reviewers who have said the watch looks better in person are right . it looks great on amazon , but looks even better in person . it is an eye catcher for sure . looks classy and substantial like a man ' s watch should . i took just a few minutes to review the booklet that came with hit on how to set it , and it was not that hard . have not messed with alarm yet , but shouldn ' t be too hard . looks great with a suit / tie or shorts / tee / flips . the eco - drive is just cool . this watch looks tons more expensive than it is . it feels substantial on your arm , but not blocky heavy . good size . very happy with it . update : may 2012 : still like the watch . still looks great . very hard to move time ahead and back in timezones and when time changes etc . but once set , it ' s awesome . the looks and style still outweigh this small issue . others may " get it " and be able to set it fine back and forth . may just be me . 
this watch looks slick . i noticed that other people had trouble setting the time . it can be difficult but i just followed the directions on the watch and with some patience got it set correctly . i wear this watch everyday . i haven ' t noticed any of the second hand problems people have mentioned . it took a couple of days for the band to feel comfortable but now it does . the box it comes with is pretty cool looking too . i am excited to no longer have a need to buy batteries . 
i bought this for my husband for his birthday , and he loves it . he has a slimmer wrist , and all the watches i looked at were so big that i didn ' t even try them . then i found this one and it is a great size , both in diameter and thickness . it ' s very good looking - can be worn for both dress - up and casual . i highly recommend , especially if you want a watch that is smaller in size . 
this watch is great , inexpensive and flash looking . it has a fancy sound name and looks good on your wrist for any occasion . i highly recommend this product . 
well i looked at this watch for a long time before purchasing . at the same time i also bought the version with the brown band . these are great though the band leaves a lot to be desired . i know that can be disheartening to some but i still would go with this watch over other options . 
i loved this watch ! i desagree with some people stating that its too small to be a mans watch . i think its a great fit ! also , i saw someone complain that the date was in spanish and not in english ; you have both and you ge to choose in what language to have it in ! 
i like this watch , i especially like it for 90 dollars . first , for those who like to just feel as though they god a deal - - citizen lists this watch on their website as $ 215 , not the 150 that amazon puts as the list price . at 36mm its nice for a smaller wrist ( though i did chose to order a short band for it ) and still looks like a man ' s watch . the style is a little bit bauhaus and a little bit skaggen - brand though i expect the watch exceeds skaggen - brand quality . i like the 12 / 4 / 8 numbers so that the day date window does not interfere with the numbering symmetry - - clever and the numbers are nice and thin so with a glancing look the just seem like hashmarks . for what it is it is terrific - - a nice watch for a non - labor work environment . if you want a rugged piece of industrial equipment - - definitely not the watch for you . looks professional without being arrogant . it is simple with no unneeded markings or complications . eco - drive is a nice feature . at a 90 dollars , you don ' t really have to lose sleep that someone will mug you for it or if you accidentally bash the ying - yang out of it you haven ' t exactly ruined your future . 
when it has came down to citizen after all these years , they still definitely know how to really make excellent watches for everyone . but there are those that really don ' t want too many gimmicks in their watches . fortunately , they can make that with this eco - drive black leather watch . it doesn ' t have all the gimmicks that other watches have , keeping it simple with each tick of the watch , from its beautiful leather strap , to telling time with its built - in eco - drive technology by never running out of energy by natural and even your house lights in the living room . it really never stops ticking . it really is worth its money for anyone who wants a high - quality watch , without the strain from your wallet . i absolutely recommend citizen as one of the best brand watches for all your everyday needs . this watch designed with a leather strap , does it all , and i absolutely recommend this for the man in everyday quality . price : bconvience : b + quality : b 1 / 2 + overall : b 1 / 2 + 
best of pros : you never need a battery ! this is just awesome . worst of cons : the strap isn ' t soft enough in my opinion . 
bought and then returned it . . . the face of the watch is really small and almost looks like a womans watch . i like my watch faces over sized . this one just didn ' t do anything for me . . . 
this was a gift for my son but he seemed pleased with it . guess i ' ll check with him on how it works 
bought this as a gift for a friend who is not really into watches , i figured i ' d get him an eco - drive so he wouldn ' t have to worry about battery changes / handwinding / watch box etc . this watch is perfect for him ; it ' s easy to read , good - looking , low maintenance , and it was a great deal for me ( i got myself the bm6400 , another fantastic watch ) . bottom line , you can ' t go wrong if you like the looks , the only complaint i have is that the band isn ' t really that great , i feel like the holes are too far apart to allow you to get a good fit ( either slightly too loose or slightly too tight ) . that ' s an easy fix though . . . 10 bucks on natostrapco or crownandbuckle and you ' ve got the solution : ) 
i bought this watch to wear on the weekends so i don ' t beat up my good watches . i knew the band would be small and weak but i had an older expansion type band from another watch . when the watch arrived i cut off the canvas band , put on the metal band set the time and date and put it out in the sun for the rest of the afternoon . i have not touched it since ! ! i select and wind what good watch i want to wear during the week and when saturday morning comes i grab this one , put it on and go ! the luminous hands and markers are very bright at night ! i am a large guy and a larger dial would have been nice . however if you can get an eco - drive that never needs a battery for this price that is alway set and ready to go after sitting in the dark for a week then you have the perfect weekend watch . this is the only citizen watch i have ever owned so i cannot attest to durability . accuracy has been dead on ! i guess since all the wr - 100 / 200s have the same movement pick the one that suits you and you are all set . i would buy this watch again and will buy another if i ever need to do so . good job by amazon on delivery , good job by citizen to make a reliable product that is technologically advanced and fits the needs of most guys . 
the watch looks good and as with all citizen products it keeps great time . my only caution is that the band is more green than some of the pictures look . now i ' m also a little color blind , so take that for what it ' s worth . but to me , i was a little surprised at the color of the band . i was hoping for a darker green . i ' ll probably end up replacing the band . 
this is a great looking watch and very comfortable . when i bought it , i added a replacement watch band to my shopping cart because i just * knew * i wouldn ' t like the band on this watch . i was wrong - i love the band on this watch and plan to keep it . like some people already stated , the band is a bit stiff when putting on the watch , but once it is on it ' s very comfortable . the dial has an expensive look to it . the movement is quartz , so of course it ' s super accurate . 
i had not worn a wristwatch in the 11 years since retiring and had decided it was time to be a & # 34 ; big boy & # 34 ; again , i wanted something simple to view yet accurate , dependable and durable . the canvas strap is comfortable and secure , and the watch keeps accurate time . 
this is a beautiful , simple watch . it does nothing special . however , it is the right size ( not too big ) ; it is very easy to read with great contrast between the black face and white numerals and hands ; it is also nicely luminescent so i have no trouble reading it in the dark . i happened to have an 18mm leather watch strap from the timex that broke , so i switched that strap onto this citizen . that makes it look like an understated elegant day - to - day watch , rather than a quasi - military watch with the cloth strap . what i appreciate most , though , is the exactness . . . the second hand always exactly aligns with one of the 60 indicators around the dial ; the day and date are perfectly aligned within their respective window . it provides a sense of being well crafted . 
this watch has a solid feel without being clunky . it is large without being oversize , and doesn ' t have those ridiculous knobs and bells and whistles that & # 34 ; prestige & # 34 ; men ' s watches often feature . the band is sturdy . in the 48 hours i have had it , it has kept time accurate to the second . so far , so good ! 
i purchased this from amazon for about $ 84 recently . i was looking for a basic , grab - and - go watch that didn ' t need a lot of maintenance . if you have had & # 34 ; value & # 34 ; priced chrono - watches , you know that it can be pain to keep each hand - set synched . this is a very basic watch thus much less messing around . pros : * * eco - drive , it ' s going to run for a long while . * * fit and finish of the case is very nice . * * my hands are right on each mark . no offset for me . cons : * * the green strap is complete junk . i replaced it will a black leather band . * * small . . . reminds me of a timex metal field watch in size and weight . * * 18mm lugs are tiny . probably the best non - automatic basic watch out there . for men , i recommend buying a 22mm band and slicing the lug interface down to 18mm to give the watch a more substantial look and feel . honestly , it would be nice for women as well . this isn ' t a thick / large watch . 
this is a fine watch and keeps excellent time . i purchased it due to its ' appearance which was similsr to a watch issued in 1970 ' s era which was a wind watch but had sentimental value . it is long gone but this one is a excellent replacement . 
this is the first new watch i ' ve purchased in many years , and so far , i love it . a handsome , but simple and easy - to - see face with day and date , with accurate timekeeping . i get the impression from other reviews that a lot of guys got this watch for the same reason i did . . . . sick and tired of watches that die after 12 to 24 months and then spending anything from $ 5 to $ 10 to install a new battery . the citizen eco - drive is charged by the sun ( or indoor light ) , so it ' s enviromentally friendly . the one thing that kept the watch from getting 5 stars , and the very gripe others have expressed , is the band . i ' m a slender guy , with smaller - than - average wrists , and even on my arm , the band was too small , with no ' happy medium ' . at the 2 - hole setting , it will stay on my wrist , but moves around . at 3 holes , it cuts off the circulation . there are 7 holes total , and i can ' t imagine anyone , not even an extremely petite woman or very small child using the 7th hole . citizen must have designed this using those ultra - slim asian wrists in mind ( citizen is based in tokyo ) . they should really consider giving this otherwise excellent watch a different band . 
bf loves it . no batteries , eco - drive runs correctly with no slowdown , no need to re - adjust , easy to set , larger read - out day and date than other watches , easy to read , sturdy and attractive . changed strap to a metal expandable , he didn ' t like fussing with the rather stiff canvas strap that came with it . excellent watch for the price . he looks at it often . best christmas gift ever . 
i have had this watch for 3 . 5 years now , with no major complaints , finding it to be a great everyday use watch . this may sound preposterous , but i purchased this as a replacement for a rolex submariner that i received as a gift 20 years ago . the rolex was a great watch , although a bit big and heavy . servicing it was more than the cost of this watch , and the latest repair would probably be ten times the cost , so into the safety deposit box the rolex went . i do miss the ability of the rolex to be completely submerged , having used it as a dive watch for years before giving up the sport , but the citizen is much better for everyday use . it is hard to find tasteful , well made , and reasonably priced watches , which i believe the citizen mostly satisfies . with the exception of the strap , that is . i did not care for the big metal grommets for the holes , but it was otherwise ok . the watch is not too gaudy , with plenty of function , including an easy to read dial , second hand , and day / date . as noted , i did not care for the strap and suspected that the leather / nylon material would get a bit funky with use , as others have noted . after a year or so , i replaced it with a plain nylon olive drab band that is a little easier to keep clean and odor free . as for accuracy , the watch requires only a 1 - 2 minute adjustment every few months , if that . anyone that has come from a self - winding watch ( even high end models from my limited exposure ) , should know the need for regular adjustments . my rolex was off by several minutes every month , so i was happy to not have to adjust a watch as often . my job requires a high level of precision , so having a good , accurate timepiece is a necessity , and this watch does that . this is all based upon the online navy atomic clock as my reference time , not one of those radio synchronised clocks , which i find to vary widely . as noted , the dial is easy to read , with the day / date function very useful for those of us confused about the day of the week ( i ' m a bit absent minded about the year at times ! ) . the black face makes it easy to read the dial . nighttime viewing is not as great as a doped display , but acceptable for the cost ( not electroluminescent , alas ) . the crown is protected by arms on either side , which is a welcome touch for those of us not so coordinated , and i have not had any issues with the crown or arms . the crystal sits proud of the surface , as crystals usually do , but i rather wish it had some sort of raised protection outside it , as the crystal has become very well scratched with use . the scratches have only been more noticeable in the last year , so it is not all bad , and the watch is still readable . if i get another two years out of the watch , it will be a good value in my opinion , and if the watch is still for sale , i will probably order another one from amazon ( rather tempted to order one now and set it aside ) . coming from the scratchless sapphire crystal of a rolex , i assumed this would happen , so i cannot say i am surprised . a sapphire crystal would probably make the watch too expensive ( although i wish it were an option , if citizen is reading this ) , and as i well know , sapphire crystals are easily shattered from three foot drops onto hard tile floors . . . so the crystal used is a fair trade i suppose . one of the selling points to the watch is the eco - drive function , which as is illustrated with the watch listing , charges the built - in battery using available light from the dial ' s nearly perfectly hidden , baked - in solar cell . this was what finally sold me on this match , as i dislike quartz watches and their annoying battery replacements ( i own several seiko quartz watches ) . the battery in the eco - drive is supposed to last 20 years if i recall correctly , so i expect it will outlast the crystal ( see above ) . given the strap issue and scratching i ' m taking away one star , but still like , and use the watch daily . it is a great watch with caveats , and recommended . 
i purchased this watch for my husband several weeks ago , as his watches always needed battery replacements often . my husband and i both like that fact that it ' s eco - drive , so hopefully it will last a long time . it was pretty easy to set up . we even let it sit under a florescent lamp for a few days just to be sure it would work well . i also took the suggestion from other reviewers and purchased a separate watch strap , as the one that comes with it is a bit bulky and stiff . i bought a maratac mil series nato 18mm strap in black from & lt ; [ . . . ] > , as per a reviewer ' s suggestion because he said it works well when typing on a keyboard all day at work ( the buckle is on the side of the wrist , not the bottom ) . overall , my husband is really happy with the watch ( and he really likes the replacement strap i bought too ) . 
love the watch , the strap is identical to the other citizen chronograph canvas strap model . for the me the strap is too short on both models for my wrist . the strap looks " silly " with the metal eyelets in the strap . that being said the watch is masculine and functional . an excellent value for an eco - drive model . the case is a polished stainless steel which is the opposite of what a military outdoor watch should be . the case would be better served with a non - reflective matte finish . i believe this was a compromise by citizen to make it appeal to those looking for a fashion dress watch . bottom line great watch , great value , a steal at this price given the eco - drive and quality of a citizen watch . 
amazing product ! i recommend it whole - heartedly ! ! ! it is relatively cheap but gives a lot : good - looking , reliable , comfortable , gives the time and day of the month and day of the week . don ' t hesitate and buy it ! 
i was looking for an understated casual watch and this fits the bill . to many watches today have huge faces and look oversize on the average wrist . the eco - drive is a plus . no batteries . the only criticisms i have are regarding the band . the adjustment holes are lined with stainless grommets , and because they are slightly thinker than the band , taking on and off is harder than usual . also because they used canvas for the band instead of nylon , its lined with leather . that guarantees trouble if you sweat in it or get it wet . a nylon band would have been better . an easy fix , but one you shouldn ' t have to make . 
i have now been wearing this daily for about 2 + years . accuracy has been near perfect with very few periodic time adjustments . there have been no service outages and only 1 complete battery drain event - my fault . the watch recharges quickly and runs for days without light . sunlight charges the watch much faster than incandescent , in my opinion - no surprises there . the strap has been durable and very comfortable . given a couple more years of use , the strap will likely need to be replaced . the fit of the watch on my wrist is perfect and the dial / hands is easy to read , even in the dark . 
my wife wanted a fashion watch like all the girls are wearing now , so i suggested this little baby . she saw it , liked it , and amazon had the best price . she is now wearing this and getting good comments and compliments . it is a great casual female accessory piece , plus it is practical , attractive , no battery , and keeps good time . most important , she likes it and is pleased with her purchase . thanks amazon ! 
perfect for my son to wear when he started college . numbers are big and easy to read without interference with all the unnecessary fancy chronograph dials . basic in style and appropriate for casual or dress . love the fact that it doesn ' t need batteries . feel more secure that it won ' t suddenly stop and screw up time reading for the day . also hate having the hassle of buying so many batteries for our watches and the danger of not doing it quick enough to avoid battery leakage . 
i like this watch because easy to read the time with date n day and gives a reliable correct time / day n date and i trusted citizen brand is quality . the only thing i dont like it is not luminous at night / dark environment . . . . . . . you cant see / read the time 
i love this watch face , and it is a very good watch for the price thus far . the band is not the most attractive , but after i swapped it out for a leather band this watch has become a great watch for the office . it doesn ' t have a huge face , but is big enough to see at a quick glance . 
returned this watch for a refund - was the band in the photo hidden for a reason ? i have canvas bands that are presentable - this was not 
i ' ve owned the watch for 3 months and worn it every day . just today i swapped out the band for a 4 $ walmart black 1 - piece ( similar to the maratac ones ) . i ' m glad i switched bands . i tried to live with it after reading all the negative reviews , but it was sort of getting on my nerves . as you ' ve probably read before , the metal grommets are too large , so 1 eyelet will be too loose , leading to the watch " leaning " away from the center of your wrist . and the next one will be too tight . the watch has been very accurate . it ' s comfortable for being a metal piece . the illumination is awesome . i am someone who has always worn casio or timex ' s , and this glow is so much better . just stepping outside for a minute in cloudy weather is enough to make it glow pretty bright . another great thing is that it is completely silent . you can ' t hear the ticking at all . the only cons i can see with this watch is you have to occasionally readjust the date ; and of course the band . 
there is no doubt that citizen has really made some very clever watches with the driven eco - drive brand . they have been definitely worth their money . but yet , there are some that are worth it , but can also be better . that is the case with this canvas strap eco - drive watch . it looks elequent from the face and easy to setup . yet , the problem isn ' t with the watch , it is with the wear of the strap . it can easily tear with time , and it would have to be replaced . yet , there are some watches that work better than others that citizen have made , and this is one of them . if you are looking for a sporty eco - drive , than this would be one worth trying . price : bconvience & setup : c + overall : b - 
i have to say that it didn ' t catch my eyes once i opened the box ! it was nicer on the picture ! this watch isn ' t too bad , but kind of big and heavy - which i didnt like . i normally like very slim and light watches but i saw lots of good reviews about this watch and decided to buy it . but i ended up not liking it , that ' s why i exchanged it with a skagen ( which to me is more elegant ) . what i didn ' t like about this watch : - i have a thin wrist and since the watch was thick , it kind of hurt my wrist bones . also it didnt stay firm on my wrist , it ' d always slide down from one side of my wrist ; and if i tightened it , then it wasn ' t comfortable due to not being well shaped on the back . - the band was hard and definitely not smooth . - heavy and bulky and not well shaped . - the second hand did not line up exactly at 12 . - it came with a sticker stamp on the back , instead of being printed - or carved ( that how looked like on the picture ) . however , it has lots of cool qualifications : no need for battery , good water resistance , seems strong and durable , numbers and hands illuminate very well in the dark . i believe it is a good one for out door activities like hiking , rafting etc . 
i purchased this watch three years ago on amazon . it has been reliable , and great to use . it has a very legible dial with numbers that stand out . the bezel is polished stainless , which looks great and stays clean . it has a nice large crown , making the time easy to set . the solar cell has soaked up enough energy during normal use to keep the watch maintained . i ' ve never had to leave it out in the sun specifically to charge . it ' s a good idea to leave it face up when you take it off though . 
i stumbled onto this watch after having looked at many chronograph types . having read lots of the reviews here i was aware of comments about the band , and now owning the watch , i realize they had a point . on the other hand i like the drab green against the black watch face . so removing the grommets was done to see if it would effect the stiffeness . i discovered the grommets are what makes the band too stiff . the bandmaterial itself is not overly stiff . its all that metal . removing the grommets transforms the band . for example the end of the band now tucks effortlessly into its loop keeper , whereas with the grommets in place it required bending and guiding . heres what it looks like minus the grommets : [ . . . ] [ . . . ] to remove the grommets you need to slide a narrow screwdriverinbetween the grommet and the band on the black side . twist thescrewdrvier and it will displace the grommet a little . do that a fewtimes right next to each other and you will create a lip that canbe grabbed by pliers and the halves of the rivet can be pulledapart . its not hard . dont use more force than necessary . as far as reviews go , i find the combination of never needing to change batteries and the sealed back , plus the no - nonsense look and size of the case , make for a near perfect package . it would be nice if citizen offered a few models that ' riff ' on this one . . for example different face color ( s ) and band choices and case finishes . in itself and for what it was designed to do , its a very very strong product . the price makes it a no brainer . buy one . 
i was looking for a military styled watch and was contemplating buying either this or the seiko snk809 automatic watch . in the end i chose the citizen bm8180 - 03e because it is essentially a battery operated quartz , which means i won ' t have to worry about the watch stopping if i have not worn it for a couple of days . being a quartz , i will not constantly have to adjust the time as quartz watches are generally more accurate than automatics . the solar charging function means that it will require no battery replacements . this is not only environmentally friendly but also saves battery replacement costs . overall , i am very pleased with this watch . it is more beautiful than shown in the picture . the only minor complaint about this watch is that the second hand of my watch does not line up exactly on the seconds marking on the watch ' s dial . still , it is a minor cosmetic imperfection which is common amongst quartz watches which i have owned . 
i love this watch . i got it for christmas and it quickly became my favorite watch . it is easy to read and is a good size , not too big ( like the recent trend has been in watches for some reason ) , but still is ' big ' enough to not look small . really , my only complaint is the band - i really didn ' t like it . i picked up an 18mm leather band for about 12 bucks and it ' s 100 times better . swapping out the band took about 5 minutes and no tools ( with a little fanangling , i was able to pop the old bars out with my fingernails ) . of course , if you are looking for a watch with a bunch of bells and whistles , this isn ' t for you . it is pretty basic - it just tells time and has the day and date . this is just what i wanted in a watch : simple , clean , easy to read , not too big . plus , with the ' eco - drive ' ( solar power ) , you will never have to worry about batteries . this is definitely a quality time piece and i would highly recommend it . 
my husband loves this watch ! it ' s the perfect fishing watch because he ' s not afraid of getting it wet when he fishes . 
i love this watch . i bought it based on internet research only , never saw one in person before . it looks a lot better live than in the pictures . it ' s got a great weight and feel to it , even if the crown is a tad bit protruding , although the fine polish makes it seem less so than the pictures . adjusting the time , day & date is very straight forward . the band is darker than all the pictures i saw , for which i ' m glad , and it ' s comfortable and tough looking . so far no mechanical defaults whatsoever . my only real complaint about this sharp , well - made watch is that the seconds hand does not align with the minute markers on the face . even so , i ' m very satisfied with this watch . 
i ' ve owned this watch for over six months , now and i am very pleased with it . like most citizen watches , it keeps impeccable time . the size of the dial is just right - - not too big , not too small . i like the canvas band . it looks great and has held up quite well . the luminous hands and numbers show up well in the dark . if you are looking for a good traditional military - style watch , you can ' t go wrong with this one . 
i ' ve had this watch for maybe only a few weeks now , and i originally wanted to hold off on writing a review until i had it for quite a while longer , but i like the watch so much that i just have to write one right now . i ' m a man with very small wrists and this watch looks great on my wrist . it ' s the perfect size for me and doesn ' t dominate my wrist in the slightest . it has large face numbers making the time very easy to read , along with a great day and date feature at the 3 o ' clock position . i may have only had the watch for a few weeks , but i ' m someone who never takes off their watch , and my hand frequently bumps into things but so far there aren ' t any scratches or scuffs on the case of the watch . the watch has been just as accurate at the day i set it , which is to be expected of quartz movements . the glow in the dark feature is nice as well , as it allows you to still be able to read the time in the darkness . it lasts for hours too , so you don ' t have to worry about it fading out on you . so far it ' s kept glowing throughout the entire night while i was sleeping , and shuts off when the morning sunlight begins peeking through the curtains . the eco - drive technology sounds great and was another reason i wanted to get the watch . i just like the idea of not having to worry about a watch battery , so far it ' s been great , but i suppose only time will tell just how reliable that feature will be . all in all it ' s a great simple , effective , and quality watch with a very reasonable price tag . 
this is one great watch ! being solar . . no more changing battery costs and the time it take to bring it to a jeweler or have it sent off to be replaced do to it ' being water proof ( special tools needed ) . the watch face is perfect size , if you have a normal size wrest . i hate clunky oversized watches . the band is very non - formal and will need to be replaced after a year or two , if you ' re using this for & # 34 ; blue collar & # 34 ; work . this week i picked up a second watch to use for just & # 34 ; dressing up & # 34 ; and added a black leather band . . . looks great . the band is the : voguestrap tx48318bk allstrap 18mm black regular price : $ 8 . 95 on amazon . hope this helps ! 
great casual watch . first thing i did was to switch the band to a flat rubber watchband ; this actually made the watch appear office quality . love the solar power ; i have been checking the time against the time . gov standard regularly and it has been running consistently 2 - 3 seconds fast each week . this is much much better than my previous ( and much more expensive ) automatic watch . also , i have not had any problems keeping it charged despite wearing long sleeved shirts to work . the watch runs nearly silently . my old automatic had an audible sound in a quiet room from about 2 feet ( right about the distance from my wrist to my ear when typing ) . you have to put the citizen watch on your ear to hear anything . size of the face is perfect for a medium - sized wrist . i prefer smaller watches in general and this is at the upper end of , but well within , my comfort zone . best of all - i get compliments on the watch . small complaint : as others have mentioned , the second hand is fractionally off the mark - not enough to get bothered about . 
this watch meets all my needs : attractive ; easy to see time , day , and date at a glance ; illuminated hands for viewing in poor light or in the dark ; no need to replace battery ; nice looking as a dress watch if you switch the band to black leather ; it ' s fairy thin and is lightweight . the band that comes with the watch is nice . had i not needed a dress watch , i would have kept the band it came with . warning : the manufacturer gives explicit instructions that you should follow . don ' t even try to set the day and date until the watch is fully charged . i hate manuals , but this manual means what it says . all will go smoothly if you follow instructions . i love the watch . 
the watch itself is very nice and i ' m pleased with the purchase . i was hoping for a matte / brushed finish steel body which the pictures suggest is the case . but the watch arrived and the case is polished stainless with a mirror finish . that ' s not ideal but it ' s still a nice watch that i ' ll wear regularly . i replaced the band immediately with a black leather strap which i think is much nicer : http : / / www . amazon . com / gp / product / b00024wc7s / ref = oh_details_o01_s00_i04 ? ie = utf8 & psc ; = 1you ' ll also probably want a watch band replacement tool if you don ' t have one and want to do that job yourself : http : / / www . amazon . com / se - spring - bar - tool - 5in / dp / b005zewgsa / ref = sr_1_1 ? s = watches & ie ; = utf8 & qid ; = 1396286216 & sr ; = 1 - 1 & keywords ; = watch + band + replacement + tool 
i purchased this watch 2 years ago and it has kept time perfectly . i keep it set with the kronos time clock at work and it keeps time with it pretty good . it needs no battery change and is as water tight as i need it to be . i can swim and shower with it on and it just shrugs off the water . it is water resistant to 330 ' ( 75 % of us will never go that deep ) . it ' s luminosity could be better in my opinion , but nothing i can ' t live with and accept given the level of quality in the rest of the watch . the mineral crystal is still smooth and unblemished even after two years . i work with mental patients and have this watch torn off of my wrist on 3 different occasions . it just keeps ticking . the 37mm diameter is perfect for my small wrist . i did change the band to rubber for increased durability . then the rubber broke . currently am using a $ 10 . 00 nylon / velcro band . i wore a seiko 5 for 10 years . it was a good watch but not as accurate as this one . in some of the watch forums , i have seen the question come up of a emp proof watch . some recommend an automatic . for the price though you can buy an extra one of these and store it in a faraday box . these are accurate , lightweight , durable , reliable , good looking and inexpensive . a couple of watchbands of different styles and you could wear it anywhere but an executive meeting or very formal . i currently have the hankering for another watch . not because there is anything wrong with this one . i just like watches . i have been considering a g - shock solar atomic , but i may just have become a severe citizen addict . if you need a good everyday watch , you don ' t have to spend a lot of money . this one fits the bill nicely . buy this watch . you won ' t be sorry . 
this watch may last forever . it ' s solar and never stops going . i also bought a different model with the eco - drive as a gift and that one is going strong , too . these technology is amazing & # 8211 ; i wish it would come to other everyday products in my life ! 
this is a good looking watch . it gains about 2 seconds per week which is good for a low priced quartz watch . i like the green canvas band with leather lining . the watch band is almost too short . someone with a large wrist will find they will have to replace it with a longer band . if it came with a longer band i would have given it 5 stars . 
the band is on the narrow side . i ' m a six foot tall person with average wrist diameter and i ' m out on the 2nd to last hole . someone with a big wrist might be on the last hole or out of luck . the band feels more like plastic than like cloth . at first i wouldn ' t say it ' s overly comfortable however i haven ' t broken it in yet . some people might chose to replace the band . setting the watch was fairly easy however the crown doesn ' t have a definite two position feel to it ( one position to set the time and the other position to set the day and date ) . the watch face has large hands so it ' s easy to tell the time . it ' s hard to see the day and date unless your in pretty good light . the fact that the watch will not need a battery over it ' s lifetime is going to save the cost of several battery replacements which could justify the cost of the watch alone . all in all it ' s a good watch for the money ( thus four stars ) but i would not give the watch five stars because of some of the minor issues listed above . 
my husband purchased this watch after seeing a commercial for the & # 34 ; eco - drive & # 34 ; on tv . he is really happy with the watch . he likes the flexible band and how the watch keeps time . he purchased another citizen eco - drive watch ( for more dressy occasions ) after wearing this one for a while . 
i am extremely upset with my new bm8180 - 03e because the second hand does not align with the marks around the dial , instead it lands in between the marks at . 5 of every second . i bought this watch for the purpose of taking the pulse of my patients . i can ' t be bothered with trying to figure out if it was 59 . 5 seconds or 60 . 5 seconds when i started counting and then figure out if it ' s 14 . 5 or 15 . 5 seconds later . i am truly upset it doesn ' t live up to the citizen reputation . the issues with the second hand are indicative of low quality control involved with mass - production . ( see below ) other than the faulty second hand , the dial is clearly visible , and glow quite effectively in dark . ( updated review to remove comment about day / date changing at 3pm due to setting it 12hrs off . ) this watch is smaller in diameter than i am accustomed to wearing and is suitable for a female . i will be returning this watch and will not purchase another citizen watch due to the fact i need a watch that correctly aligns with the marks on the dial . i would not recommend this watch to anyone who cares about precision . please reply if you know of a good watch for me to buy for around $ 100 . thanks . citizen replied to my inquiry within moments ! here is their response / excuse : " what you are seeing may be considered within factory specifications . this is due to gear play , dial imprinting and position of the watch . the actual specification is for the hands to hit dead on at 12 : 00 , but other alignment may be to one side or the other of the indice . there are a variety of factors that come into consideration when comparing hand to dial marker accuracy . while position of the watch has some affect on this , manufacturing tolerances in the various components play a greater role . there are acceptable tolerances within the gear mesh , dial imprinting / application , dial ring imprinting ( and mounting position ) as well as tolerances within the dial fitting to the movement itself . when all of these come into play , these tolerances can sometimes compliment each other and other times work against each other . it is for these reasons that there are some pieces within a series that are dead on , some that hit most marks , some that hit half the marks , some that hit some of the marks , etc . it is only when you get to the very high end of the product line ( aka campanola and exceed ) that the acceptable tolerances become " tighter " so to speak . " 
this watch is one of my favorites , along with the steel luminox divers watch . i have used it on many dives and no problems . my first one lasted over 10 years . perfect timekeeping and never a worry about batteries ! 
i own 6 diver watches on rubber straps including a new doxa sub 1200t . this citizen cost a fraction of what i have spent on my other dive watches . however this is the one i get the most satisfaction out of wearing . the one piece case is unique to any others that i own and it is really a work of art . the stainless is nicely finished and the edges are all rounded over and polished . i have about 6 eco drives and have never had any issue with any of them . they just keep running , and it is nice to know that most likely you will never have to open up this watch for service . i don ' t dive and i really like the medium size of the watch . some say it is too small , and it may be if you use it for diving . it is a great size for my taste however . . i don ' t care much for the huge watches that are popular now . maybe if you are ordering online try to see one in person first to see if the size is an issue for you . i just love wearing this even if my seikos are a little larger . oh , and that doxa , it is very similar in size to this citizen ! ! 
the citizen bn0000 - 04h diver arrived yesterday , and it has really exceeded my high expectations . here is a brief review : - looks : the watch simply looks awesome . pictures i ' ve seen online don ' t always do it justice , it is really beautiful . - size : yes , the watch is smaller than most divers , but for my 6 . 5 " wrists , it ' s perfect . if your wrists are larger , you ' ll only like it if you prefer a mid - size watch . - quality / finish : i can ' t believe i paid only $ 165 for this , it has the quality of watches that are much more expensive . the second - hand and the bezel line up perfectly , the bezel clicks nicely , overall finish is outstanding . i love this : when you ' re setting the time , pushing in the crown does not cause the minute hand to jump . this watch is just flawless . - band : reviewers hate it . i don ' t think it ' s that bad , but i am a fan of nato and zulu straps , so i put it on a 20mm nato right away and that ' s the way to go . - crown : reviewers point out that it ' s tough to use the crown due to the guards . yes , it ' s a little tougher than with my other diver , but it ' s not a big deal at all . ideally , i ' d say this watch ought to have a bigger crown displaced at the 4 : 00 position , but the current configuration works fine and it does look good . - lume : very bright when the lights go out , still legible after 7 hours ! - legibility : the minute indices on the chapter ring , coupled with long indices on the bezel , make it very easy to tell time and elapsed time accurately at a glance . - date window : small , as mentioned by others , but no problem for me personally . i really wish this watch had a day / date function , but just date is ok . - durability : this watch gets 5 - stars for toughness . i dropped it on a paved road and it survived the impact without missing a beat ! overall , i am really , really impressed . this watch is beautiful , functional , accurate , and it exudes quality . i love it . 
i bought this watch in 1997 and in 2006 i gave it to a diver friend and he still have it , no battery change , no service , nothing , is still as accurate as ever . i hear that after 20 years the battery still retain more than 80 percent of the charge and they last 25 years , this is really the way to go . forget about automatics , only collectors buy that or kinetics or whatever , eco drive are the best in diving watches or any watches , even seiko is finally making solar models now , and by the way they are extremely accurate . now i have another citizen eco drive promaster , whatever you choose they are all great . 
although the amazon price was higher than one listing on ebay , i bought mine here because of amazon ' s robust return policy . . i need a & # 34 ; stopwatch & # 34 ; function , actually an elapsed time indicator , for pre - dawn runs in town and backcountry skiing , and i also need to see the time of day - - both indications at a glance in all conditions of illumination . subdials and tiny digital screens are often too small to see quickly and clearly . with a watch under several layers of clothing , finding and using g - shock buttons with ice encrusted mittens is not practical . the bn000 - 04h bezel is accurate enough for my purposes . for times longer than an hour , i can remember when i began timing . the stiff , positive bezel is reassuring , and its figures are easily distinguished from the time of day markings . the watch is small , plain and delightfully uncluttered . the writing on the band was quickly removed with acetone . my three other eco - drives have been tough and reliable , so i am pretty confident about this one . 
3 stars for having eco - drive ! i feel like this is one of the few instances where the picture looks better than the real product . although not very pricey in the first place , this watch has a cheaper look than any of my other citizen / seiko watches around this class . one nice point however , is that i like how small it is compared to my other diver watches . it goes against part of what makes a lot of diver watches divers , but it ' s nice to have something a little smaller and lighter on your wrist in the ocean every now and then . 
this watch , very simple , just time , the mobil crown for help timing , and the day display , is more than enough if you are looking for a watch of a good size , accurate , no battery changes ( excellent , so the pressure inside is optimal ) . i have used in two different continents and , besides change the time ( of course , it was not going to do it automatically ) , the watch is excellent . i have used with casual and formal clothes and it is look very good ( sporty of course ) . and overall , excellent watch for a good price . if you are looking for a sport , dive watch , and casual wear , don ' t look other way , this is what you are looking for . 
purpose : this will be my go - to designated wet watch for the twenty times a year i swim and / or snorkel . i need a watch that is better than nominally waterproof and will be ticking when i want to wear it . the 300m depth water resistance rating and the eco - drive meet those needs . the watch : this is a very modest - size watch by dive standards and by today ' s generic standards for sport watches . the 43mm case diameter listed with the specs includes the crown and its surround . additionally the bezel is quite large , which makes for a relatively small dial . the dial , including the seconds dial , is 27mm wide . the dial , excluding the seconds dial , is 23mm wide . for reference , a u . s . quarter is 23 . 5mm wide . all measurements are with a metric ruler rather than with a micrometer and , as such , are approximate . the point is that this is a relatively small dive watch . the circular and triangular hour indicators and the hands are large and legible . the lume is on a par with other non - tritium watches . the second hand and the second hand dial are exactly aligned . although small , the crown is well - protected and works precisely . the 60 - stop rotating bezel is perfectly aligned and works smoothly . as others have mentioned , the numbers are painted on the bezel . the band : i have several models of citizen eco - drives and this is the best band of all , taking into consideration an apples - to - apples comparison as to types of watches . the band compares favorably with any of my dive or sport watches with rubber straps , regardless of the brand . both of the strap - end loop retainers slide rather than having the one closest to the buckle fixed to the strap . in conclusion : having checked the specs closely before i ordered , this watch was exactly what i expected . as well as being soggy - sport - enabled , this watch also would be a good everyday wear for persons needing " beaters " in tough work environments . also , this watch can be found at 50 % + discounts . regards , - - ronupdate 02 - 25 - 2011 : i put an eichmueller solid link , stainless steel bracelet on this watch . rather than for diving , per se , my aqua antics primarily are saltwater swimming , snorkeling , and freshwater pool activities . divers might eschew a bracelet , preferring a rubber strap , but for my purposes the bracelet is perfect . it ' s comfortable to wear and it looks great ! - - ron 
i had a pricey diver ripped off my arm walking down the streets of manila on a previous trip . this watch fits the bill . if you surf , windsurf or dive i recommend this watch . accurate to the extreme . 3 months and has not lost a sec . luminous dots are highly visible at night . you can wear this to bed and it still glows at 00 : 00 dark 00 : 30 in the morning . simple , inexpensive , waterproof and rugged . the crown looks screwed down , it ' s so tiny that unconsciously it appears screwed down when it ' s not . i dove with it unscrewed ( 40 ' ) . the watch survived . the only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is subjective . i suppose it ' s the aesthetics , the face is smallish . but good things come in small packages . the price actually went up on this . it was $ 120 . must no longer be made . 
i bought my husband this watch to replace his less expensive but similar looking invicta pro diver ( which stopped working one day after my husband accidentally hit the watch against the wall and the spring inside it got messed up ; the watch repair shop guy was amazed because the invicta watches rarely break ) . my husband is extremely tough on watches ! ! he hasn ' t taken the citizen watch off for over a year . it looks good and he hasn ' t broken it yet . the band did have the numbers rub off , the crystal has some minor scratches , and the plastic watch keeper pieces both broke off . we ' re replacing the band with a zulu style one because the replacement bands for this particular watch are around $ 50 ( thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 stars ) . this watch will hold up even with hard use . best option for the price ! 
i overlooked this watch 2 - 3 times because the amazon stock photo just doesn ' t do it justice . if you haven ' t you should look on google for more pictures as it looks much better and especially in person , it ' s not near as dull as it looks and you don ' t notice the solar panels . to me the rubber strap also takes away from it and i already had a canvas nato strap lined up for it along with a black leather one . 20mm is the correct size for watch straps just fyi . but enough about how it looks , let ' s talk about function . for setting the time this one is as easy as any other . it is a screw down crown so keep that in mind and don ' t get discouraged when you can ' t just pull it out , it does work . it did unscrew itself once , but i ' ve been wearing it on a fairly tight strap and haven ' t had that problem since . i may not have had it down all the way . the 60 click bezel clicks strong and flawlessly , but is a bit loud . the bold indention ' s make it easy to grip in any conditions . the pins it came with are thick and strong and are easy to change while keeping the strap on the watch in tough conditions . the lume is amazing . it only got about 45 mins of day light and even after dark i was only in artificial light for two hours . when i went to bed it was still so bright i could see some of the second tick marks . after sleeping six hours in a dark room with only a small bit of street light coming in and my hand under the covers i could still tell exactly what time it was . you do want to fully charge it before wearing it as i tried to wear mine right out of the box thinking if i wore it about a week it would charge itself , but i was wrong . after about two weeks it stopped , which really isn ' t bad considering it was probably in it ' s box and had almost zero battery although it did scare the ( ynw ) out of me as even after charging under a lamp overnight it wasn ' t going . however i just had to pull out the crown and push it back in to & # 34 ; reset & # 34 ; it after it stopped . i left it under a fluorescent light at work over the weekend after having it under a lamp at my house and setting it in the sun for a day or so and so far so good , but will update if that changes . overall the only complaint i have is that the second hand is slightly off between the 15 and 45 second marks , which is something you expect from a timex , but not a citizen . i realize it ' s not high end , but am still pretty disappointed in this and it ' s the only reason i didn ' t give 5 stars . 
i like the citizen eco - drive models - they are basically maintenance free . this eco - drive is a decent mid - sized model . if you like big dive watches , then i recommend thecitizen men ' s bj8050 diver watch . thiscitizen men ' s bn0000 - 04h eco - drive professional diver black rubber strap watchis a true dive watch with a unidirectional bezel and super bright luminous dial . it even has a convenient no decompression limits ( ndl ) table printed on the high quality rubber watch band . see my photos in customer imageslike all the eco - drive models , this is a ' set it and forget it ' watch . this is great if you are watch collector , or you don ' t use your dive watch every day . you can replace the strap / band with any 20mm strap / band . this watch needs no expensive proprietory replacement band that only the manufacturer stocks . great ! cons : the numbers are painted on the bezel - so , they would eventually wear ( etched on numbers would have been better ) . the date window is tiny but still readable . the small recessed screw down crown is a bit cumbersome to manipulate . in all fairness , you only need to unscrew the crown to set the date 5 times for the year ( for the 30 day months and feb ) . i gave this watch 4 stars . despite the limitations , i like this watch . it ' s an attractive , quality citizen eco - drive dive watch that is well priced . 
this watch has a simple , beautiful , luminous dial . my husband used it for work until a patient in his er broke the watch . it was a nice , basic watch without a congested face . 
bought from amazon 4 / 8 / 08 : reviewed 5 / 19 / 09 : great watch . works great . accurate time . used it when swimming and not a drop of moisture ever gets in . just make sure the crown is screwed down tight before you go into the water . the moderate size of the watch is really nice . it can be worn for dress or sports . my wife has the smaller womens version and she loves it also . i hope this watch or an upgraded version is around when this one wears out . update 8 / 18 / 09 - watch still working great . went on vacation to many different hotels and swam with watch for hours . still no moisture has been seen under crystal . great watch which keeps accurate time within 1 minute per year . update 10 / 8 / 09 - my watch and my wife ' s watch continues to be accurate and waterproof . great watch and looks great too ! update 2 / 8 / 10 - the watches are still working fine . still no problems with water getting in while swimming . just a pleasure to have . update 4 / 20 / 10 - still working great after 2 years of owning it . hope it is still around when i need another one . watch is same price now as when i first bought it @ 165 dollars . update 8 / 20 / 10 - still working great . went on vacation and watch continues to keep water / moisture out 100 % ! even went into a hot whirlpool and exposed it to the water jets for a couple of minutes and no moisture was seen under the glass ! amazon reduced price to $ 145 , what a steal , i may buy another just in case the one i have breaks down in the future ! ! ! update 11 / 22 / 10 - still working great . still no moisture has gotten under the crystal . time stays accurate within a minute per year . my wife has a ladies version that is also working fine . happy thanksgiving to all ! ! ! update : 2 / 21 / 11 - still working great . no problems at all . fantastic watch . my wife also loves hers . this solar powered waterproof watch is all the watch you will ever need . it will soon be 3 years since the date i bought it , on 4 / 8 / 08 , and i am sure happy i did ! ! ! update : 3 / 9 / 11 - bought one for a birthday present for a relative and he just loves it . sent it to him gift rapped - 1 day mail . he called me and told me it was just a beautiful watch . this watch is really a hit everywhere i go . i hope they keep making it . the one piece solid steel case back is unique and being solar powered makes it a rare watch indeed . it is the most comfortable watch i have worn . the photo on amazon does not do it justice . it is really a handsome watch . citizen eco - drive 300 meter is a far better value than any divers watch out there . i should know , i just bought the new rolex deep sea . it is one impressive piece of watch . it is the only watch in existence that can withstand a water pressure depth down to a tested 16 , 000 feet . the crystal is virtually unbreakable . the $ 9800 sticker price is ridiculous and i was able to get the authorized dealer to sell it to me for $ 8800 including tax . just a great price for this type of collectable iconic watch . but the citizen eco 300 meter , price for performance , with same basic look but much thinner and lighter is a far better deal for the average watch wearer who wants a high quality diver watch for a very reasonable price . update : 5 / 1 / 11 - watch still working great . no problems at all . just a great quartz watch . my wife ' s women ' s eco 300 is also working fine . update : 1 / 2 / 2012 - happy new year ! my eco - drive diver ' s watch is still working great and so is the one my wife has . price still the same as when i bought it on 4 / 8 / 08 . it is just a great watch and i have not had any problems with it nor has my wife . i have bought two more of these watches as presents for relatives and they just love these watches . the solar driven mechanism and 300 meter diving ability make these watches unique ! may you all have a healthy & happy year ! update : 7 / 25 / 2012 - hello everybody . my watch is still working great and so is my wife ' s . what a winner is this watch . see you after the summer . update : 5 / 21 / 2013 - watch finally stopped working . no known reason . just does not charge up anymore . got over 5 years of use . never had a problem . bought another one . these watches run on a solar battery and you just cannot change it . it is out of warranty so i just bought another one . hope i can get another 5 years at least ! 
there is no question that when it comes to clever watches that are made for everyone , citizen knows to make great watches , for the man on the go , or the man who loves to play with the sports of life . that comes well with each and every eco - drive watch that they honestly make , and this one is absolutely no acception . this eco - drive diver watch is absolutely a great buy for the every man with a simple everyday watch in life . it not only works great and is very easy to set up . it also handles well , with the brightest illument hands and accents on the watch that shine absolutely well . so you can read the time easily for any time and any way you use it . whether it is watching a flick at your local movie theater , or talking a walk in the moonlight with your significant other , this watch is a absolute delight to own . if you are looking for a great watch , trust me when i say that you should consider trying a citizen eco - drive , and this is one worth trying . price : b + comfort : bsetup : b 1 / 2 + overall : b 1 / 2 + 
i have owned this watch for five years , and it is still running and very accurate . solar powered watches are great . it charges up easily by sunlight or even putting it under a lamp overnight . i have done several dives with the watch and it performed as expected . it is not my main dive watch , i use a casio g shock most of the time , but if you prefer an analog with a one way ratcheted bezel this the way to go . my only criticisms , and they are minor , are that the date is way to small to read , they should have just not had a date and it would be better with a more anti reflection in the crystal , also it is on the small side , around 40mm without the crown , as larger faces are the style now . this is a tough watch and i highly recommend it ! for more information and discussion of citizen divers go to watch freaks forum : [ . . . ] there is special board dedicated to citizen watches . 
this was a big disappointment . the crown was so small that it was very difficult to set the time . the back of the watch was not flat and it did not sit properly on the wrist . i returned it and replaced it with the seiko solar dive watch , which i love . 
i like this watch a lot . is 300 meters water ressistant and never needs batteries . to be sure is full charged i puy it in front a window once a month . fine ! 
i am very happy with my recent purchase of the citizen men ' s bm8242 - 08e ' eco - drive ' gold - tone stainless steel and leather watch . the styling is great for dress or casual wear . 
this was a birthday gift for my son who had it on his amazon wish list . he is delighted with the watch . when his friends saw him unwrap it at the party , they exclaimed with enthusiasm which means it must be a perfect gift for the age 35 year old group . 
watch looks great . it ' s small which is what i was going for . looks classy and traditional . goes very well with anything from casual wear to suits . i ' m very satisfied . after wearing constantly for a few months , the watch shows no signs of wear and tear . leather band is in great shape and the face looks new . 
first off , i ' m a young female in her mid 20 ' s looking for a decent and formal yet casual looking watch , and citizen ' s women ' s watch just won ' t do , since most of them seems to be too thin and flimsy for me . friend recommended this after browsing on the internet , and though i ' m reluctant at first considering it ' s a & # 34 ; men ' s watch & # 34 ; , i ' m happy that i took her advice and bought it . i dress in formal ( and casual ) black a lot , and the color matches perfectly whatever i wear , suit or dress . burgundy strap with the black and gold surface is simply amazing . i ' ve been receiving compliments from many the first day i wear it , and they never realize it ' s actually a men ' s watch . only thing is the size ; it still comes off as a bit loose on my wrist , but it ' s do - able . it ' s meant to be a men ' s watch , after all , so no complaints from a woman . for a guy , they might have some size issues of the strap being too short however . for the function , a few minutes out of the box and it ' s moving . didn ' t even have to read the manual to set the correct time , and the date and day of the week is extremely convenient . easy to read and beautiful . the price on amazon tends to fluctuate , and at $ 105 with shipping , it ' s a steal . 
too small and hard to read for me and the crown is small and hard to set . i do not recommend , would not buy again and i hope this helps . 
great looking dress watch . the citizen eco drive is amazing , i love never having to replace the battery . if i haven ' t worn it for a while it will die , but soon as i pick it up it starts moving again . 
i bought the white face but will also buy a black face watch for evening wear . i have a expensive rolex , i like this so much more . 
i purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it . nothing to complain about this . worth the price ! 
well i looked at this watch for a long time before purchasing . at the same time i also bought the version with the black band . these are great though the band leaves a lot to be desired . i know that can be disheartening to some but i still would go with this watch over other options . 
when it has came down to citizen , they definitely have made some excellent watches , time and time again . but nevertheless , there are some pieces that they have made that could have had a bit more to match . this citizen eco - drive piece is alright . but it does display a mixture of both accents and numerals 4 , 8 , and 12 on the piece . it is alright but honestly it could have had a bit more in its features . it snugs very comfortably around the wrist and is easy to setup on the time . yet , i did though wish there could have been a little more in its features including illuminated hands that glow in the dark , and a bit more in the feature of the face . still , you do get a quality watch from citizen eco - drive , but more could have been added here in this solar timepiece . price : c + comfort & setup : c + overall : c + 
keeps good time , doesn ' t turn my arm green either . well worth the money . the bad is a little stiff initially . 
a very attractive watch and i just love the thought of never having to ever buy another battery . the instructions say when fully charged you can put it in the dark for up to six months without it losing its charge . we ' ll see how it stands the test of time . 
first , let me say i ' m brand new to the whole world of horology . but , i have had enough watches to know which brands are like the ferraris and which are yugos . citizen is like a toyota . you know it ' s going to last and it ' s not going to give you a lot of trouble . but my philosophy when it comes to my possesions is that it doesn ' t matter if it ' s a $ 260 , 000 . 00 henry winston or something that came with an oil change ( yes i actually have a seahawks watch that came free with an oil change ) your watch is going to last if you take care of it . so having said all that i will say that this watch is a good buy . it ' s inexpensive , not cheap , there is a difference . for those of us down here closer to the bottom you learn that there is a difference between the two for your money . no , it ' s not an omega , a tag heuer , or a rolex , but a good buy . the band appears to be nicely made . i love the embossed " crocodile " pattern . it ' s a light watch compared to most . the accuracy is pretty much right on the money . i was surprised how many reviewers say the wear it all the time . the crystal is only mineral and not sapphire and the band is leather so it ' s probably not something you want to wear in the shower or while digging around the garden . if you want a watch for a more ' active ' lifestyle your $ 125 would be much better served with a sporty citizen or casio g - shock which are also good watches for the money . so , if you ' re looking for a watch thats going to last for not a lot of money you can ' t go wrong . 
i had this mailed to my brother . it didn ' t take long for him to figure out who sent it . he wanted to know when the rolex is coming . i would rather spend my money on a new corvette . the watch is eye catching and resembles my timex . 
we bought this watch for a college graduate and he was impressed . first of all , the watch looks really good . it ' s definitely a watch for a graduate ' s first job or a night out to a nice restaurant . the watch is powered by the sun . our graduate appreciated that fact , as he will generally not spend $ 15 to get a new battery . he has a numberof watches with dead batteries . the only minor ( very minor ) complaint would be the band , that is brown but it ' s just a little over the top in terms of it ' s striped look . i have this same band onanother watch and it gets worn looking after a few months . hopefully our graduate will replace the band when it ' s worn , rather than replace the watch . all in all , this is a great gift or even a purchase for yourself . my understanding is the battery in these watches are good for 20 + years , but by then who knows if anyone will be wearing watches any more . this is a great gift . you could pay a lot more and not get a better , more practical watch than this . 
i gave this watch a 2 after owning it for almost 2 years . the watch out of the box worked great for about 6 - 7 months then stopped running . i have always been careful to be sure the watch was in plenty of light to stay running . the watch has been in water but no deeper than 20 ft . if i hold the watch directly under a lamp the second hand will move but as soon as i remove from the direct light it stops . the watch is under warranty but when reading the warranty instructions i tried to contact one of the locations listed only to find out that it no longer serviced citzen watches . i did find one location that would service but i had to pay shipping both ways and might have incurred a charge for any work not covered by the warranty . additionally if the watch was unrepairable they would not send a replacement watch . it is a shame because i really like the watch but currently it is just sitting on my desk until i find a way to inexpensively get it repaired . 
i bought a used one of these really cheap at a pawnshop . the rubber strap was broken in half and the shop owner just wanted to get rid of it i guess . the watch itself was near perfect with no scratches on the crystal and the case only had very minor scuffing . . contrary to and earlier review here , you can change the band very easily yourself . . it is just held in place with machine screws on the back of the case . . i believe i purchased the band here on amazon . . it wasn ' t cheap but now i have one of these big , beautiful watches that looks new ! ! 
i ordered the citizen diving watch and received it within 2 working days . the watch looked exactly like the photo and came packaged in a nice leather bound zippered case . the watch is a little heavier than a normal watch but that is due to the construction needed for diving . i am not a scuba diver but i look cool as hell with the watch on ! it keeps great time and since it ' s an eco drive watch , it never needs batteries just sunlight . i am very happy for my purchase ! 
i ' ve had this watch for a couple of days now . it arrived running and set to the correct time and date . it ' s a large watch and the face is very clear and easy to read . in spite of the size and weight it is one of the most comfortable watches i have ever worn . it is certainly the most comfortable big watch that i have ever worn . it seems very well balanced on the wrist and feels like a much smaller watch . the luminous markings are excellent and easy to see . i love this watch and have been wearing it to work . really you can ' t go wrong if you like large , diver watches . 
being a citizen eco - drive , this watch is well made and slick as expected . i really like the eco drive line of watches . the detail on the dial as well as the external detail is very nice for the price range . this model is obviously a serious diver design and it is actually made for diving use . it is a fun watch to wear every day if you choose to but i will warn this is a very heavy watch . because of the weight of the case and the fact that it sits very high off of the wrist causes the watch to shift . you will know you are wearing this watch all day without a doubt . i use this as my fishing watch . if i every get it wet i do not care , it is tough and built for activity ! with the crown on the left side it is not prone to catch on things but with the thickness of the case it will still be very capable of hitting objects if you are not careful . the crystal is well protected as the bezel rises above the crystal surface and this will help prevent scratches . i have a small wrist so this one is pretty animated when i move around but i love it . this spring i plan on catching a lot of fish with this in tow . great diver from citizen . 
muito boa compra . recomendo a quem queira comprar este produro , pois alem de ter um excelente peo . & eacute ; um artigo de 1 
despite being affectionately known by it ' s owners as ' the tuna can ' , this watch is awesome - - easy to read dial , the dial glows quite brightly in the dark , the crystal has a magnifier effect to make dial readings even easier , the weight is substantial but not overbearing , and the size is also substantial but classy in design . the watch keeps great time , has a screw - down crown for water tightness , and has a uni - rotating bezel as any proper diving watch should . i am not a fan of resin bands , so after doing a little homework i stumbled upon this site - - do a search for suppa parts - - the url got removed by amazon . they make and sell watch - case attachments for using normal 24 mm watch bands with this model , as well as some nicely made leather bands . their stuff isn ' t cheap , but it is very nicely made . i purchased a dark brown leather band for mine , and i have to say the look is killer . of course i will need to change the band back to the resin one prior to taking it in the water , but i ' ll deal with it . the eco - drive works very well - - i had the watch stored in a watch case for 3 months at one point , and it held a charge with no problems . in fact , it may have been able to charge itself off of room light to some degree since my watch case has a glass top . the watch is masculine , but understated in it ' s styling , which is what i like . it appears to be extremely well made , and should last a long time of real - world use . i also own some high - quality watches ( heuer , omega , longenes ) , so i feel qualified to make this statement . go ahead - - treat yourself . highly recommended . 
i wear this watch everyday , for everything . i have to say up front i didn ' t buy this on amazon , but i wanted to give it a review here anyway , as i like it so much . i was given this watch as a christmas gift a few years ago by my wife and as i ' m a retired marine , she bought it at the px . so it was a little less expensive than you see here ( $ 250 vs . $ 276 ) . in any case , imo it ' s well worth the money . in fact i think it ' s worth much more . this watch is heavy , big , thick , simple and has no stopwatch , no alarm , no nothing special really . but it does one thing really , really well . it keeps great time in any conditions . i have worn this diving , during adventure races , fishing , hiking , rock climbing , hunting , doing military pt , including running " o " courses . it has never failed me . it looks great in any attire , people ask me about it all the time . i rarely take it off and hope to have it for the next 20 + years . 
there is no question that citizen has really made some excellent watches to take on the go for anywhere you desire . i was very impressed with this particular watch . this professional diver citizen eco - drive watch handles very well , and fits snugly on the comfort the wrist . i like the illumient hands and the features on the face of the watch . when it glows in the dark , it works absolutely brilliantly . the uni - directional bezel also handles well as you can simply turn it in the blink of a eye . my one of only gripe about the watch is the crown being a screw - down crown . it can be very difficult to take out , and can get stuck at times . still , if you want to take a watch for any purpose , in the water while diving , or something completely different to wear , than this citizen eco - drive would be for you . price : c + comfort & setup : b + overall : b 1 / 2 - 
i am a fan of the eco - drive solar - powered citizen line of watches after my brother got me one for the holidays a year ago . the one he got me , the calibre 8700 , has 3 chronometer displays and is only about 35 mm bezel ( watch face ) width . it is also difficult to set as each of the 3 chronometers has its own directions so i am constantly consulting the manual . in contrast , the professional diver watch has a huge masculine bezel face , almost 50 mm . a very bold and masculine look , especially with the black rubber strap , as opposed to the shiny metal bling that i personally find distasteful in a men ' s watch . even more importantly , the diver watch has no chronometer displays and this makes changing the time and date easy to use . you pull out the crown to the second click to set the time ; to the first click to set the date . that ' s it . so easy to use and so bold to look at . i only have one criticism : the rubber strap is big and lacks flexibility so you have to sit the watch in its case or else it will fall over and get scratched . also the strap is so rigid that it is very difficult to remove it from your wrist . but on balance this is my favorite looking watch , especially for the price , around 185 - 225 on amazon , depending on the sales , and for any man looking for a bold and masculine look over the " pretty " the professional diver is a great choice . update : i still love my citizen diver ' s watch and have found another bold , masculine automatic watch that requires no battery : the invicta corduva 3448 , which i purchased for 171 dollars , about 30 dollars less than i spent on my citizen . with a 52 millimeter bezel , its face is even bigger and bolder than the citizen ' s . 
very very small watch , not close to worth the money they charge for the watch . i returned the watch . thank you . 
fun watch . gets a lot of attention . love solar power watches , will last 6 months on full charge . water resistantto 300 meters and built tough . would recommend to anyone ! 
as noted by others this is a large and thick watch . unfortunately imo the version with the stainless steel bracelet is no longer available that i can find . this version of the watch uses a unique strap attachment arrangement so that only the rubber strap can be used as received . fortunately there is a source for adapters that allow use of normal 24mm wide watch straps and bands . the adapters are called " suppa " adapters and if you want a set then google for their web site . for the customer who complained of the calendar arrangement , his complaint is true of probably 95 % + of current watches which use a date wheel and window . most however use a three position stem which when pulled out to the first not fully seated position allows resetting the calendar without disturbing the time setting . there are date window watches with a so called perpetual calendar , usually good to 2100 , but that feature is going to limit your selection severely and up the price paid . unless " perpetual calendar " is specifically noted as a feature of a given watch then the arrangement used by this citizen watch is almost certain to be used . the popular web name for this watch is the " ecozilla " , short for eco - drive godzilla . i presume this is in reference to it being big enough for godzilla to wear ! it is a large and heavy watch but with current watch style trends it is not the largest or heaviest . not for the skinny wristed however . 
i will say that it took me several months to work up the courage to purchase this watch . i hesitated because it looked too bulky . in reality it is bulky but that is what i was looking for in this particular watch . surprisingly , it wasn ' t as bulky as i thought it would be . i purshased the watch to wear during the warm months with short sleeve shirts . it is an eye catcher but i don ' t care about that really . i own 4 citizen eco - drives and love the brand . this watch is built like a tank and i love the simplicity . time and date is all you ' re getting from this monster and that is just fine with me . i wear my more expensive and overly complicated eco - drive watches when i need more than just time and date . if you like quality along with size , this is the watch for you . if you plan on wearing it with dress shirts , you may want to go in another direction because most cuffs will not fit over this monster . all in all another great product and value from citizen . 
yeah it ' s a little big , but it fits great . i haven ' t taken it off since it arrived . after the first day or two you don ' t even realize you have it on . the strap is different , but it keeps the watch secure and doesn ' t allow it to flip around on your wrist . it ' s super accurate ( so far ) and the second hand lines up with the markers . . . which is very important on a quartz watch . this one is definitely a keeper ! update : i ' ve been wearing this watch almost 24 - 7 since the day i got it . last night i took it off and noticed that the metal band keeper , was wearing a hole in my wrist . looks like i ' m going to have to find a different band for it : ( update ii : i was wearing the watch 24 - 7 . . or , i was wearing it while sleeping . i stopped doing that , and the metal keeper stopped wearing a hole in my wrist . . . fair trade if you ask me ! lol . : ) 
i love this watch . has been accurate and working fine since i got it . be aware though that this is quite a large , heavy watch . i measured and it is almost 3 / 4 inches thick with a very large face . it took some getting used to . it seemed too heavy on my wrist at first , but i am used to it now and it is quite comfortable . the band cannot be changed without a special adapter . not a big deal to me . this is an awesome watch and definitely grabs attention . the crystal is protected as the outer ring is higher . this is one great watch for the money . the eco drive is awesome . i love this watch . it is a tank and seems indestructible . 
first of all i am not a diver , so i cannot comment on the diving capabilities of this watch . i got this because i got a macy ' s gift card . this was the best looking watch in my price range . that ' s why i picked it up . it is quite heavy and chunky and looks and feels very durable . i wore it for a day and i definitely notice it being on . due to the thickness of it i accidentally banged it a couple of times against my kitchen counter . while i had it on at work i got some stares but no compliments or negative remarks . i guess that ' s a good and bad sign . : ) in my humble opinion this watch is not meant as an everyday watch . it is very good looking and looks quite bulletproof but not very practical to wear on a day to day basis . after two days of wearing it i switched back to my other watch . despite the size and weight i still think it ' s a great watch i would recommend it to anyone . 
if looking for an inexpensive but really quite cute halloween costume , this is a good choice . i ' m normally a small and the medium fit me perfectly , so i would say size up , for sure . 
fit very well . not uncomfortably short . runs a just a little smaller than sizing chart indicates . cute and worked for a murder mystery party 
well put together costume , was suprised of its weight . . i love it ! if you are big busted go up a size though 
if buying this strictly for an inexpensive costume option , then this dress is worth it . the sizing runs a bit small ( as other reviewers mentioned ) so order up a size ( or two ) if you want to be comfortable . also , please note the fringe is a bit fragile so you can expect to lose a string or two in the course of the evening . otherwise it was just right for a flapper costume on a budget . 
the dress itself is decent , especially for the price . if it had fit i definitely would have been very pleased . unfortunately the sizing is ridiculously off . i normally wear a 4 - 6 and ordered the medium ( 8 - 10 ) since most reviews warned that it runs small . i figured even if it were loose that ' d be fine bc that kind of goes with the flapper style anyway . i could barely get it past my chest and the hips were not gonna happen . honestly , i ' m not that curvy so this was a shock . sadly , i had to return . i wish they had more accurate sizing bc now i ' m too hesitant to buy any of the california costumes items . 
i love this dress ! it ' s so much fun ! the quality is excellent . it ' s a perfect fit . as always amazon carries the best merchandise ! ! 
my daughter needed this for a sorority event ( lord knows ) . she sent me the link to order for her , at least she said please this time , before i ordered i read the reviews and noticed many saying the dress was tight through the hips . i called her and mentioned that to her , and asked that she review her size , of course that was an insult . anyway , when i did not hear back i ordered her original request size . the pico - second i hit the buy button the phone rang and she said ok , get the bigger size . amazon was great about cancelling the first order . just got an email yesterday , & # 34 ; the dress arrived , thank you . it is huge . i think i can use safety pins to fix it . i know i should have gotten the smaller size . & # 34 ; talk about a poke in the eye , when i bought her the damn dress ! so , it sometimes sucks to be the dad and i am not sure this dress is as small as some think ! 
loved this dress for our prohibition party . got a lot of compliments on how cute it was . it is of costume - quality so by the end of the night the red fringe were falling out , but i would highly recommend this for a costume party . 
cheap and small ! ! and they didn ' t let me return it . no , thanks 
this is perfect for our flapper corporate event , it looks great on and is not too short . i definitely recommend buying the long gloves to complete the look ! 
this dress makes you want to dance and shimmy ! it is so much fun . as some other reviewers said , it is tight around the hips and butt , so keep that in mind when ordering . it is such a flattering dress you ' ll want to wear it for more than just halloween ! 
i usually wear size large . . i ' m 5 ' 9 150lb . i got xl and it fits perfect , super cute . . i love it . the strings do come loose but i ' m only wearing it once . the price was right and delivery was quick 
documentation is a little lacking but the tool itself is well made and works great . has already paid for itself ! 
not high end but it gets the job done . it is a bit awkward to hold the opener in the proper position but i have opened several watches with it . need to be careful to hold in position or it will slip and scratch the watch back 
i received the tool in perfect condition . looks good and sturdy and a great wooden storage box . however , it does not come with instructions . beware , if you ' re a beginner . 
my watch battery died and there was no way i was getting the back opened on my own . the little watch stand in the mall was going to charge me over $ 20 just go take the back off and change the battery . i decided instead just to purchase this tool and a watch battery myself and how i can change the watch battery myself . the tool comes in a little wooden box with multiple different attachments to adjust to opening different types of watches . i would recommend getting some sort of a watch holder to keep the watch in place when you are using the tool because it can take a little effort but my experience would have been easier if i had something to hold the watch still for me so that the watch itself as well as the little screws in the tool wouldn ' t slip off the watch . . all in all , if you want to be able to open your watch back yourself or change batteries i would say this will do the job . 
i ' ve always considered myself mechanically adept but i had trouble using this tool . the instructions need a great deal of work . my advice to the manufacturer would be to develop a fixed device that i have seen work on jeweler ' s benches . also , to be more effective , the heads should consist of a two - sided static pieces and two sides that can be adjusted . oh , and you will want to fix the base from up and down movement . otherwise , the watch merely squirms away from the wrench , as it does now . i would not buy this wrench again . if this review was helpful , please add your vote . 
ordered this to open my husband ' s sports watch because it had the indents in the back that had to be turned . he followed the directions and opened it easily with no problem . saved taking it to a jeweler to change the battery . would highly recommend for all waterproof watches that have that case that does not pop off with a knife . 
i was paying $ 10 to get my battery changed in my fossil watch every year or two . . i bought a battery for $ 2 bucks and with this tool . . . basically paid for itself . mine did not come with any instructions but was easy to figure out . . and like others said . . just push in the correct bit all the way and it will not fall out . the other bits are odd looking and curious what kind of watch takes them but i only needed the one set for all my watches . . very pleased . not giving 5 stars because there are no instructions and the case is lame . . but still a good buy . 
i have been using this product for over 6 months and i have found it more then adequate for the money spent on it . i am happy to say that because others of the same nature cost more then what i spent on this set . i endorse this tool set with confidence . i added this part after some more thoughts . it is important that when using this that you understand most gaskets last only a few years so order some extras for yourself to have and also the goo / sealant for the threads is a must . with out these other ingredients your watch will not be as water resistant as it was . i hope this helps . . . namaste ' 
i was getting tired of using needle - nose pliers to get the backs off my watches , so this was the perfect product for me . it was mailed quickly and is as described . i would buy from this company again . 
not much to this thing , but it works and that ' s all one can really say . it ' s engineered for watch backs with notches 90 from one another , but you can use just two of the keys to open most other watches . the case is nice since the little , interchangeable bits can get easily lost . 
well built tool , comes with wooden case . tools comes well greased . clean off grease prior to using . comes with 3 sets of 3 prongs to fit in case back indent . adjusts in width and length . some mechanical knowledge and " feel " is required to operate it correctly . useful and does the job well . should be used in conjonction with a watch case holder . 
this is a decent tool and a very low price . it ' s obviously not a high - precision device , but used carefully can get the job done . i stress " carefully " . if the tool is not adjusted to exactly fit your watch ' s cover plate , you ' re almost certainly risking serious scratches on the cover . the unit i received was only " ok " both of the adjustments worked smoothly , but one of the pin sockets did not contain a detent ball , so that pin was loose and wobbly . one of the other detent balls was stuck and i had to move it with a screwdriver before the pin could be fully inserted . i put a couple of layers of transparent tape on the pin base and that cured the " loose pin " problem . however , the wood case is very nice . : - ) 
works well on watches with notched screw on backs but i could not get it to remove the serrated edge back ( similar to rolex type back ) on an older victorinox quartz pocket watch . 
i collect watches and got tired of bringing them to the jewelers to have the batteries changed when they died . now i change the batteries myself and save big bucks . the jewelers charge me $ 10 - 15 bucks , now i change them myself for $ 2 bucks . . . . : ) 
mine came with no instructions , but the expanding / contracting triangular configuration of the wrench mechanism seems intuitive enough . the problem is , i have yet to experience any success in prying loose the back of a dead watch for replacement of the battery . i haven ' t put more than 5 - 10 minutes into the project , so i have no doubt , especially based on other consumers ' reports , that i will catch on and succeed eventually . still , why is it so unthinkable to include an instruction sheet with a diagram or two ? and why are watches built to make battery replacement the most user - unfriendly of all projects ? 3 - 4 tiny screws in the back would be preferable to these screw - out covers , which simply offer no surface area for the mechanism to grab on to . 
i was concerned about buying this tool as some reviewers said the quality was poor , but for an amateur ( which i am ) this device seems very well made . the machining appears to be solid , the parts have held up and don ' t appear to be inferior metal / hardness . the device arrived thoroughly oiled . and as someone with reasonable mechanical aptitude but no experience with watches , i found it dead simple to set this device up to open several watches that i have had laying around waiting for batteries . adjusting the device to fit each watch back was easy . you have to be careful , as other reviewers have pointed out , not to scratch the back of the watch , and also not to accidentally poke yourself in the hand if the device slips while using it , but that ' s true for many hand tools , so caveat user . i ' m totally satisfied with the price and quality of this device . for the price of a single watch battery replacement at a store , i can now " fish for myself " and replace batteries on all my watches that have screw - on back plates . 
i can ' t give it 5 stars , it ' s not perfect . i have a lot of watch tools , and this is a nice one . the case is nice , and it works as it should . but , again , it ' s not perfect . the pins don ' t stay in , making it harder to use ( you have to use it upside down , and the pins don ' t lock in ) . and there should be instructions for those who don ' t know exactly how to use it . the little half - sheet that is included is all but useless . but it ' s a great deal for the price . easily opens the notch - back cases i use it on . 
i bought it to remove the back of my watch . all it did was scratch it up . it won ' t stay in place while you try to apply the necessary force to unscrew . it slips and slides around and you are constantly readjusting it back to the size required . in the end , i gave up and took it to a jeweler who removed it within seconds . it looks nice but it is worthless . 
the pins do fall out when the unit is turned upside down ( the best way to open the case ) . you get what you pay for ( in this case , very little ) . it does work , though , and will pay for itself in only a few battery changes . 
it is a well built and roomy backpack . . comfortable to tote . the bad thing about mine was that it had such a strong chemical smell on it i didnt want to carry it . . . . 
it has held up very well so far , and let me tell you we have had plenty of backpacks that would have been in shreds by now . it is roomy and is made of light weight , but durable material which thankfully decreases the overall weight the kids have to lug around all day . 
it ' s really flimsy , which , of course , you can guess from the price and i thought i wouldn ' t care . but the fact that i ' ve used it only once tells me it wasn ' t a wise purchase . i ride a motor scooter and a bicycle and i prefer white accessories for visibility , but this just doesn ' t make the cut . 
the backpack is a good size and holds quite a bit of things . i am very pleased that i bought it . 
it ' s a nice and basic backpack . well made and comfortable to wear . at the price its more than worth it . 
this is a medium sized ( it ' s listed as large ) backpack that is simple andwithout frills . it is well constructed and has carried my bocce set withoutthe stitching coming apart at all . it was inexpensive and i am more than pleased with this product . 
i was looking for a pretty anklet but didn ' t want to spend a lot . i saw this one and saw it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try . i was not disappointed ! its so sparkly and pretty . it isn ' t chunky which i like because i have little ankles . it is very sturdy and you can ' t beat the price ! great buy ! 
this is a beautiful anklet ! i was pleased with the design and the ease of being able to wear it every day ! i ' ve not taken it off since it arrived and it ' s held up under socks , in the shower , and in bed . and though i haven ' t worn it with hose yet , it doesn ' t seem to snag . it ' s a simple clean and subtle design and if you do leave it on , you will hardly know it ' s there . you will not regret a purchase of this item . 
after the anklet was not available in the size i needed , i decided to go ahead and order 1 / 2 inch shorter . when the anklet finally arrived , the chain already looked tarnished ! there was no shine and it had the yellow / gold tarnished look . i will try to clean when i get time and hopefully clean the anklet up . will have to wait and see how well it ' ll clean up with the silver cleaner . will keep my fingers crossed . 
one of the next best best betst best gifts sturdy not easily broken was a gift and really enjoyed and appreciated ! ! ! ! ! 
im gay and bought this anklet for the summer . its a bit thin than i wanted it to be but im getting used to it . ive had it one for a week , sleeping and bathing in it , its strong and shiny . id recommend if you like thin anklets . the handle was a bit hard to put on though . 
love it so far i ' m not into bulky jewlery so this is perfect for me its not to thick and not to thin looks classy . 
i put this on the day it came and haven ' t taken it off yet ! i like the look . . . simple and sparkles just a little due to the twist in the chain . it was just what i wanted . it looks good with an additional bracelet if wanted as it fits snug to the ankle but not too tight for me . i have trouble with sizes and this one " just fits " . i ' m not sure how long it will last wearing it non - stop but so far so good ! 
this is a very pretty anklet . i purchased the 9 inch and it is a little snug but i think that is par for the size . the next size up seemed like it would be too big for me . the chain is silver , it ' s a little thinner then i thought it would be but not drastically thin , just dainty and feminine . it arrived somewhat fast and well packaged . i would recommend this item and seller . 
i purchased two of these and can ' t wait to wear them when i go to florida . they are very cute , good quality and look great on . order with confidence . 
i just received it yesterday and am very happy with it . it is really delicate and looks nice on too 
i order ankle bracelet 4 years ago from gem avenue and it just brook . i never took it off and silver color never faded away . i wear a size 7 and 9 ' ankle bracelet fits me perfect . after the first one broke 4 years ago i purchase one in store ( different brand ) lasted 3 days . so i came back to amazon to re order same one . item was shipped within 6 days and already using it . i love gem avenue ankle bracelet so much . 
inexpensive , arrived on time and what i wanted . i would suggest measuring your ankle to get the right size , luckily i guessed correctly . 
the anklet has a fantastic fluidity and beautiful shine to it . it looks very fragile and delicate - but on first impression the clasp was solid . girlfriend used to wear a snake chain anklet but fell in love with this instantly . however , she lost it in about a month of wearing - simply fell off somewhere . but this looked so great that she now wouldn ' t wear any other anklet . needless to say , it was worth it - and i ' ll buy another one nonetheless . 
this ankle bracelet is everything they said it would be . . . sturdy , durable & very pretty . i just wish i would have gotten a smaller size but still fits ok . . . i love it ! ! ! 
really gorgeous the design is so beautiful i wear it everyday because its pretty strong too . has a really great shine 
great product to buy , its simple and i have been wearing it ever since i got it to get it used to my ankle . the anklet is really thin and i thought with at least one good tough pull that it would break and fall off . so far it hasnt ( and i tested it with a few accidents myself ) , showing its remarkable sturdiness or whatever its called xs . i also appreciate the fast shipping , a great anklet to buy ! 
i read reviews before i ordered . they said it sparkled , etc . when i saw it i knew they were telling the truth . this is a beautiful little anklet that is sturdy and sparkles and shines ! i love it ! 
this is a really pretty silver figaro necklace . if you like this style , you can ' t go wrong with this necklace . the service was very prompt . 
shopping for mother ' s day is always such a hassle so i decided to try ordering this silver chain on line for my mother - in - law . not only did it arrive quickly , but it came in a nice silver box . very sweet chain for the charm we bought her . used this seller again when i needed another chain recently . 
i ordered the 30 " chain and it ' s beautiful . perfect length ! i ' m actually ordering another today , along with a shorter length . highly recommend this product and seller . shipping was fast and secure . the silver is a beautiful quality . very happy ! 
this was a gift for my boyfriend last christmas , to replace another chain he was using of some random metal that would sometimes color his neck orange ( boys are weird sometimes , i would ' ve thrown it out the first time it happened ) . anywho , he loved this gift and wears it everyday . i love that it doesn ' t make his neck smell funky or turn his skin colors . it also looks really good and is well made . another plus is it ' s made in italy , and he ' s italian so he thought that was cool . highly recommend ! 
i ordered this chain for my husband - it looks very nice and saved me from running to the malls . price was good as well . very satisfied . 
i ' ve worn this chain for three years , nonstop ( i only took it off one time for an x - ray ! ) , and it ' s still in great shape ! so it lasts a long time too ! i really wish i could give it 4 . 5 stars instead of 4 ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is a beautiful chain for a pendant ( or like me , a saint ' s medal ! ) . it has a lovely intricate design that i haven ' t seen before and is quite stunning . the chain is a tad bit shiny , so keep that in mind . i ' ve worn mine solidly for a month now , take showers & sleep in it , and it ' s still holding up , as is my 6 year old daughter ' s chain , who also wears it sleeping , playing , and all that rough stuff that kids do . neither one has shown any signs of weakness and for the price , i highly recommend it . the only flaw i saw was that one or two tiny links were " bunched " up with each other , i was able to fix all but one by simply pulling them and trying to wiggle it . i still haven ' t fixed the last one but i am afraid to break the chain , and since it is minor it ' s staying . i would recommend the chain more for women than men , although if your man isn ' t particularly picky . . . . it seems more feminine to me with the fancy design . i plan on buying more for my other children when i get around to it ! ! 
i had purchased the 24 & # 34 ; , and really liked it , but because of the length , i was catching it , and breaking it . after the 3rd time , i decided to try the 22 & # 34 ; and it is just right . it is very high quality and the design is so different from other chains i have looked at . even though i like a longer chain , this is just right , and i would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a chain that will get compliments . 
this is a very pretty , versatile chain , perfect alone or with a pendant . it ' s a excellent width and weight . i recommend it . 
i love wolves , i may not be making any wolf puns or jokes as the others have but this shirt is really worth it . the picture doesn ' t fade when washed , still looks bold as ever . it ' s made from 100 % cotton and it ' s really comfortable . quick shipping too . 
it was amazing to deal with u the items was perfect and no damages on them but i hope to deliver it early next time 
my son put the shirt on immediately , commenting ' how cool ! ! ' that about says it all ! ! good fit , vivid image , well received ! 
this product and the other two that i bought in conjunction with it were amazingly detailed . the designs on the shirt were full of vivid color painting beautiful pictures . they arrived in the mail earlier than the shipping deadline had predicted too . i will definitely shop from this store again ! 
bought this as a gift for my niece . the picture was exactly as shown , the material was typical t - shirt material , and the size fit just as expected . no complaints . 
the tee shirt is really too long for my husband to wear anywhere . he is tall and has a long torso , but the tee shirt is still too long . 
this is one of the most awesome wolf shirts i ' ve ever seen . i wear a lot of wolf shirts and this is at the top of the list ! ! 
i wear this watch nearly everyday . it holds up well . very nice looking . can be used by people with small , medium or large wrists . . . . but probably not extra large . the clasp holds tightly so it never slips or falls off . great price , too . 
i love this watch . beautiful in the picture and beautiful when wearing . having some trouble with the clasp though . want to buy more of this brand . 
the color is gorgeous ~ very different . the clasp is very easy to adjust and stays securely fastened . the band is very comfortable and i really like how thin the case is . 
i received the watch today and it looks much nicer than the picture . it is very easy to adjust the length too . this watch can be worn in both casual and formal occasions . i am very satisfied with this product . 
it is tough to get a true idea of a watch ' s quality based on a photo , so i was counting on the skagen reputation for practical , quality timepieces when i ordered this watch . it arrived today , and i couldn ' t be happier . i wanted an every - day watch that was feminine without being " girly . " something with style that wouldn ' t clash with my other jewelry . this watch is all of those things . . . the color is between bronze and copper , and this combined with the square face , rounded hands , tiny diamond accents and mother - of - pearl dial makes me think art deco . it ' s a lovely piece that seems to blend with my skintone . i ' m planning on wearing this every day , but i can see how it would also work well for evening . it ' s one of those " blender " pieces that could coordinate with everything from funky / chunky to elegant and understated . the skagen latch is initially a challenge - - it ' s a dual - clasp safety system that is very effective . reference the enclosed instructions and you ' ll see it ' s quick and easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist perfectly - - no jeweler needed . finally , amazon ' s price for this watch is amazing - - around $ 60 . full retail is twice that . 
these were way too big for my kid so i gave them to someone else . they said they are extremely warm and comfortable . my only complaint is the blue pictured here is not what the socks look like 
i bought these for my 2 1 / 2 year - old grandson and they are wonderful for playing in the snow . they are warm but not too bulky in his boots . i have smartwool socks myself and i really like them . they wash & dry without shrinking . i would buy them again . 
i love these socks ! my preschool - aged son had a pair last winter for sledding and outdoor fun , but we lost 1 sock . this year , i returned to purchase 2 more pairs to prepare for this year ' s winter adventures ! these socks are super - warm and lightweight . they are not the bulky , heavy wool socks of our childhoods ! 
i got these for my toddler to wear with his snow boots . i got the xs and they fit my 18 month old with just a little room to grow and he normally wears a size 6 toddler shoe . i am very pleased with the quality and fast shipping . i wish i had bought another pair , i ' m sure we will misplace at least one of these socks before we even get any snow . 
thank you very much . it worked great and kept my daughter dry . i would buy it again if i needed to . 
nice robe . not super - heavy , but still nice , heavy material , excellent length ( long enough for someone near 6 feet tall ) . decent value . 
this is a really nice robe . it ' s very comfortable and plush , yet lightweight . the outside and inside pockets are handy too . it does run long though , i need to get mine shortened or i ' ll trip on it while going up / down the stairs . 
i am a 5 ' 8 & # 34 ; tall woman . i clarify this because it fits me , lengthwise , just a couple of inches above my ankles . if you are petite , i do not recommend this robe . sure , you could have it shortened , and that is a great option . but , also , since it is unisex , the shoulders are broader than a woman ' s robe . all of that said , i absolutely love this robe . it is heavy and warm , just what i wanted for winter . it is also beautiful . i got the robe in blue and the colors are true to the picture . 
i ordered this for my wife a long time ago for x - mas since she needed a robe . it is a very nice robe and i couldn ' t of asked for any better . my wife absolutely loves this thing , she wears it almost every night . i highly recommend this product and am glad i purchased it as a present . 
i like the roomy size . it is so cozy to put on after my shower or bath . it absorbs well . 
the robe is fairly heavy and nice and long on me . a bit much in warmer weather , but will be great come fall / winter . 
i love this robe because it is super soft . would definitely recommend this as a gift ! 
i received this robe for christmas a few years ago and it ' s just awesome . it comfortable and is still in perfect condition . i especially like how these robes are very absorbant . i ' ve had a few in the past that were heavier , but really didn ' t absorb anything . in fact my so liked it so much that she stole it from me for over a year . well , this christmas i got her one and now we are both happy : ) 
this robe is very high quality . the fabric is substantial without being bulky . it is tailored and comfortable . very flattering even on my small frame and that is hard to find in a robe . this will last for years . 
i love them and you can wear them year round . i love the style . . love the comfort and relaxing . 
i love the pants , but they are not perfect , made in china ? i prefer made in usa , the pockets could and should be larger . the quality is fair for the price . 
when i was looking for a few bdu ' s , i noticed that these were cheaper than most military surplus stores . for casual wear and lounging around their perfect . 
this is the new style , that is the old style from the 70 ' s my son love them , and would like new colors . 
i wear a 36 & # 34 ; waist which is a the small end for these pants . with the side tabs cinched all the way the fit . i wear a belt as the sides do not stay with activity . 
nice pants . i like the pant cuff drawstring . it ' s hard for me to find pants the right length . using the drawstring for & # 34 ; blousing & # 34 ; works pretty slick . the material is solid . the cargo pockets are big , i like them . 
i would recommend this product . i think some of my sisters will be purchasing for this year ' s race for the cure also . they fit nice and were fun . 
if you want to stand out and not have the usual or not so tactical color scheme , this is for you . this fits me great , it is not too loose and not too tight . as a child i used to wear one that came with my rambo t - shirt and me being nostalgic of the past and goofy , i wanted to relive that moment and yet change it up a bit since i ' m older . the colors from the image on here match what it is in real life so do not expect a bright purple but slightly toned down . 
i bought these for my son ' s scout campout where they went caving . the caves they were exploring had water wells that they had to walk through and my son said these pants were comfortable even wet . they dried quickly and were comfortable the entire caving tour . he asked for a couple more pair in different colors . he also had enough storage in the pants to keeps waterproof bags of items in them . they wash well & seem very sturdy . the boys that wore jeans are now asking for bdu ' s for future events . these pants run true to size and my ex - marine hubby said they seem well constructed . we will be getting more for our son and a couple pair for my husband . 
my husband and i recently ordered a few pairs of these pants . we couldn ' t be any happier with this purchase . they are comfortable , durable and priced perfectly . 
it ' s good for a costume , the seems on the inside are a little hap hazard and the zipper on the fly doesn ' t have a stopper at the top but apart from that i ' ve owned these for a few years now and they ' re still kicking . 
i love camo pants because of the heavy , durable material they ' re made of . i ' ve taken a few falls on the road in these and wash them often , and you can tell they are good quality . 
purchased these for work pants and was completely unprepared for how comfortable they are , and handy . so many pockets , i wear these around the house . 
ok . i used to love rothco bdu ' s . but they seem to have no quality control , as 3 out of the 4 i ordered in the last month are defective . direct premium buys and army universe are no help either . dpb promised not to charge me a re - stock fee , then did anyway ( after sending me more defective pants , which i again had to pay to ship back to them ) . these companies keep charging me money , and i still don ' t have my darn pants ! i will be ordering my bdu ' s through lapg from now on . 
i just loved these comando cargo pants , they are made with a very resistant material and they look great and out of the ordinary . 
he loves these pants and would wear them everyday if i would let him . they fit well and are made from a thick material . seems like they will hold up to anything . the ties at the bottom help keep them from dragging under his feet . i would definitely buy them again . 
would give a 5 star rating , but the cost seams high to me , plus pockets & belt loops could be bigger . the are comfortable & the camoflauge is good . size ( 3x ) is perfect , and good on length . 
comfortable , just a little thinner than i thought they would be . my husband and i got them for air soft matches . . . . and they do a good job . fit is good . 
really well made pants . nice adjustments with the waist straps on both sides , i love these , i have 4 pairs now . 
i love the look of these pants . . . . i just ordered three different color schemes of these pants and two have arrived including this pair . . . . both pair fit great and look great . . . the only reason i am not giving 5 stars is that the material is kind of thin , and i dont know how well they will hold up , but they should hold up for years . . . probably should give them a 5 , but nothing is really perfect is it . . ? ? 
i ordered the purple , the fabric is much stiffer than other pairs of cargo pants i have gotten , they are ok but i don ' t love them . 
to anyone that likes pants that are durable and will last for years , these pants are the way to go ! ! ! i have many different styles of the pants as well as colors . i have no problems with these pants . i have had them for a while now and have purchased them previously . i spend much of my time outdoors and i have had nothing but strength and durability . i have had embers jump from a fire and land on my leg . . . . lo and behold it burnt my leg but not the pants , awesome strength ! ! ! 
these are falsely advertized as being bdu / acu with a button fly . the ones i received have a zipper fly . the seat is not reinforced as is the norm with bdu / acu . dont waste your money or your time on these cheap imitations ! 
i was taking a stab at what size i would need . i own a pair from a million years ago that are xl . they are big , so i thought i would buy a l . turns out , i need a medium . no worries , i still love them . great pants , great color , i love everything about them . 
the colors are alot brighter than the picture shows and they fall right off . i gave them to a friend 
great fit nice material wore them the same day they arrived will probably get a few more with different camo designs 
kind of like my old ( mid 80 ' s ) army bdu ' s . nice material , seems sturdy enough for every day wear at work . maybe just a little big on the sizing , but that ' s ok with me since i like ' em a little loose . recommended ? yes 
they feel comfrontable they are adjustable and they stay on and don ' t fall off matches my bdu shirt so all and all good 
these are the real deal and fit just as i knew they would ! ! this is the fifth pair of cams ive bought on amazon and i know bdus ! if you want a great set of well built form fitting in the right places bdus then these are for you . buy them for the size waist you are as they allow them to be two belt sizes bigger through the use of the zip ties on the sides of the waist which you can cinch them to the actual size waist you are . the front of the side pockets are hemmed tight to the thigh in front but the back is loose so they look good as a set of casual cool looking pants without looking messy and baggy due to the pockets . buy these if you are looking for form , fit , style , durability and a great price with fast shipping ! ! they have button flys and pockets that are well stitched and tight when fastened . the buttons are secured very strong and they do not come unbuttoned ever . great bdus ! ! they will see my name on a lot more purchases thats for sure ! 
good for teenagers playing air soft and survivalists , i guess . digital bdu pattern hmmm . . well it fit so the sizing chart was correct and it arrived on time . the price was good . what more can i say 
a good quality shirt . i can ' t say much about the sizing because i don ' t regularly buy clothing for kids , but it did fit the recipient child . 
i ordered this one for my son for xmas 2012 . he likes dragons & i ' ve purchased other dragon shirts for him in the past , they seem to be the only articles of clothing i can buy for him that are above complaint . let ' s hope when he opens this one on christmas morning my perfect record remains intact ! lol ! i ' ll be 5 for 5 then ! wish me luck ! tee graphix are pretty cool & it arrived really quik thank you ! 
fast service . nice shirt . a little stiff , but should mellow with age . graphics are very nice , and look like they will last , unlike some . 
this is the second purchase of this particular shirt , as my eldest son grew out of the other one . so happy that the seller has this in small adult size to accomodate young teens ! great quality and weight to the mountain shirts , and they are a & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; company as well - - we have been buying their shirts for many years . 
this is a very cool dragon shirt . as always , the mountain makes nice quality shirts . there is no icky , scratchy tag in the back , either . this dragon is enormous and awesome ! very nice & cool looking shirt . i love this shirt . 
i love these sandals . i have arthritis in both big toes , and these cushion perfectly so i can walk without pain . i own several pair in different colors . first thing on my feel summer mornings . 
these sandals are very comfy . they stay on your foot with the well - placed straps . they are a little squishy on the footbed and quite nice for tender feet . the sole is very firm and protects the foot from sharp things when walking , like mesquite thorns and sharp gravel . 
i am not a flip flop person , since i do not like the loose fit , usually thin soles and i do not like the flip flop noise . however , i enjoyed being able to slip on and off the soft flips that i had and loved the soft cushion , though too thin . these tevas are thicker , soft and cushioned with a bit of arch support . a nice fit and look so nice ! i have a stone floor and wanted slippers that really cushion . these do the trick ! they are completely black , though , not a color mix . totally comfy and dressy to boot ! 
these are so comfortable and have traction . i do not worry about slipping like my old shoes . i want more . 
very very comfortable flip flops - and durable ! these are sturdy enough to wear on moderate hikes and stay on even when wet . they can also go with a dress for a night on the time . 
they are very pretty . i have another pair in black that i ' ve had for awhile . they hold up very well and are very comfortable . one of the reasons i ' m such a fan of this style is because of the straps . so unique . i ' d recommend these to any one . the sizing is true as well . it gives you a little room to surround your foot so it ' s not slipping off the sides . 
i ' m a lifelong fan of this particular style of teva . this shoe for some reason however leaves black stains on the bottom of my feet . i ' m still wearing it , just need to now wash my feet every night before i go to bed . 
purchased for my wife , her 2nd pair , and she will buy another when these wear out , comfortable and great looking 
love these shoes ! i could live in them all summer long ! they go with all kinds of outfits , and they are sturdy and light . i even hike in them ! 
i bought a pair of these sandals several years ago . i have worn them almost daily - - i live in the south , so they are always in season . they have an arch support built in , and are the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn - - light , well - cushioned and supportive . recently , my daughter was complaining that her feet hurt . i bought these for her . she loves them as much as i do . i heartily recommend them for anyone ! ( the strap system comes far enough forward on your foot , that your toes don ' t shift to the side , which is a problem for both of us with many thong style sandals . ) 
perfect . comfortable . 
bought these as a present , am sure she will love them , cannot beat tevas for comfort and looks . great , super comfy , summer shoe . my teenage and middle school grandchildren love this shoe . 
i purchased these flip flops for casual wear , but i find that i want to wear them all the time . they are so comfortable ! i even wore them the other day when my husband and i did one of our 3 - 4 mile walks , and they were perfect . i bought these in all black , but now i ' m ready to order some more in other colors . 
i received the sandals very quickly . i am not thrilled with the shoes . the soles compressed rather quickly so they feel less substantial than when i first got them . wouldn ' t order them again . i am disappointed because i have ordered teva flip flops in the past and been very happy with them . 
i absolutely love these sandals but my pinkie toe slips out . they are beautiful and comfortable . i am hoping the stretch just a little so that my pinkie stays in . 
bought these to replace flipflops that broke . my foot runs medium to slightly wide ( b / c width ) , and i ' d seen reviews saying they were tight . however , they fit perfectly , and are really comfortable for my foot . 
i was a little skeptical ordering these sandals online but they are the most comfortable flip flops i have ever own . i ended up ordering a second pair in black so that i could wear them at work . they are " dressy " enough to wear on casual fridays at work and look great with a summer skirt or dress . i ' m usually a size 7 . 5 and i ordered my sandals in size 7 and they are a perfect fit . highly recommend it and fabulously as stylish beach shoes . 
i haven ' t been a fan of flip flops since 2003 when i wore some on vacation and developed plantar fasciatis and suffered with it for 4 yrs . my feet are finally better , but i haven ' t found flip flops that feel comfortable enough to wear for extended periods . these are great . some features i love : soft feeling of the foot bed , a decent amount of arch support , thong that doesn ' t rub toes , the cute strappy style . i imagine they will become even more comfortable with time as my foot molds to the shoe . they come in a huge variety of colors , and priced at $ 15 to $ 20 , they are definitely worth it . i may invest in a few more colors . 
i love them there comfortable and easy to wear would buy more if i found cute ones i would recommend them to anyone who wants comfortable sandals . 
i picked these sandals up last summer to wear in the house . i have plantar fascitis in one foot and am supposed to wear shoes at all times . these sandals fit my long narrow feet just perfectly and offer great support too . they are also comfortable on top and the toe thong does not cut at all . i am typically a 9 . 5 in most shoes and ordered up in this sandal based on other reviews . i like this sandal so much that i ordered another pair to wear outside and also ordered a pair for my mother - in - law who also has narrow feet and needed something comfortable but also not too floppy to wear around the house . she could not believe how great these sandals are , especially for the current price ! ( under $ 20 . ) highly recommended . 
i have bought several pairs of tevas the past , but these things to be smaller than normal . you have to wear them a while to break into them , but other than that they ' re pretty good . 
i bought these for the pool , beach , summer . . . they are very comfortable and easy to walk in . my dog chewed the first pair so had to get another . more support than ordinary flip flops . my daughter liked them so much she got a pair . i ' ll probably come back for another pair in a different color . 
just didn ' t quite fit me right . they are attractive , and would probably work for someone else , but they aren ' t as easy to slip on as i ' d hoped . 
i bought this ( in addition to my wonderful regular flip flop tevas ) to hold it to my foot better while walking for travel , since the last strap is closer to the heel . i think it will work , but until the straps stretch out ( i believe they will ) , they are a bit slow to get on . 
i love teva ' s and have worn them for years . i was a little disappointed that they are not as cushy as they used to be . the soles are harder and not quite as thick as my last pairs . i still like them , just not as much . 
nice look - the straps are slim enough to look feminine . takes a bit of time to get used to the toe strap - but i really like them . 
these are super comfortable to wear . they never get hot and they stay on really well because of the extra straps . i get lots of compliments on them too . 
good quality flip flops , comfortable and true size . planning on getting another pair . really good for the price . love them . 
i thought $ 25 for flip flops was crazy . i thought they should be of better quality since they are tevas ! not very study , very lightweight , not what i would expect of $ 25 flip flops ! 
when i first go the sandals they felt a bit on the tight side . but as i wore them around the house they compressed and became more comfortable . my only concern is where the straps lay . i ' d prefer them to sit a bit higher over the top of my foot . they seem to slouch low over the course of the day , so i have to keep adjusting them . not a deal breaker though . 
my sister loved these shoes . very comfortable and worth the money . we would recommend and would purchase again . great shoes 
i love these sandals ! ! they are the perfect lightweight casual summer sandal . they are very comfortable and the straps do not dig into your foot at all . they do not offer half sizes so i ordered a size up , still fits great . 
i love love love these comfy , durable summer sandals . they ' re perfect with skirts , capris and shorts . i have them in several colors and wear them daily . 
i seem to buy a new pair of these every other year . they hold up very well and are comfortable . the straps hug my feet nicely and do not rub or cause any blistering . overall great sandal , would recommend to anyone that doesn ' t have wide feet . 
bought a new pair of olowahu flip flops after my first pair got seriously used up , which took about ten years . unlike most flip flops , these stay on your feet . they also have a lot more substance than the cheap - o flip flops i used to buy . the colors are fun too . 
teva size 8 , all my other brands i wear a 7 1 / 2 . please measure your foot and order based on the teva shoe chart . i purchased these ( black pair , brown pair - which i have worn twice ) a little over 4 yrs ago along with the dozer ( dozer model has changed ) . florida weather lets the flip flop freaks skip with joy pretty much all year . i also am known to throw on the toe socks for cool weather so i can still wear these . i expected them to last for a little while given the reliability of the brand but not this long and not after what they have been through . everyday these find their way to my feet . ( really everyday ) . the strapping is great to hold these on with out throwing them off your feet when walking . they have made it through several hikes , mud and snow ( with toe socks , lol ) . they mold over time to your feet ( toes included ) . yes , if your are in the sun you will have some funky tan lines . they also have a very slight arch which is perfect . price point is excellent for the life of this shoe . i wasn ' t hesitant to pay it because the brand is excellent in durability and quality . 
overall these tevas are very comfortable . tevas are always well made , and the sole is very cushy . the only problem i had is with the straps when i first started wearing them . after wearing all day , because the straps are made of a braided nylon / plastic fabric , the tops of my feet and around the tops of my big toes were a little sensitive , but i did not get blisters . after wearing several times , it feels like i ' ve broken them in and no longer run into this problem . just as comfortable as reefs , and i think more so than havaianas . 
these are the best flip flops ever ! they are so comfy and stay put on my narrow feet . they can be dressed up or down . 
i am a huge teva fan and have about 4 pairs in the original thong style . i wanted something a little more strappy and decided to give these a try since i already really enjoy teva sandals . these did not disappoint . i have a wide foot so the straps need to be stretched out a bit so it took a few wears until they fit my feet better . after that they were perfect . i live in the city so i do a lot of walking and wanted something that wouldn ' t give me a ton of blisters . these worked well and have such a thick sole that there is no way these can ' t be comfortable for a days walk . would recommend to anyone who does a lot of walking and wants i slightly nicer , very comfortable flip flop . 
we have bought many pair of these now and love them . myself and both my daughters each have them . we get compliments on them all the time , because people think they look so great . and they are super comfy ! ! 
they are very comy , but it does take a bit to break them in . . . the part that goes between the toes , took a couple of days . . the right one still bothers me some , but wearing them . . . : ) love them . . great price for comfort , and as always , fast ship . . 
these are the best every - day - comfy sandals . i have them in three colors and they are the most comfortable pair of summer sandals i have worn . 
i already had a pair of these flip flops when i saw them on amazon . they probably run narrow for a person with medium width . i have a narrow foot and they are just a little wide for me . i wear them all the time here at the house and when i am at the beach . 
i purchased a size 8 and it fits true to size , these are very comfy and cushy . the color is just like the picture and they look really good on ! 
i so highly recommend these sandals . they not only feel wonderful the first time you put them on , but you ' ll get so many compliments each time you wear them . i chose little bay mystic and the ocean bluish - green plaid was such a gorgeous color to use . wish i didn ' t have so many other sandals , i ' d buy another pair . you won ' t be disappointed . 
teva is a long time favorite of mine , and it seems like it ' s harder and harder to find brilliant colors of them . i would like these in every color ! 
wasn ' t sure about these at first but once i broke them in i was convinced ! they feel good and look a little better than regular flip flops ! 
i ' m sure this would be a comfortable sandal but i have a narrow foot and not a high instep so the straps were too big and gapped . i have this problem with most sandals though . 
i love the neutrality of the color . . . and the fit is perfect . . . and they are sooooo comfortable ! ! ! 
these shoes only came in a & # 34 ; medium & # 34 ; width , i ' d prefer a wide . they will work for my trip coming up . the soul of the shoe is amazing , soft yet thick enough to be worn on rocky paths . 
i ' ve gotten these shoes every summer , and always order size 6 . this year , they were way too big . i got the fives , and they were perfect . 
teva flops offer super comfort & support . they hold up extremely well & fit great . my favorite brand hands & feet down ! 
i really like the look of these sandals , in fact , i used to own a pair that looked identical to them and that ' s why these caught my eye . the soles are very squishy and comfortable , but the straps on top dug into my pinkie toes . i do not have a wide foot at all , but maybe these are made for extra narrow feet ? i ended up returning them . 
such a soft and cushy sole ! i have heels that crack after wearing normal flip flops for a few days in a row . i wore these all summer last year and my heels never cracked ! i get lots of compliments and i love them . i wish i could rate them 100 stars ! ! ! ! ! the one weird thing : they are a kind of odd textured foot bed and i wore them to the beach once when they were pretty new and sand got almost like rubbed into the foot bed . after a few wearings it all came out . kinda weird . never happened again . and didn ' t effect the wearing as far as i can tell . i bought the brown last year . ill be getting the black this year : ) fits true to size . maaaaaybe a tiny bit on the smallish side . took one wearing or so to stretch them into the perfect shape . 
these are amazingly comfortable and look nice enough to wear to work ( as a teacher ) . downsides are that they get smelly after a few wearings - but i ' ve thrown them in the wash and they come out fine . the biggest disappointment was that even though i ' ve only had them 6 weeks , the soles are already losing their tread and they are becoming slippery on wet surfaces , even outside on cement . 
these are my second pair after having the same pair for almost 5 years . i wanted flip flops that had a hard sole so i would stop slipping when it was wet . these are amazing . the criss cross straps are very comfortable . the foot bed shapes to your foot and then there ' s the strong sole to give you plenty of traction . these are great everyday flip flops and totally worth the price . 
most comfortable sandal . great for back and i had back surgery . 2nd pair i bought . first pair are worn out . luv them . 
i live in these shoes - they are very durable and comfortable for gardening and farm work or running errands . this year i bought my sixth pair . everyone calls them my summer work boots . 
my shoe size is a 6 c . the 6 medium fits me fine . it is a comfortable , nice - looking sandal and seems sturdy . 
this style of teva has been a favorite of mine for about 6 years now , my last pair were starting to wear thin , so it was time to get some new ones , ( they tend to last me about 12 - 18 months with regular warm - weather wear . ) i usually get black but this time i went with the blue / pink design . i sort of wish i had stuck with black , but they are cute . honestly , i just don ' t know how you can go wrong with teva ' s strappy flip flops . they are great for a skirt , jeans , dress , shorts , just about any spring or summer outfit . they are cushy and leave interesting tan marks . . . in my experience they don ' t tend to start stinking like some sandals , but they also have held up a to a few soapy scrubs when they got something slimy on them . they are also super lightweight and easy to walk in . i know this won ' t be my last pair . 
i had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes . this makes it really uncomfortable and i have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap . nice colors , not very cushy sole because it ' s so thin and overall very sorry i bought them without trying first . 
i order several in different colors , i wore them all day at dollywood and my feet never hurt me . the colors are great . i had bought my first pair in a local store and loved they , i looked on amazon and found more colors and have order all colors but 2 and have they in my cart . 
this runs long and narrow especially for & # 34 ; older feet & # 34 ; the narrow is a drawback over the toes . cute though and comfortable sole . 
i normally wear a size 9 and i have wide feet . i initally ordered a size 9 from teva . com and even got free 2 day shipping . the flip flops are lovely ( i ordered the poppy red ) but were way too snug . . . i called teva and they offered to overnight me a size 10 for free ! they arrived today as promised and they are perfect . these are great flip flops . . . if you want them . . . get them ! and consider ordering from teva . . . their service is really great . 
this flip flop is the most comfortable , most durable you can buy in my opinion . i buy these for my wife and i have to basically buy a new one to get her to stop wearing the old one . not because they look bad , but she deserves something nice every now and then and this is it . she loves wearing these . they have 5 straps and are hands down the most comfortable and easily kept on flip flops out there . i bet she could run a race in these baby ' s . recommended . 
i have to say these are so comfortable . had a pair a size down , but they were a little snug accross the foot . this year i purchased my standard size ( i usually go down a size with anything open toed ) and the sole has some traction and are very comfortable . i cannot recommend these enough ! i hope you love them too ! 
they fit nicely and no breakin blisters . i have the same ones in red and am thinking purple next . good buy ! 
super cute sandals and very comfortable . the colors are great . . . love the hot pink . i can see myself buying more of these . 
i bought this for my 10 yr old daughter who has very skinny narrow feet and it fit perfectly . i have no idea how an average adult foot would fit in this shoe . we ordered size 6 ' blue color and length was true to size , blue was vibrant and the strap were thick , high quality . much better than the traditional flip flops . 
this is my fourth pair in this style because they fit my narrow feet and help conceal a growing bunion . i can wear them on warm rainy days because the foot bed is not slick . they are also nice enough for work . 
when i first put these shoes on they felt really awkward on my foot . after about 10 minutes it seemed like they had perfectly shaped to my foot . i wear them all the time and will buy another pair when these wear out . 
ok , so they look good , they fit ( they are a bit tight ) and they have lovely cushy soles , but for the life of me i can hardly walk in them ! 
i ordered these as a birthday gift . they arrived nicely packaged and in a very timely fashion . they were packed with teva product information . my daughter ( and i ) were very pleased with my purchase . 
straps are very tight across . if you have narrow feet , this is the shoe for you . they do support the arch nicely but are not made for medium - width feet . 
this shoe is very comfortable more than i would have thought . i bought a pair of teva flip flops and disliked them but these sandals are so comfy i will be ordering another pair ! update : these shoes are so great , i have two pairs and wish i had more ! love them ! 
i love the sandal and the length is just perfect for my foot , however , the straps are way too tight and i don ' t think i ' m going to chance that they will stretch out . 
i have several pairs in all sorts of patterns and colors . i love this flip flop . you can cruise through the mall in style and also do some heafty walking for exercise , it ' s wonderful . i even buy them as gifts . thanks teva ! 
soft . comfortable . secure . lasts all summer . cute . comes in many color options . lightweight & super packable . just enough support & i have foot problems ( i used to only be able to wears birks ) . what more cold you ask for in a summer shoe ! i wear 2 pairs , switching them back & forth , every summer . they last all summer & even into the fall . yay ! 
these are pretty neat sandals . only thing i ' m not wild about is the piece between the toes . it ' s a bit uncomfortable , but seems to be getting a little less irritating the more i wear these , so i think that it will soften up and be more comfortable over time . the rest of the straps do not irritate at all . i think these are very cute little strappy sandals , and would give them five stars if not for that piece between the toes . 
these are as comfortable as a flip flop can be , with arch support and verycushioned foot bed . colors are pretty too . this is my second pair , i love these . 
absolutely love these ! bought them in black and would buy them again . i have a wide foot , but they were perfect . so comfortable . the bands are all stretchy , so there is no & # 34 ; new - shoe breaking - in & # 34 ; process . they are pliable , yet sturdy . dress them up or down . i wear them everywhere ! love , love , love ! 
i love teva mush flip flops all styles and colors . . . i don ' t think i could have enough . i bought 2 pair last year and wore them out so i restocked this year and love this style , it ' s a little fancier than standard flip flops . 
not made for walking long distances , but they ' re really cute flip flops and they ' re quite comfy too . for walking long distances , i ' ll probably order a different type of teva sandals . but these work wonderfully for short trips to the grocery store on hot days . 
you can ' t go wrong with teva ' s . comfortable and no rubbing . 
if you have wide feet , this is not the sandal for you . they are narrow and i ended up cutting off one of the straps which was completely unnecessary to the fit of this sandal . should pass that on to teva who could save money from eliminating this one strap that digs into your little toe ! 
this is a nice sandal , however , it runs big and also i found the straps to be loose , my foot would not stay in the shoe . they looked nice and the soles were very soft to walk in . i need good arch support and this shoes unfortunately did not provide . 
they are okay , but too pricey for what they are . basically , they are a rubber flip flop with extra straps . not what i expected and i won ' t buy them again . ten dollars would have been a better price . oh well , i know for next time . 
i could walk miles in these flip flops ; can ' t say the same for many others . i usually wear an 8 . 5 , but ordered 8s and they fit perfectly . go with almost every summer outfit , so comfortable and stylish . i ' m going to have to invest in many more ! 
i wear a size 11 so finding shoes or sandals can be a challenge . i ordered these and they fit like a dream . even offering support in the arch of my foot . surprising for a " flip flop " . the way they are constructed , with the straps across the top of the foot , make them feel more like a regular type sandal than a flip flop . 
i love tevas - i have several pairs of sturdy sandals . i like the idea of flip flops and would love to find comfortable ones . i figured if anybody could make flip flops comfortable , teva could do it . they are comfortable - well , for the first 15 minutes or so . however , they are flip flops - they ' re okay , but comfortable to walk in . . . not really . for flip flops they are quite okay . i was expecting to really like them - but my love of teva doesn ' t overcome my dislike for flip flops . they are a lot dressier than regular flip flops ( on the continuum of dressy they are really only dressy compared to other flip flops ) , and only marginally more comfortable . 
love it ! love it ! love it ! love it ! love it ! very comfortable shoe . it has a good fit . the quality is very high . i will be buying more teva sandals . 
i love the way these fit and feel . they are very soft and i can walk a ways in these . great flip - flop ! ! ! 
very cute and comfortable . you can ' t beat the price and i love the little pop of style that sets these apart from ordinary flip flops . you can very easily wear these for casual or even with an outfit that may be a little more dressy . very versatile ! 
these are the best flip flops i ' ve ever purchased . they form to my foot and feel great . i lost a pair in ecuador and ordered a new pair the minute i got home . i wear them every day in the summer and my feet never get tired . 
this shoe ia cute and holds my foot a bit more than the regular flip flop , that i also have and like . it has the expected revamp quality . 
what i received is cute , fur lined , well sewn . it is true to size . i wear 9 . 5 , and ordered 9 in these because the first pair really was way too long to be an accurate 9 . 5 . these are snug , but think they will stretch . i have narrow feet and they are good . i did not yet contact the company about this error , so i cannot say as to how they would respond . they have a thin but firm man made sole . these will be good for keeping at work when i need to slip into something more comfortable or when i drive to work in my scrumptious acorn chinchilla slippers and forget to bring a pair fo shoes to change into ( happened once ! ) . minnetonka makes very high quality products - the low score is for sending me the wrong model - not even anything close . the delivery is fast and they have good packing . 
this type of moccasin used to be a favorite of mine . the style of the boot has changed . it runs very small and is very flimsy . 
these are so comfortable ! i ' ve heard great things about minnetonka in the past and decided to give them a go and do not regret it ! they are perfect and super cute . i wouldn ' t walk in the rain with them . . but hey , they work for me ! 
these are very comfortable . at first , i though they are so narrow they would never fit . but they do stretch nicely as you wear them . some people have bought them 1 / 2 size smaller as they stretch , but i bought the normal size i wear and that works . 
wore these in high school . i have been looking for over 30 years for these and am delighted to find them at a reasonable price . fit is wonderful . 
i read several reviews and knowing that they are leather and will stretch i ordered a full size down . however , they seem to run a size and a half larger , as even though i ordered a size down they are too large . it isn ' t horribly large though and i will hand onto these , but wish i had ordered a size and a half or two full sizes smaller . i think , the thing is , that these are men ' s sizes , not womens . 
these shoes are the most amazing shoes ! they ' re the craziest amount of comfortable that youve ever felt . plus i get compliments on them all of the time . i agree with the other reviewers . you need to & # 34 ; season & # 34 ; them first before you wear theme everywhere but they are an outdoor / every day shoe . i waterproofed them two days in a row and then wore them around by backyard only for the first couple of weeks . it really helped them to be a shoe that is able to be worn all of the time . this sole is durable ! this will be a shoe that you have for many years to come ! 
although the right size , they fit wrong and felt funny on my feet . i have always wanted a pair , but they just did not work for me . i will keep searching for the right pair . 
i have worn these same moccasins since 1973 in high school . they still are cool ~ like the bellbottoms we wore that are now the craze . i love the fact that these are the soft sole version . . they are the best . i see mocs with hard soles & laugh cuz they look so dorkey ! thanx for making the real thing ! they are awesome ! 
these are the most comfortable moccassins i have owned in a long time . they are the real deal ! i couldn ' t be more pleased with this purchase ! 
i ordered this because i started having a mild case of plantar fasciitis . my running coach advised me to go barefoot as much as possible . this did the trick ! just like being barefoot with minimal protection . 
love the minnetonka classic fringe bootie accidentally picked the wrong size but just changed to my right size and everything ' s okay they ' re so cute you can wear them with dresses shorts skirts skinny jeans basically whatever you want they will look good so grab you a pair you won ' t be disappointed very comfortable true to size . i bought the black . 
there are several other moccasin makes , and the price and quality vary greatly . the quality of these are good , but there are other name brands that have the sheepskin inside , which keeps your tootsie ' s warm . 
i was concerned about the fit and read all the reviews . my foot is 10 . 5 exactly but i almost always go with size 11 - they feel better , more roomy etc . i like things loose . in this case , because these are all leather , i went with my exact shoe size of 10 . 5 figuring they would stretch a little . and , they did - and i love them . these moccasins work beautifully for me . they felt a little rough at first with the laces rubbing the top of my foot a little uncomfortably . after a few hours , everything started to come together and they were stretching to fit my feet like a glove . i should say i only wear these barefoot . for socks i definitely would have had to go with size 11 . i should say , i had to loosen up the laces - they were tied to tightly out of the box and that ' s why they were rubbing annoyingly on the top of my foot . new sneakers are the same for me every time . i ' ll probably do the water trick and wet them down and wear them for a few hours so that they truly fit my feet perfectly . but , they ' re so close already at this point , after a few days , i may skip that trick . very happy with these . if they last for any length of time - like a year or more - i ' ll buy again in a heartbeat and they have a customer for life . super comfortable . 
ohhh . . . . just what i needed . . . feet don ' t hurt on tile = happy person . . . repeat . . . happy person . . . jksdhklajsdhlkjwdeklj oand a a 
however , with some adjustments of the straps , i made it fit nicely . the leather in these moccasins is soft , wearable with or without socks and is comfortable all day . we ' ve had some hot weather lately and i was worried it might bore holes in the bottom of these shoes , but it hasn ' t . they ' re sturdy too . i wouldn ' t play basketball in them but they ' re great lounging shoes and great office shoes . i wear them to work all the time now . i definitely have less stress while wearing these than i would a pair of tennis shoes or dress shoes . plus i can walk quietly with these and not leave a traceable shoe - tread . i mean , i don ' t know why i ' d want to stealthily evade someone or anything , but if i had to , these would help in that endeavor . 
i bought these for my husband because the ones he had like them were worn to the point of having holes in them . he loves these and they look great and fit perfectly . 
fit true to size . my husband was a sock wearer . all his socks were wearing out so i bought these because he is not a house - slipper type guy . he loves these ! he puts them on everyday when he comes home from work . he says they are so comfortable he forgets he ' s wearing them ! and they look nice enough to run out to the store , without changing ! love ' em ! ! highly recommend ~ 
well made , utterly comfortable , gives me the opportunity to " earth " ( be right on the ground , not removed by a rubber sole ) . i bought two pair since i like them that much ! highly recommend ! 
i love these booties for my casual environment work . they are so very comfortable , look fine . regular length trousers hid the fringe . nice with gray pants . these really help both comfort any balance . well made . they really do run long . i have narrow feet and they fit me perfectly - i do not recommend these for wide feet . 
the pictures i saw of these shoes led me to believe i was getting sturdy , comfortable shoes with a rounded toe . in person the suede is very thin and so is the bottom . the base is also not wide enough for my feet so it feels strange to walk in them . the worst part is the toe , which is not rounded but square on my pair . i actually thought i ' d been sent the wrong pair initially . i hate square toes because they look masculine on me . the only thing these look ok with are flared jeans . i ' m tempted to give them away . 
i ordered these for myself and they are so comfortable and cute . can wear them with anything . item is exactly as described . 
i own a couple pairs if minnetonka boots and these are by far they most comfortable . i think the zipper placement has a lot to do with it . the pair i have that zips on the side hurts my ankle . i think with the zipper in the back they have more give when you ' re walking . i was worried that i wouldn ' t like the hard sole as opposed to the nub sole , but it ' s really made from quite flexible material . i love these boots . i wish they made the double fringe with a back zipper ! ! they do start out rather narrow , but they break in really nicely . i don ' t usually wear shoes around the house but these are so comfy i forget to stop and take them off ! ! 
came early and i love them . they are warm and i wear them inside the house along with certain outfits outside the home . some people dig em , some people don ' t . they can kiss my as . i love them . they don ' t understand my glamour . 
i was happy to see that as well as the usual browns and black these came in grey . it was just what i was looking for . the fit is a little large . i usually wear 10 and 9 . 5 is pleanty long . i think someone with wide feet might find them to be narrow . will see how they hold up . 
i have these as well as the 3 fringe boots and while i love them both , i tend to wear these more . i think the 3 fringe boots are perfect for spring ( adorable with dresses and skirt and shorts ) while these are better for fall ( i have the pile lined ones for winter ) . i like that i can wear these with straight leg and skinnies and they still look adorable . it looks very casual chic to wear these with ankle length straight leg jeans all frumpled around the top . these are really comfortable and work well as everywhere shoes . i ' m considering buying a pair or two in another color to supplement these . i really wear them everywhere and with everything . i can even get away with wearing them to work sometimes . my boss has a pair of the tramper boots as well . they are insanely comfortable , with a nicely padded footbed , soft suede upper , and very flexible sole . the grip on these is not quite as good as the kilty mocs , with the little rubber nubby things , but they are still grippy . i navigated across a sheet of ice yesterday without issue . i have walked up to 4 miles at a time in these without a single blister . while there is very little arch support , i never find that to be painful in minnetonkas , not sure why . i found them true to size . i have narrow - ish feet with very tapered toes ( big toe is the longest ) . if you have wider feet you might want to size up . these are probably my favorite minnetonkas i ' ve bought and way way way more versatile than they look . 
i read previous reviews and i got a smaller size . i got a 6 . 5 and i am normally 7 - 7 . 5 . they looks great , and feel great on . love them ! 
these are beautiful , well made , but very narrow ! i had to return mine . hopefully they will create a wider variety . 
exactly as described ! 
kinda impossible to go wrong with kiwi brown . it ' s been around forever and it just does what it ' s supposed to do . definitely recommend . great packaging design , too . 
having opened many , many tins of kiwi polish while in the army , i soon learned that the easiest way to tell a good , fresh can of polish is whether or not the polish is cracked when you open it . if it ' s cracked it ' s old and drying out . these weren ' t cracked . kiwi , as always , delivers a high quality product that ' s fresh and full of wax . fast shipping from the retailer and a consistent shine across all my brown boots and shoes . this is a darker brown that will definitely recolor your boots / shoes if they are of a lighter tan . so look for a tan color if your boots / shoes are lighter than medium brown . no complaints here and the price is right . 
i ' ve been using kiwi for 30 years . normally i buy stuff like this local but i wasn ' t able to find this color . if a person wants their smooth leather boots to last and look good , this and saddle soap will help . 
so perhaps i need to know what " tan " means . i tried brown on a pair of shoes but it was too dark and i tried tan but it was too light . maybe i should just use neutral . 
hubby has shoes over 40 years old , he is so proud of them . it was great that he found the perfect polish ! 
kiwi is a great product , but cordovan is not available in local stores so it was a pleasure to find it on amazon . i only have one pair of wine shoes but they are definitely in need of polish - so thank you for making this available . 
exactly what i had expected . worked miracles for my navy boots . wish i had found this earlier . an addition to my shoe closet ! 
i had a hard time finding tan shoe polish so amazon was the easiest choice for me . the tin of polish looked slightly aged but i honestly don ' t care as it works just fine . i am pleased - no surprises . 
it ' s a great shoe polish , what else is there to say ? it goes on nicely , has a good color , and is pretty cheap . 
it ' s hard to find in shops , so i strongly suggest you buy it here . it ' s kiwi shoe polish . . . quality hasn ' t changed in decades . 
if you ' ve got brown or oxblood shoes , this is what you want to get them to the nice maroon that looks great . 
my dress shoes always need attention . i ' d be in meetings , flying on planes , riding in cars and i was always banging my shoes on something . using a good shoe polish to recolor a scuff and put a gloss onto your shoes can make a real difference in how you look . another advantage is that polishing your shoes often also helps to waterproof the leather and keep it in good shape . i like to use a good paste or cream polish and a horse hair brush to get a high gloss . part of your appearance is your shoes and taking care of them means you care about how you present yourself in front of others ! kiwi is a good brand and i recommend it ! 
in case it isn ' t obvious from the tin ( it wasn ' t to me when i first bought it , i didn ' t have the slightest clue about shoe polishes ) , this stuff comes in a solid ( but creamy ) brick format . unfortunately , when i got the tin it was dented and the polish brick had cracked which made it particularly messy to use because little pieces would crumble off and fly everywhere . you definitely want to put some newspaper down and maybe wear the shoes you ' re polishing so you have a hand free to contain the mess . that said , this stuff gets the job done . the instructions on the tin are spot on and helped me get my new leather boots up to a nice , high - shine ( aka spray some water on shoe after you let the polish layer dry and then buff like crazy ) . 
you can get the same thing at the grocery store . about the same price i believe . classic brand . i like the solid polish better than the liquid one . 
i had to buy new tins of shoe polish this week to get my shoes up and running for the autumn / winter months . this polish is still the best out there and does a great job on my leather shoes . . . i polished my shoes last night and had someone actually tell me today that my shoes looked brand new even though they are two years old . i don ' t ever want to live without this polish ! ! it lasts forever , it does a fabulous job and you can ' t beat the price . . . i ' m glad i stocked up , it sure won ' t go to waste ! ! ! 
recieved this from the east coast in about a week after ordering , so no issues with the seller . can opens up with a twist of the turn dial , and i used a regular hand rag to apply to shoes after applying generously to rag . i used plenty of elbow grease and rubbed it in all over shoe . after i was done it looked like i just brought them home from the shoe store . looks like new , but as with any shoe polish it depends on what kind of work or walk environment as to how long the polish will last , but i didn ' t use that much so there is plenty to go around for the low price i paid . i have never used any other shoe polish before so i don ' t have anything to compare it to otherwise i would have given it 5 stars . would recommend though for sure . 
i have several pairs of dark blue leather shoes and the toes and heels get scraped up leaving a whitish color underneath . i couldn ' t find this polish at wallmart , kmart or target so i just decided to order it . it cost more because of shipping ( though it says it ships for free if you buy 25 dollars worth of stuff , you still pay for the shipping because of the cost of the polish ) . anyway , i first used it on my favorite pair of dark blue leather boots and the polish covered the scratches adequately but not completely . i could still see them lurking under the polish even after 2 coats but still , they look a lot better than before the polish . and since some of my dark blue shoes are of differing shades of dark blue , the polish blended in just fine with all of them . 
kiwi shoe polishes are my favorite , this is high quality , easy to use , and makes my shoes look a lot better . this is thick and covers scuffs perfectly . 
i ' m so happy i found this dark blue paste polish on amazon . i ' ve looked & # 34 ; forever & # 34 ; in stores but never saw a blue polish . . . an impossible feat . low and behold , here it is on amazon and i ' m thrilled . finally my search is done . this polish goes on smooth , covers nicks and shines beautifully . 
this wax definitely did not put a good shine on either my black or brown leather shoes . and on my black shoes it left behind a whitish residue in the ' stress points ' that absolutely would not buff out no matter what i tried . definitely not impressed . 
the oxblood color is not easy to come by in nyc . i was glad amazon has it ! this is a classic polish . 
i took a pair of brown shoes in to a repair shop who said he polishes shoes for ten dollars . when i got them back , they looked actually worse than when i dropped them off . . . i decided to take the task on myself . having never attempted to polish shoes before , i had to get online to figure out instructions . . . but about an hour later , i had those brown shoes looking very very good - all thanks to this polish . i am sure that there are others out there that are better polishers than i am - and they are probably using this stuff too . 
ive been using kiwi brand products for years and have never been disappointed . the can has a nice easy open feature . i also recommend the kiwi polish applicator and the polishing brush ? 
i ' ve been using kiwi polish for years . they have remained a consistently good product . in the world of rapid change it ' s good to have a reliable product . 
kiwi polish is good polish . very reliable and the colors are very consistent from one can to the next . the larger cans are a better buy . 
i ' m just getting into oxfords and i ' m using kiwi right now but i ' m not really thrilled with the results . i ' m going to try something else next . i find that when i finish the shoe , it looks great , but when i wear the shoe , the wax ends up drying or showing on the outside of the shoe and i need to go back and brush it again . i could just be doing it wrong but i don ' t think so . 
they must have sold a billion cans of this stuff - - and people buy it for a reason . very easy to apply , shines up nicely , and definitely protects the leather from damage . when i compare the cost of my shoes with the price of this polish , it ' s a major bargain ! 
used this on my brown leather dress shoes and it brought life back to them . works well and easy to apply . 
love it 
this shoe is very comfortable . it is easy on your feet . i definatelt will recommend this to others who do a lot of standing and walking . 
these shoes are wonderful , i do a lot of prolonged standing , have back and knee problems , the support is wonderful . my son told me about them as he works in a hospital and the dr ' s and nurses wear them . i had to buy everyone in my family a pair for christmas . shoebye are the best , prompt shipping and good packaging . i will continue to buy my klogs from them ! ! 
these klogs didn ' t quite fit , rubbed on the top of my feet , and were heavier than i like . i just sent them back . compared to quarks , they are heavy . 
it ' s my 2nd pair of klogs usa and i will continue to buy them because they are durable , lightweight , true to their size & very comfortable . 
i ' m a dentist and am constantly shuffling from patient to patient . i think these shoes are great for people who are on their feet a lot . i also tend to suffer from " flat feet " , and i find these shoes provide sufficient arch support . overall , great looks , comfy feel , provide a small heel . they do scuff to a minor degree , but i ' ve never had the sweaty / damp problem that other posters have mentioned . i find they are true to size ( may want to go up half size for thick socks ) . my only real gripe is that these shoes are super heavy , which one would notice if they walk around a lot in these shoes . for that reason , i also love my other pair of work shoes - merrell encore breeze 2 . i am also going to check out dansko shoes , which are also known to be super sturdy but lighter in weight than these klogs . 
i love these shoes ! i have wide feet and these are the most comfortable shoes i ' ve ever owned . ( plenty of toe room ! ) i have 5 pair and wear them all the time . 
i have an old kipling bag that is almost identical to this bag for the past 15 years . i ordered this as a replacement because the old one has finally worn out from heavy use over the years at the corners and at where the handle - strap is sewn to the body of the bag . most of the features of this new bag are well thought - out improvements to my old bag . the organizer sections ( pda , cellphone , pens ) in the large front zippered section , the 2 zippered pockets ( one for 3 - 1 - 1 toiletry ziplock , the other for inflatable pillow , pashmina , ipod etc ) and of course the trolley - sleeve in tha back that enables this bag to be slipped over trolley handles for convenience . my old bag just had one large wide pocket in the front , no organizer sections and no trolley sleeve . the one thing they did add , that i don ' t like is that the entire bag is lightly padded , presumably to help it keep its shape when partly full . this padding adds weight and bulk to this bag . it weighs - in at 2 - lbs ! my old bag was just 1 - lb . ordinarily this wouldn ' t make that much of a difference , except that this is meant to be a travel bag and discount carriers and intra - europe flights have a weight limit of 5 - kg / 11 - bs . with a laptop weighing 3 - 4 lbs , add the weight of the 3 - 1 - 1 bag and you don ' t have much to work with . i love the updates ( except for the padding ) and the new colors it now comes in ( they used to only make bags in their basic colors : navy , red , black ) and have used this bag as an overly large handbag / tote bag , an overnighter , a weekender , a gym bag , a diaper bag and of course as my carryon . this size can just squeeze by as a personal or 2nd bag on trans - atlantic / pacific flights on the larger planes . if they only removed the padding and went back to the removable semi - firm bottom panel , i would give it 5 stars . 
i have another travel bag similar in size and shape to this one , but i prefer my kipling . it gives me enough compartments for my various things . i got the blue ( not navy ) which actually matches my current luggage . this is now my bag of choice for carry - on ( purse ) when traveling . this and my rolling bag equals no bag fees ! 
love my new sherpa bag , aptly named because i do not pack light . the sleeve to go over my roll on handle is the best idea , and so convenient . i am able to carry both my ipad and kindle in their cases within the bag . due to vision problem , i have to have different glasses for different activities , this works well to carry those as well . i ned several medications , the case for those goes right in the bag . i have a small day purse that i keep inside to grab and go at my destination . the bag is lightweight even with all of my needs , shoulder straps are correct length and comfortable , and short enough to slide right under the plane seat . 
have the set and love it ! the bags hold up very well and are worth the money spent , i love the color so i can spot it when picking up my luggage . . . the sherpa travel bag has so much room , tons of pocket space and is just a wonderful bag to have . . . plan to use it for years to come as i travel the world ! 
very well made and lots of compartments , detachable shoulder strap . i really wish it had a strap across the back to slip it over the handle of a rolling bag . the back has nothing on it so it could have been done . 
my son is 14 and recently had a great growth spurt . these shoes fit him very comfortably and it was nice to see him excited about that ! 
rockport is supposed to be known for comfort , but these bad boys don ' t deliver . i suppose since rockport got taken over by new balance and then adidas , quality is being sacrificed to boost the bottom - line . if you lift up the insole you will feel underneath it is like a piece of steel . there is literally no give to the shoe . i bought them thinking they were rockports - - known for quality - - however rockport isn ' t the same compnay today . i probably could get more comfort from a $ 30 pair of shoes in a baragin bin , then these overpriced clunkers ! 
i bought these for my husband . i saw that these shoes had gotten good reviews and my primary reason for the purchase was because they were water resistant . he liked them so much , that we bought another color . 
i had purchased a black pair before and was real pleased - as a person with wide feet it is indeed difficult at most times to purchase shoes on line - am real pleased with my purchase 
good looking pair of shoes , simple style & comfortable . sole is quite soft and will not last long , dont buy expecting to use for a long time , these won ' t last a year of regular use . good price though so doesn ' t really matter 
i have recently become subject to a dress code at work which has taken me far out of my norm on footwear . so , i was looking for something quality and comfortable that i was willing to wear . the shoes fit that bill and i thought it was a reasonable price . with narrow feet it is also a godsend to be able to buy my width . 
i ordered these shoes for the special price - but keeping them because of their sturdy build and comfortable feel . they present well for business . . . yet still look somewhat & # 34 ; casual & # 34 ; . . . . and best of all - waterproof / resistant . 
these are my husbands go - to shoes for work . he gets about a year of wear out of two pairs , one brown , one black . they offer great support and he really likes them . not too dressy but perfect for the office . 
you can dress this shoe up or down . you can get away with it at work if you ' re not looking for boardroom style . it ' s a functional , comfortable shoe , but it isn ' t stylish . be aware that the leather does not have a high polish to it , so it looks more casual . but if you face a morning walk , and you have to deal with the weather , these shoes can ' t be beat . 
my husband works full time . these shoes help him get through the day with no problem . they go great with his suits and they feel comfortable when he walks . they last a long time ! 
had another pair of these shoes that i outgrew a couple years back . the others lasted a long time and were very comfortable . 
i have been buying this model for more than a decade because of its durability and comfort as a semi - dress , non - formal work shoe . i currently have two pairs that i was seeking to replace because of heel wear . the new shoes were not at all like my previous pairs . the lasts are too stiff , and the soles are made of cheap plastic rather than very durable rubber ( i think my first pairs of these had vibram soles ) . i decided to send them back . amazon declined to pay shipping because i said it was an " unexpected style " issue . i would like to dispute this , but i don ' t know where to do that . 
the thick soles and available wide width sizes drew me to this pair of oxfords . while rockport men ' s northfield oxfords address both of these critical requirements , i find them lacking style . the product photos are accurate but they shoes just seem more drab when they are on your feet . in fact , they remind me of the shoes my elementary school janitor wore . that being said , i appreciate the thick soles , which are quite beneficial when navigating puddles and slush . despite having the thick soles , the shoes are quite light . my previous thick - soled shoes , the kenneth cole building block , had much better aesthetics and significantly heavier soles . unfortunately , these are no longer manufactured . other thick soled alternatives included lugz , doc martins , gbx , timberland and a much more expensive shoe - boot by allen edmonds . in most cases , the designs were over the top , making them unsuitable for business casual attire . if you seeking a little extra height or merely just want to avoid puddles , these shoes are worth a look - especially if you are seeking a plain design that represents a muted low - key style . prosthick soleswide widthslight overall shoe weightconsplain drab design ( not split toe or square toe ) 
i bought a 9 . 0 ( d ) size shoe which is my size . i could nor fit my feet in them with any comfort at all ! this is the first time that i bought the northfield oxford from rockport . they also seem cheaply made from the inside to the outside . i had to return them , 
i gave this shoes to my husband for father ' s day and he loves it ! it ' s very comfortable . 
i bought a & # 34 ; black & # 34 ; pair of these shoes at nordstrum where they are 30 % more expensive , and i found this pair to be comfortable from the start . i bought a brown pair of this same shoe through amazon at the cheaper price and found them to be uncomfortable because their inner sole insert was irregular and not flat . i returned them to amazon . 
i was satisfied . good price , good quality . in my country , i should pay much more to get this quality shoes . i usually get 10 ~ 10 . 5 size shoes . but this one is little big for me ( i ordered size 10 ) 
i ' m considering whether or not i should buy a 3rd pair of these . they wear out in about a year , and i do not do a lot of walking . the hole in the heel of the insole develops , and the rubber sole also wears down quickly . if the durability were a better , i would give these shoes 5 stars . 
i got these to go along with the brown northfield ' s i already own . . i can use them for good casual since nobody really dresses up anymore . . do they ? the only issue is my wife who doesn ' t think that lug soles are appropriate , but i ' ll deal with that . . . . good quality leather which for me translates into out - of the - box comfort ! 
originally bought these to wear at dog shows , where one may need to stand in a wet field , while wearing something nicer than jeans and sneakers . these shoes are truly waterproof , and offer good traction on mud , wet tile , and even ice . i ' ve since taken to wearing these shoes on business trips as well . the soft soles contribute to the good traction , at the expense of rapid wear . the brown works best for work . the black looks a little clunky , like a safety shoe . i may pick up a pair of the nubuck , as well . i like these shoes enough that tonight i am ordering a replacement pair here on amazon ( i got the original pair at a discount shoe chain several years ago ) . 
i needed a new pair of shoes to replace the sneakers i always wear . i love these shoes , very comfortable , nice sole , good fit to my foot . i ' m wearing these all the time , since i received them a week ago . after i purchased them , i read some of the reviews , all i can say , for the moment , i ' m happy with them . i ' ll see how they wear in the future . 
this is my third pair of these shoes . i really like that they have different widths in them because i have a wide foot . plus , i have found that amazon ' s price is the same as any of the outlets . 
i got the black ones . these may be the most comfortable shoes iv ' e ever owned . very nice to walk in . aggressive tread design , never slip on the ice or in the mud . when clean these shoes look like dress shoes , though i wear them to clean carpets in . i ' m mot sure if they are waterproof but they are water resistant for sure . m sock have never gotten wet when wearing these shoes . they clean up easily and nicely . great shoes , if you spend a lot of time on your feet you won ' t be disappointed . 
i bought these on sale through amazon for my husband who has worn rockport shoes before and these fit just like all of the other rockport shoes . they are dressy enough to wear with pants and also work well on casual work days with jeans . cannot go wrong in my opinion . 
this shoe comes with rockport ' s supreme comfort and quality . rockport excels at bringing athletic shoe comfort to business and casual shoes . just be aware that this shoe runs short . the shortness is not in the overall length but in the ball of the foot . the natural bending point of the sole was behind the ball of my foot , making extremely uncomfortable at first . i had to return mine and order up a full size larger . also be aware the shoe has a steel shank . 
great shoes for someone on there feet a lot . good price is under $ 80 . nice leather uppers , nice sole and cushioned inside is good . highly recommend . 
it seems like every rockport shoe i buy is an excellent product . comfortable and stylish , i wear them to work with khakis . 
i walk a lot and this shoe was not good for me . i love rockports but the heel of this show is really hard and never loosened up . would not buy again . 
my late father got me into rockport shoes years ago and he was not wrong . they take care of my feet so well that i do not think about them - well made , they last for years and they are as good the last day before i get new ones - does not matter what i use them for or need them , walk , run , climb , sit , they work - i will probably never change . 
i bought these shoes specifically for the yearly expo our organization runs in huge convention halls . last year i thought i took a pair of fairly comformtable shoes with me , but my feet were killing me on the second day . by day four i could barely walk and my feet were covered in blisters . after learning my lesson i was looking specifically for black semi - dressy - looking walking shoes and this model with its dmx feature and host of positive reviews sounded fairly promising . i am back from the expo now and happy to say that i made the right choice . not only my feet did not turn into a bloody pulp by the end of the show , but i was able to explore the orlando in the evenings and even walk entire universal studios the next day after the expo was over . good work rockport . i know which shoes i am taking with me to the expo next year ! 
as with most rockport shoes these are excellent as usual ( some review better then others so do read up when buying ) . wide enough for my feet upon arrival , the only modification i made was to set the laces up as slip on shoes for my own preference . 
i ' ve had the exact shoes and wore them out . i was so surprised to find them again , and at such a great price . highly recommend . 
high quality shoe for a reasonable price . i have black ones for work and white ones to go out . i have big feet ( 13w ) but these shoes do not look big . these shoes have good shock padding but i add extra to eliminate all of my knee pain issues . 
purchased for father and ordered his normal size . his worn this same shoe for 25 years . the fit was totally off and they had to be returned , sadly . guess he will go to an actual store for his next pair . 
i bought this shoe for my dad . he has worn them for years and just loves them . he had a very hard time finding this color and when he did it was $ 70 . he was so happy to find them on amazon at $ 50 . they came fast and as expected . they fit perfect and he ' s very happy . 
contrary to some reviews , these shoes were sized correctly . however , the sole pattern is changed from previous pairs that i have owned . only time will tell how we ' ll they last . my first impression is basically favorable . 
rockports , do you have to say anything else , if you know shoes and are on your feet a lot these are the shoes you want . 
these are the only shoes my husband wears for work . he ' s on his feet quite a bit , and considering the wear they go through , they hold up relatively well . as i said , these are the only shoes he buys for work . 
i gave this rating because i always buy rockports for work . i ' ve just got to find me a smaller size the next time i order some . i always buy the men shoes because the women are so much more expensive . i would most diffently recommend these to a friend . 
my old rockport black walking shoes finally wore out , so i replaced them with a pair of m7100s . i ordered the same size as the old ones and found the new ones fits just the same . the quality of the shoe construction seems good . the shoes were a little & # 34 ; stiff & # 34 ; when i first wore them but after a day of office work they seemed to already be & # 34 ; breaking in & # 34 ; . rockport has always been a good brand to me and i ' ll continue to wear them . 
i always buy rockport and have always been satisfied with high quality shoes . they are long lasting and i can rely that the size is consistent . 
this is my sixth pair of rockport pro walkers . they are the most comfortable shoe . period ! i have them in white , sport white ( which is really light beige ) , and black . they ' re all comfortable . as long as rockport keeps making them , i ' ll keep buying them . the only thing i would change would be to make the arch a little higher . 
i get these ever year or so for my dad . he has always had trouble with his back and feet . since he started wearing rockports many years ago it made a huge difference in how his back and feet felt . he has been in the pro walker for several years . i also like the fact the company makes shoes for for regular and extra wide . if you order just double check the cart for sizing . for example 2e is wide . he is extremely happy with this shoes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i love these shoes they are comfortable and fit as expected , i would recommend these shoes for purchase . . goes well with all most any outfit . . 
my brother lives in a small town in louisiana and never finds shoes that fit well . i took a chance and ordered these and sent just knowing the size he said he wears . he received them on time and really likes them . my one complaint - is that they are called sport white , so named by the makers i guess . when ordering i just looked at the picture and to my mind they were & # 34 ; bone & # 34 ; ( which they are ) . i get my confirmation of order and the shoe is described & # 34 ; sport white & # 34 ; . i think , oh , no , i meant to order beige or bone - - so i try to cancel the & # 34 ; sport white & # 34 ; and order them in bone - - only to discover that bone is called sport white by some color blind rockport ad writer . i am advised by amazon it is too late to cancel ( which means 2nd order was processed in the speed of light ! ) and i ( my brother in leesville ) may refuse delivery on the second package . which he did . but i have yet to hear from amazon about a credit on the second pair . meanwhile , my advice is for someone somewhere to get themselves a color chart . beige / bone is not sport white . and it would be nice to be advised of a credit without having to inquire . 
gave these shoes to my son - in - law and he loves them . . . said they were like he did not have on any shoes they were so comfortable . he just had foot surgery and needs some good comfortable shoes and rockports were the first ones that came to my mind . thanks for a good product and good and prompt service . 
i ' ve been wearing these shoes form many years . i wear them every day . they used to be made in the us , then china and now vietnam . unfortunately when they began manufacturing these shoes in asia the left shoe became slightly tight by my pinky toe . ( i buy the & # 34 ; wide & # 34 ; size . ) i bring the shoe to my local shoe maker . i have the shoe stretched the shoe in that area and then it is fine . by wearing these shoes daily i find that by the end of the third month they have to be replaced . the heal has worn down . this heal on this type of shoe , similar to a sneaker , can not be replaced . 
this has to be one of the most durable man ' s shoe on the market . my husband can be very rough on things , but each pair of these that he has had has outlasted all other brands he has tried . amazon ' s price is great , and we like that it has them since the reebok rockport outlet near us has closed . 
i take a men ' s size 12 , which is what i ordered , and these fit like a size 10 - 10 . 5 on me . the shoes are very well made and look sharp . . . and i ' ve experience with rockport walkers in the recent past . . . so i feel qualified in rating them , and give ' em 4 stars . . . but i cannot fit into these comfortably , hence i ' m taking a star off for poor sizing . i am going to try / buy these locally now since the size seems to be such an issue . . . and donate this pair to our local thrift . 
i used to wear rockports when in sales years ago and , i am glad to find they still make a quality , comfortable shoe . they provide good support and cushioning even for my 225 # body . a good value for the money in my opinion . 
i like these shoes . the service was good and while they are what i wanted , i had to return them because they were not my size . they did not have my color in my size so they promptly gave me my money back . good company . 
the shoe i wear almost always . have been wearing them for at least 18 years , rotating through 10 pairs to give them ample time for them to dry out between wearings . replace a couple pair every year . amazon has a good price . 
i usually buy nike and that was my intent , but amazon ` s selection did not have what i wanted . so i looked to rockport as i have bought them in the past . the only problem i saw was the last time years ago when i bought them last they took a long time to break in . but the price was right and went ahead and bought them . they arrived on time and i planned to spend a long time getting them broken in but low and behold they were comfortable right out of the box ! i like their quality and fit but the one downside is the shoe strings were dirty for some reason , my only complaint . 
not quite as good as the pro walkers i remember from the past . these seem flimsier with much less attention to design . 
i wear these shoes almost every day of the year . they are comfortable and durable . i wear them to work in and for walks each morning of up to 4 miles . the shoes have never hurt my feet with the exception of when the insoles break down , which i then replace . each pair has lasted me 2 - 3 years . i ' m on my fourth pair now . i buy the black model because they don ' t show dirt and are easy to polish with a liquid kiwi polish which keeps them looking nice . mine fit true to size in length but are maybe just a tad bit wide . 
this shoe is not comfortable like running shoe , the sole is hard , and flat , and little heavy . 
these shoes are so very nice . there is solved inside . as well as attractive . my husband has worn them everyday since he ' s had them . well worth the price of 55 dollars . this product is excellent ! 
i have owned some form of this shoe for many years . due to some painful foot issues , there are very few shoes that i can wear comfortably , and these are probably my favorite . i wear these almost every workday and i do a decent amount walking during the day . i wish they would last a little longer . . . i tend to get a new pair every 8 months or so . i find they usually wear out at the top inside of the heel ( achilles notch ) or the rubber starts separating from the sole . since they are not super expensive , i am willing to re - buy them because they are really super comfortable . 
no support to speak of and not all that comfortable . bought some asics to walk in they are lighter and a more comfortable shoe for me to walk in . will not buy another pair of these as they are sitting in my closet . a waste of money for what they advertise as a " pro walker " . 
finding shoes to fit a 8 . 5 3e foot is difficult to say the least . he put these on & wore them the we received them . 
i purchased these shoes 6 / 13 mainly based on their reputation for quality . after 5 months of just average wear they have developed a hole in the side interior of one shoe . needless to say i would not be purchasing this product in the future . 
i ' m writing this for my husband as he is the one that is wearing them , not me . i first had a review fur the first pair he had me order n that is because they aren ' t made in the us any more now in other locations . therefore , the quality could be better n i just have to say you just have to hope the making of these sneakers n shoes will try harder to make them as best as possible ! that ' s all i can relate . 
my husband really likes these shoes . he has trouble finding good shoes in his size and rockport shoes not only fit perfect but look great . 
i love these shoes / sneakers . having owned rockports for dress i was hoping the sneaker version would be of the same quality - - trust me - - they are . these have quickly become my favorite sneaker . 
i have been using rockport walking shoes for about 15 years . this pair replaced a similar pair worn out from several years of use . one reason i have stuck to rockport is the comfort and support . another reason is that size 11eee is often not available from other brands in the style / colors i like . 
came quickly - nice plain show - that comes in wide - my husband likes them . he threw away his old ones when he pulled them out of the box 
i bought these for my security - related job . they are a great fit , are very comfortable , and seem to be quite durable . 
i ' m on my feet 8 to 12 hours a day , and rockports are very comfortable and without a doubt the best shoes for hard working feet . i ' ve tried various different brands , because they were cheaper in cost , but eventually come back to this same shoes . these work well for causal dress and business dress as well . 
outstanding g shoes mouthpiece and quality . i recommend these shoes . outlastallothers perhaps not the most attractive of the lot but a verymasculine shoe 
overall very nice shoe that looks and wears great . good construction , sturdy and supportive ( ish ) . length size ( 15 ) perfect with a spenco 6 orthotic for those of us on our feet a lot . it feels a little wide on the back but perhaps that is just me or the spenco or both ! 
i ' ve been wearing this particular brand of rockport for over ten years . they ' re classy , shiny , comfy and are generally the best pair of shoes for work that i ' ve ever owned . now . . . . . . . that said , they have had " issues " over the years . way back when the soles were simply horrid . the entire sole on one shoe literally split right in half . for a $ 100 . 00 dress shoe that is simply unacceptable . now , flash forward ten years and the sole issue has been resolved but my most recent pair the right inside heel wore out very quickly which resulted in a very sore right heel . other than that ? there aren ' t many shoes that can stand up to a midwest winter but these do . between the rain , sleet , snow , salt on the roads no shoes hold up better than these . i give them my recommendation . 
i bought these to replace similar ones that had worn out . the size is perfect and they are extremely comfortable . there has been no breaking in period . the quality may not be quite as good as i had previously , but i am very happy with them . 4month follow up : after wearing these shoes for a while , they have become increasingly uncomfortable . the crease that has developed over the toes is painful . my toes feel pushed forward due to the . tapering . they are ok , if one only wears them for a few hours . not as good quality as previous similar model that i had used for years . 
i ' ve worn rockport men ' s margin oxford shoes in various colors for many years . i ' m delighted amazon now carries them . this shoe is as comfortable and foot - supporting as your favorite running shoe , but they ' re stylish enough i can wear them to work at the office . when i know appearance is especially critical , i may switch to a more formal - looking shoe , but these are my everyday go - to shoes . fit was perfect . they ' re so comfortable , i wore them to work the next day , right out of the box , no break - in necessary . highly recommended ! 
i actually had to return this shoe as it was cut a bit too small for my foot . however , it looked good and was comfortable . a half size up should do well for me . 
very comfortable shoes and good for day to day work . and also it ' s very thick that good for wearing in the winter 
i have owned 3 pairs of these because i wear them out . they are durable shoes though . i ruin all my shoes . . i remember when people said doc martens were indestructible and i destroyed those as well back in high school . these shoes fit great . i have very wide big feet 5e . these don ' t look super expensive , but they are nice looking casual shoes . give them a shot . the price ranges from around 60 to 90 . price shop them . 
these were a little dressier than what i was looking for , no complaint otherwise . i just wanted something i could wear with jeans or khakis , these are more khaki / slack / suit style in my opinion . 
i love this shoes , it is worth the money i spent on them , even though the style is like a classic , s ' thing that i wasn ' t looking for , th quality is just awesome . 
the back of right shoe is very tight . it was really painful for the beginning . however , after about 5 days , it gets better . decent shoes for work . 
although i personally prefer the ( now - discontinued ) jefferson and washington models from dockers ( which were very similar to these rockports in design and style but more comfortable ) i ' ll admit that these are excellent . they have a simultaneously casual and dress - casual styling and aura and go well with both khaki pants and jeans . as with most rockport shoes the overall quality of both craftsmanship and built is excellent . 
i got my boyfriend two pair of these in black , they are the only shoes he will wear . fits great , feels great , and lasts long . 
classic brown dress shoes are becoming increasingly hard to find ( as well as mens ' brown pants - - khaki yes , brown no ) . thank heavens rockport carries traditional styles in many colors - - just one reason the company has so many loyal customers . these shoes are well - made , comfortable and look nice . everything you could want in a shoe . update : two months after buying these shoes , the rubber sole on one shoe ( in toe area ) separated from the leather . we returned them to rockport , and they are replacing them at no charge . the whole process took several weeks . rockport makes a determination whether to replace - - that takes about a week , and shipping out takes about another week . we were disappointed the shoe split , but we also appreciate a company that stands behind its product . 
i really like these shoes . they look great with jeans or khakis , and will last a long time if they are anything like my past rockports . 
these shoes fit true to size and are very comfortable . i recommend them to anyone looking for a good - looking , comfortable dress casual shoe . 
my husband picked these shoes out on line when he couldn ' t find a similar shoe in catalogs or in the stores . i then did an internet search for the best price . oh how i love to shop on line ! we received them really fast and my husband loves the shoes . they were comfortable from day one which is what you want a shoe to be . 
i work in an office and thus need to wear a basic black shoe from monday through thursday every week . being a frugal guy i try to never spend more than about $ 50 on a pair of shoes for work . however i was also looking for something comfortable and durable , which will bend and flex with my foot rather than just being stiff . these shoes fit the bill perfectly at a price i could handle . i tried them on in a store first to see how they ' d fit and then ordered from amazon where they were about $ 25 cheaper ( hitting my $ 50 limit ) . i have a 9 . 5 very average ( d - width ) foot and i took a size 9 d in these . i ' ve been wearing them a little over a month and they are very comfortable and aren ' t scuffing up too quickly . time will tell how durable these are but for $ 50 if i get a couple years out of them i think they ' re still a good value . recommended . 
i have several pairs of these shoes and they are great . they have held up well and give me the additional support i need due to a bad ankle . 
very comfortable , will definate rebuy these . . . but they are not wearing out . . . tough shoe . . . great in the snow . . . perfect for dress and casual wear . update : now , after 2 . 5 years of wear , i am just now buying a new pair , the sole and upper leather still look great , but the insole wore out , i tried to replace the insole 2 months ago , but they have never had the same comfort . . . . is well worth a re - buy , wear these shoes everyday for work in a business casual setting . . 
i got this in a 9 . 5 and returned it as the size was a little large . i got a half size smaller and it fits great . 
even though my feet aren ' t wide ( that ' s what shoe salespeople tell me ) , i bought the ' w ' size and i ' m very pleased with the fit . the shoes are very comfortable and i didn ' t have to break them in . i bought the nubuck ( looks like brushed leather ) which gives them a more casual look and the shoes can be worn with jeans , khakis or just about anything but a 3 piece suit . sometimes i want to go out with jeans but don ' t want to look like a slob with sneakers and these shoes are perfect . 
i used to buy rockport shoes exclusively but not anymore . when these shoes were made in the united states they were some of the best shoes around . not anymore . its a shame , shame , shame . 
these rockport shoes are absolutely totally comfortable right out of the box . then again that just about says it all for rockport ' s products 
this is about my fourth pair of rockport oxfords . they last about 1 . 5 years , wearing them two to three days a week ( i alternate a chocolate and a black pair ) . they ' re the most comfortable semi - dress shoes that i ' ve found . i sometimes take several mile walks in them in downtown honolulu , and they don ' t hurt my feet ! 
liked them so much that i bought several in other colors . it fits perfect and not like today ' s pants that have no & # 34 ; butt & # 34 ; or very low ride on the hip ( hate that look ) . the quality is great . 
my husband only wears the wrangler carpenter fit jeans . he loves them . and if he is happy i am happy . they are a great fit and a great price . 
stores rarely have this waist size and shopping for jeans in the boys department will get you a wrangler size 16 , which should be 28 x 31 , but does not fit the same as a men ' s jean . suck it up , don ' t tuck in your shirt and you are going to look like a twig in jeans made for little boys . a wrangler size 18 is impossible to find in the stores , but that would compare to a 29 x 31 . an alternative would be the husky sizes which should be a 30 " waist for a size 16h ; too big and the pockets get bigger too . with these jeans , i have fit with a comfortable waist , heavy material that is washed out enough to be softer . these are the same carpenter ' s jeans found in the discount stores . these will look nice for a couple of years with heavy wear . 
jeans have always posed a problem for me . i have always had big thighs . for this reason , most jeans that fit my waist usually strangled my upper legs . i was never a real big fan of jeans for this reason until i was given my first pair of wrangler carpenter fit jeans . before getting them , i would always try to find the baggiest jeans i could for comfort ' s sake . these carpenter jeans , however , are just right for me . not only do they feature standard jean pockets , they also feature a hammer loop on one side and two side pockets on the other . these pockets are perfect for needlenose pliers , crescent wrenches , screwdrivers or just about any small hand tool . they are also perfect for cellphones when you ' re not at work . they are also extremely durable . i ' ve had a few pairs last me for a couple of years before i quit wearing them to work . i usually have three pairs of these jeans in my closet . i wear each pair once and on wednesday , wash all of them and wear two of them again to finish off the week . the jeans have a very baggy fit to them and leave plenty of breathing room for my thighs . on most weekends , i primarily wear shorts everywhere i go . if i don ' t wear shorts , i have on a pair of these jeans . highly recommended for their toughness and comfort . as stated in the title of this review , these are my favorite jeans . i mean that completely ! 
well this fits me well , already made clothes are difficult to please , some no qualms about this , take or leave it 
i believe wrangler has a better fit than levis nowadays and an affordable price . these pants just fit fantastically . i owned a pair prior to these but waist expansion has made the previous pair fit funny , ; ) . these seem like a well made pair of jeans and i do enjoy wearing them for their comfort . they arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date and were well packaged . if this waist problem persist i do hope it is a reduction vice an expansion either way i am keeping the old pair just in case they might one day fit again . i recommend this product . 
wrangler is a top grand . bought this as a gift and haven ' t heard any feedback yet but wrangler has the best quality and fit . 
i have high arches and wear orthodics in my shoes for extra support . i also have a little bit of foot pain from plantar fasciitis , which i control by wearing shoes with orthodics . the problem is , when i wake up in the morning ( or am hanging around the house ) i don ' t want to put on ' real shoes ' - i just want to slip something on so that i don ' t have to walk around barefoot ( which hurts after a bit ) . birkenstock only has two models with high arches - this one ( boston ) and the arizona . both in taupe suede . i bought both . let ' s face it , they are not the most attractive shoes . . . but i think the boston looks better than the arizona when wearing pants / jeans . however , in the summertime , when it is hot - your feet will sweat in the boston ! so i bought the arizona for hot days / shorts and the boston for cool days / pants . again , they are not stylish or attractive , but they are comfortable . and they will get more comfortable with age . as you wear them they will mold around your feet , making them even more comfortable . regarding sizing : the suede stretches . i have been wearing birkenstocks on and off for 20 years . and the suede stretches more than the leather . but the suede is definitely more comfortable . so be prepared , as it stretches , to add a hole or two to make them tighter ( i use an ice pick , knife or scissors to make additional holes ) . ( you will know it has stretched when your toes start to hit the front of the shoe . ) with other shoes i opt to get the shoe a bit bigger for comfort ( especially to give room for my orthodics ) , but with this shoe i go true - to - size . ( e . g . , with other shoes i wear a women ' s 9 . 5 , but with this shoe i wear a 39 narrow ) . lastly - i am not sure if it is always the case , but when i bought them they were cheaper here on amazon than they were on the birkenstock website ! yay for comfortable shoes ! : ) 
i absolutely love my new birkinstock black suede bostons . they are the most comfortable shoes that i have ever worn . since i have arthritis in my feet , they are the only shoes i can wear now . thanks for a great product ! ! 
this is the epitome of comfort and coolness . it is easy put it in in out , it is stylish and the workmanship is impeccable . 
i own 23 pairs of birkenstocks ( sandals and clogs ) . i always get either leather or suede . the shoes fit true to size . i get size 11m or 42 for sandals and size 43 in clogs so that i can wear heavy socks with them for winter . i can also wear the 11m clogs with a reg . pair of socks . they hold up very well . my oldest pair is about 30 years old . i have had them resold once . great value . 
i tried these on in a local store and they had the appropriate high arch . but these ones had no arch . i sent them back and was very disappointed . 
i got these in steel gray . they are so comfortable . i have several pairs of birkenstocks . 
i was sad when i got these because they were way too big , even though i got them in a 37 narrow . i was hoping with the high arch they would fit better , the length is correct , but still too wide , and not able to adjust the buckle any smaller to make them fit correctly . i thought the high arch was going to make a difference but i don ' ; t believe this particular pair had any higher arch than any of my other birkenstocks . i once owned these years back when i was an rn , in white , and they fit great , right out of the box in a 37 narrow , with just a regular arch . maybe different colors run different sizes ? too bad because i loved them then , and i was able to wear them at work without any breaking in time . 
the birkenstock boston clog , aubergine , is one of the most beautiful birkenstock shoe of the more than 30 pairs i have . i recommend this shoe to any one who wants beauty , comfort and value . 
i have several pairs of birkenstock sandals and love them . birkenstocks tend to be durable and high caliber . to make a good thing even better still , you get a ready - made , built - in arch in birkenstocks . however , for those who do need orthotics , you can wear these without and still get good arch support . they are also extremely comfortable . these shoes are ideal for long walks and are very attractive . as another reviewer on the amazon us boards pointed out , these shoes do come in european sizes , so it is important to know what size you wear . i like the heel or backstrap as it provides extra support . birkenstocks meet just about every foot / walking need . i find these shoes a godsend and of extraordinary caliber . they do tend to be expensive , but they are worth it . birkenstocks will meld to your feet and once your food leaves its impression , you will walk with comforot . if you order online , you have a wider price range . 
i received these shoes the other day , and they ' re great , but i ' m writing to encourage others to be sure to adjust the straps carefully and take a few minutes to flex the sole by hand before deciding they ' re not for you . strangely enough , even though the size is a perfect fit , i found that the strap adjustments are not intuitive at all . generally speaking , i have a wide foot ( 10w ) and have to cinch the ankle and widen at the toes . not so with these ! i actually had to cinch a good bit at the toe , loosen the front of the ankle as far as it would go , and then cinch again just a bit at the backstrap . but having done so , it ' s a perfect fit . the other thing i did , upon finding that the footbed is really , really hard and stiff , was to google " how to break in birkenstocks " and found that a number of people advise manually flexing the footbed with their hands a few times . i did that , though perhaps not as gently as suggested , and it helped a lot with comfort . if you ' re as new to birkenstocks as i am , try these things before you send them back . you ' ll be glad you did ! * * * also , a note on color : i ordered and received the cocoa nubuck , but it is not a red brown as pictured , just a regular old brown . kind of disappointing after seeing the lovely rich reddish brown color in the picture . . . but not disappointing enough to send them back . though if i had bought them for color alone , they would indeed be winging their way back to amazon right now . just so you know . february 5 , 2013 - - updated to add : i really found the color blah and boring , as i mentioned above , and the more i looked at them the more i hated them , actually . but $ 3 . 00 and a bottle of angelus suede dye later , they ' re an absolutely gorgeous rich deep red . i also added some cheap copper bling from the beading section at walmart to match the buckles , and now you ' d never know how plain and blah they once were . one hint : if you ' ve never dyed suede , google it thoroughly before you try . it ' s very easy but there are definitely tricks to it , and if you don ' t wear gloves and you don ' t tape off the cork , you will have a permanently ruined shoe . follow the instructions to the letter , from people who have done it , and you ' ll be amazed at the results . i was ! ! ! 
i enjoyed wearing my birkenstock milano sandals . i wore my heel of the sandals down in just a few months ; so i stopped wearing them thinking of getting them repaired ; but i did not . i found these sandals comfortable as they form fit to one ' s feet . i liked the cork and latex foot bed so much that i have bought a pair of mephisto shark sandals instead of another pair of milano . the milano are about a 1 / 3 of the cost of the shark ; so the milano may be a good deal . 
i own a few different birkies and all i can say is that they fit great , give excellent support and are well built . wear a pair of these and your feet will thank you . 
i ' m going to several countries in europe and hope to wear my birkies with heavy wool socks . i ' ll tell you more after i ' ve worn them . 
needs shoe stretcher to get them to fit . the sizing stated europe ' s 44 for 11 - 11 . 5 men ' s usi believe 45 would have been closer to us ' s 11 - 11 . 5quality looks okay but not sure it ' s worth $ 102 
this is a typically fabulous birkenstock shoe . it ' s easy to slip on and adjust the straps . i just had foot surgery , so these soles really are helping get my feet back into tip top shape . i love how the footbed supports my arches , toes and where my bunion used to be . i have an & # 34 ; inside & # 34 ; pair and an & # 34 ; outside & # 34 ; pair and i highly recommend these for anyone experiencing any foot problems . 
i bought these after a recommendation from my cousin and i have found them to be very comfortable and sturdy . 
i love these shoes , but i had to wear down the bumps in the padding to get them to fit just right and get the back straps set to hold my feet in just the right place . it took about one week of continuous wear to get feeling great . the straps , being leather are stiff which means i had some blisters . i took to wearing socklets and that works for me . plus i get them less dirty . i do not want to wear when it is wet or muddy . they do & # 34 ; grip & # 34 ; the ground lots better than my other sandals . however , the gaps in the bottom of the soles picks up pecan pieces from the driveway . the squirrels are busy this year , lol . 
this is my second pair of birkenstock milano ' s , i just love the footbed , the fit is great ( i am a narrow and they work great for me ) , i expect these to last as long as the previous pair and i will again get birkenstock . 
these are uncomfortable and i recommend thinking twice if you have shaggy or long hair as the ear pieces tend to get tangled into your hair . product appears well constructed but this is a case where & # 34 ; i would not have bought if i tried them on first & # 34 ; because they just aren ' t for me . 
bought these for my husband at his request . he needed something to help with the brightness of the sun but not make things too dim . tried them out this past weekend . he loves them . will buy an extra pair . 
i ' ve had real ray - bans with the wrap around earpieces and they were not uncomfortable like this . also , they scratch very easily and the marks are very noticeable on the mirror lens . i would not recommend these glasses . spend a little more and get a quality product . 
i think they ' re just fine for my usage . especially with the wrap - around earpiece . i just really love them . quite probably willbe a repeat buyer 
these are really nice glasses if you are on a motorcycle or in a bass boat . they grip around the ears and they are not falling off . nice dark tint for those really bright days . these the glasses i wear when i ' m on the bike or flying down the lake in the bass boat . 
lenses are big and arms are not long enough ; so , glasses fit very tight around the ears . sure wish they had one size fits all . those wrap around the ear arms are the worst 
for an aftermarket product , these have lasted a long time , very durable and comfortablegood price , can ' t argue about the quality ; lasting longer than some that have cost $ 100 
i absolutely love the smoke lenses us air force style aviator sunglasses ! the fit is perfect and they will not slide off when you bend over . i bought one pair to start with and liked them so much i bought a spare pair and six more for gifts . comes with military style case . 
the glasses are just what i was looking for with cable temple hooks . i wanted to use these when i was out on a boat fishing for marlin and these do the job admirably . 
i love these underwear . true to fit . no panty line , extremely comfortable . i ' ve bought them before and will continue to buy these all the time . you don ' t have to buy them that often . they really do last through hundreds of washings . i put them in the dryer on delicate . these are my favorite by far . 
i probably bought too large a size but they came up way higher than pictured . the photo was just where i wanted them . but bought them mainly for travel and they are light weight and from the material assume they will dry fairly quickly after hand washing . so good for me . just not perfect . 
no panty lines , do not ride up , no bulges high or low . i have tried other brands but always go back to these for total comfort . they are both functional and a bit sexy so no reason not to love . 
these are waaaay to big . model makes them appear sexy with the lace touch , but these panties are huge . i usually wear a five or six and i don ' t think a 3 wouldhave worked . to much fabric . 
these are light , pretty , take up little space in the drawer , and stay in place ! no ride up ! love them . 
i purchased medium ( listed as women ' s 6 . 5 - 7 . 5 medium ) for my mom . the slipper footbed must be about a size 8 . and the top was too short to velcro shut for my mom who wears size 6 . 5 wide , and barely shut for me who wears size 8 medium . really disappointed , since most of the reviews were so good . ah , well . 
these are very comfy and cushy ; however , my feet tend to want to slide inside ( and my feet aren ' t dried out or sweaty ) . i attribute it to the material . 
i love these slippers ! ! ! i recently had surgery on my foot and these slippers are exactly what i needed after getting out of the post op shoe and gigantic dressing . they can be adjusted with velcro across the top to make snug enough for secure footing and accommodate swelling . the footbed is soft and supportive and the sole is safe and sturdy ! where have you been all my lifeacorn women ' s new spa slide slipper powder blue , large med , ( 8 - 9 m us ) ? ? ? ? ahhhhh : - ) i would recommend these for anyone regardless of surgery or not . 
this is my third pair of acorn slippers and i will never buy another brand . you just can ' t beat them for comfort and durability . somehow they manage to give good support and yet be supremely comfortable . and the memory foam in the bed cushion really holds up - - for several years . a great investment . 
been wearing " secret sole " by isotoner for several years because i have plantar faciitis and have to have the foot support . however , newer isotoner styles are too narrow , the old style is discontinued , and some of the new styles don ' t have the mid - foot support . researched a bunch and tried the acorn . love them except for one pretty big issue . the velcro closure is based on a hard plastic type of base - - probably so the stitching will be more secure and stay for a long time . problem is the raw edge of the plastic has to end past the stitch line , creating a thin line of roughness . that plastic rubs against the top of my foot , just left of the center , near the toes . i tried to cut it back a little , but it still rubs . doesn ' t rub a red spot or a blister , just irritates . maybe i ' ll try a fabric tape next . only thing with that is that they won ' t be adjustable since i ' ll have to tape over the place where the velcro overlaps . i have the same problem with the tags in night gowns . i suppose companies use that horrid plastic thread so that their brand name will always be in the gown - - well after the material has worn out ! maybe i just have very sensitive skin or nerve endings . : - ) anyway , i have mixed feelings about purchasing the acorn again . they ' re double the price and aren ' t truly comfortable . i just don ' t know where to turn next in my research for a great pair of bedroom slippers that address my foot problems . 
i have bursitis in my heels , and these are a lifesaver . i ' m a ladies size 7 shoe , but i find the large ( 8 - 9 ) in these slippers are most comfortable . i have about 4 pairs , as does my mom . 
bought this for older family member who has a long foot and always wears socks . i prefer the acorn spa wrap slipper but with her long foot and thick socks she always felt like the back was pinching her ankle . she says this one is just as pillowy soft but with an open back . 
good fit . true to size . cushioned . top is velcro so you can adjust the fit . rubber sole good if you have to go outside . i love all acorn slippers . 
these slippers are soft with great cushion support . i would certainly recommend these to anyone . since the slipper velco adjusts to fit , they can fit a wide variety of foot widths . they ' re great ! 
i ' m not a big fan of completely covering my foot with a slipper but i don ' t like the thing between my toes , so these work out perfectly for me . 
these are the best , most comfy after - work / gym slippers ever . they conform to your feet and feel sooooooooooooooo good after a hard day . i like that they have an open toe for the summer . i have medium - to - narrow feet and these fit perfectly b / c of the adjustable velcro strap . they adjust to much bigger , but if you have big / wide / water - retention feet , i imagine these might not fit . they ' re really light on your feet - not heavy at all . i wish i could wear them 24 / 7 ! ! they feel that good ! 
acorn women ' s new spa slide slipper natural , xlarge med , ( 9 . 5 - 10 . 5 m us ) i ' ve had several pairs of these . this pair is a little big but wearable . so very soft . excellent price for these on amazon . 
a gift to my daughter . she really loves them . acorn makes a very good comfortable slipper and a nice price . 
have only worn these two weeks , but so far the foam inside is very comfortable . i do wish , however , that the velcro area was a little larger . i am hoping that these will last a long time , for this kind of money . 
they ' re not the lightest nor ergonomic glasses you ' ll try , but for the price you can ' t beat these especially with the polarization . 
very comfortable ! they fit me very well . even wile riding my motorcycle they keep most of the air out . awesome ! 
price wasn ' t that much better than others at stores , but i got the style i wanted , the color i wanted , and time will tell how durable they are . i ' d say these are & # 34 ; more polarized & # 34 ; if that ' s possible , than the ones i ' ve bought cheap at places like academy . these fit great , and they are definitely polarized , as looking at my lcd monitor from different angles and heights reveals quite handily . 
as some have mentioned , these glasses are pretty dang good for the price . the lenses are surprisingly good considering the money . i will say they are not meant for anyone with a face or head that is anything considered big . . . or even somewhat large . i have a pretty average sized face , and these are as small of frames as i would ever buy . if you like compact frames , these are for you , even if you don ' t have a small face . i bought these as a " low risk " set of glasses for times when i won ' t really care if they fall in the river , or get a bad scratch . but compared to my oakley straight jackets and oakley pit bulls , these are a smidge snug . but that ' s ok . . . can ' t expect awesome for this cost . 
he loves this glasses . he uses them all the time and it impressed with them when he was fishing he could see very well into the water below . 
i am happy with this purchase . i replaced a pair of $ 200 sunglasses with these , and while they are not nearly as nice as the previous glasses , they do the job at a much better price . 
i know it is nota very expensive sunglasses , but i think it is very ordinary . i am talking about quality . shipping was fast 
stylish low cost glasses i bought for a friend of mine . these are polarized as said in ad and they offer great coverage and sun protection . 
i got these for my husband who usually breaks his sun glasses . he ' s had them for about 6 months now and hasn ' t broken them . he says he loves them and they are very lightweight and comfortable . and i must say , the look really good on him too . 
decent and ok pair of polarized sunglasses . needed a relatively cheap pair of polarized sunglasses for wearing on the water and for camping . these are comfortable to wear , light , and look good to me . they have been durable and subjected to rough treatment . they have stood up well and perform as you would expect . the lenses have not scratched yet and are great at blocking glare and allowing me to see below the water surface . the price is right too . especially on sale . 
i like the look of these on me , sleek & thin . i wear a 7 3 / 8 & # 34 ; hat so my head is good size and these fit just fine . they aren ' t very dark and let a lot of light in on a brite day . they should make good driving glasses for a semi cloudy day . not dark enough for me . 
an excellent pair of lenses ! ! light weight , excellent fit . . when i have them they seem as i have nothing on . the vision is excellent . 
i cycle 15mi round trip to and from work . i ' m using these as cycling glasses . inexpensive , well made , good tint and polarization . i like them a lot . they do not look like $ 200 glasses , that ' s okay . glasses are failry large . i ' m 6 ' 3 " and they fit well . the frame is fairly beefy and sits against the eyebrows . the lens sits in front of the frame and is vented . this prevents fogging and prevents sweat and such getting on the lens as easily . it does not provide as good wind protection as closer - fitting glasses , but i have not found it objecitonable . it is the best overall balance i have found betwene protection and ventilation . minor complaint is the frame is bulky enough it slightly obscures the top line of vision . this is not objectionable in normal use , but when crouched in riding position , looking through the top of the glasses , is a bit more noticeable . great buy , highly recommended . i will get a set in clear for night riding as well . 
very good glasses ! perfect for sunny and for normal weather . polarized lenses ideal protection from the sun . i like it very much . ideal for hiking . 
these are comfortable and for the price work great . certainly helps reduce the glare and with spotting fish in pools or rapids 
no padding inside box . just the sunglasses and a lot of box to tumble against asinine packaging ! sunglasses were very warped and could not be bent back into shape . 
these glasses arrived on time and in excellent condition . i thought that they would help with glare from oncoming traffic but they do not . however , they are good on cloudy , rainy , foggy or hazy days so i decided to keep them . i don ' t fish so i have no idea how they are for catching the big ones . 
i use these while driving in texas with the bright sun ! i can still see my radio and my cell phone screen through the lens , which i couldn ' t do on my previous glasses because they were too dark . these glasses are actually made quite sturdy , and it doesn ' t look like they will break anytime soon . 
i find these to be perfect . they are polarized , and enhance visibility while driving . exactly what i wanted . polarized style blu blockers . 
i bought these for running , i need sunglasses that won ' t budge or slip and i wear them all the time . the price was so good that i thought i ' d chance it and they are perfect . they are not particularly cool looking , not bad either . the polarization is good , they are lightweight and don ' t budge while i run . there is enough room from side to side and between eye and lens that they keep fog free , very nice for full or large faces . i would buy this same pair again if and when i lose this pair . the mirror lens , which i bought , is very low key . it ' s not that super flash mirror , they seem to be a medium darkness too . perfect for running or exercise in low light . 
recently bought 5 pairs of sunglasses under $ 20 ; sunglasses i would not be afraid misplacing . 2 of the 5 were this style ; one with a yellow lens and one with a smoked lens . they are large . i have a big fat face so they fit me perfectly . they are comfortable . plus they are polarized ! 
these shades are great for cycling on a cloudy day . they are light , fit snugly , and give off an amber color so they do provide a little shading while protecting your eyes from the wind , especially on a cold day . my only complaint about the product is that these are actually quite big and i ' ve got a large head but that is just me being picky . aside from that , these are a good pair of affordable sunglasses that i would highly recommend . 
i ordered these sunglasses for my husband and he seems to love them . he wears them every day . he ' s had them for several months now and they ' re holding up really well . he likes the amber lenses and the style so i am pleased with my purchase . 
got these for my 81 year old dad ( for father ' s day ) to use when he goes fishing . he claims he can never have enough sunglasses for fishing . they fit him perfectly and he is a fairly big man ( 230 lbs ) but i had my husband try on as well and he is a medium size man ( 185 lbs ) and they fit him as well . so what i ' m saying is they are not too small as i ' ve read in other reviews about some sunglasses purchased on line ( to customers dismay ) . they are good looking glasses and i ' d say a good buy for the money . these are not your high end glasses obviously , but for someone who doesn ' t want to make a big investment because they might just end up in a fishes stomach , they are perfect . 
i bought these because they were polarized and cheap ! i don ' t like to pay an arm and a leg for sunglasses and these have done what i need them to do by cutting the glare and being uv safe . 
this is certainly a great buy , it ' s cheap , and very good material , i personally like the looks . and it never slips off so it ' s very good for doing sports , i often wear it for running . 
these are great . buy multiple pairs . . . pros : comfortable , lightweight , suit wide head , lenses outperform glasses worth ten times the pricecons : not very stylish 
love these sun glasses , yellow / amber color is great , polarization is great . they are light weight and easy to clean . 
i bought the yellow lense version and they are great for biking at dusk and they fit my big fat head nicely . the lenses however are quite large . . . too large , in my opinion . other than that , they seem pretty sturdy and the clarity it great . these would also be great for driving but get the dark lenses for bright sunshine protection . 
i have a big head , and a lot of glasses feel tight at my temples . these do not . ( i wear a 7 and 7 / 8 hat ) though i have never had amber lenses , these aren ' t too distracting . i normally buy darker glasses because i ' m fairly photosensitive , but i ' ve been riding my bike a lot and there are a lot of transitions from bright areas to places where there ' s a lot of shade on the local trails . these areas in the shade are too dark with the darker glasses , but fine with the amber . the only drawback is that they do feel a little flimsy . the lenses are anchored to the glasses only at the nose and the temple . the hang separated from the frame over the eyebrow . that may cause a problem , but for the price , they ' re easily replaceable . 
can ' t be beaten for the price . makes seeing into windows , water and stuff that reflects so much easier . frame isn ' t as flimsy as i was fearing and while they aren ' t exactly stylish i was also fearing they would look worse . 
i have been relying heavily on the reviews of others , and start with the best reviews and work my way done until i find a nice balance of positive reviews / price / features . this is a case in point . these were far beyond what i expected to pay for quality eyewear . the style compliments my bald head , and looking through them makes colors seem more robust ! my daughter even took to them . great buy ! 
these are extremely lightweight . while some may find this attractive , i do not . they are exactly as advertised , and reasonable for the money . 
i bought a pair of these last year and liked them so much i got another pair . they are polarized , stylish and a bit big so not mashing my temples . the prices of these are reasonable and they arrived quickly . i would reccomend them for men and women . 
my head is absurdly wide ( ~ 7 & # 34 ; ) . so , buying sunglasses is a pain . most sunglasses pinch my head far too much to be comfortable . these sunglasses stretch to accommodate my head perfectly without pain . that alone makes them worth it . the polarized lenses is also useful . when i ' m driving at 60ish miles per hour , i would like to be able to focus as much as possible . since the lenses are curved , you get ( effectively ) all - around protection from the sun . traditional sunglasses are worthless if the sun is to your left or right since the sunlight can easily reflect off of the inside of the lens . i ' ll admit i ' ve accidentally sat on these sunglasses a couple times . they came perfectly fine , which proves their durability . 
my head is average but this fits a bit big . it ' s comfortable though . they claim it ' s polarized but i don not get that impression . 
the polarized lenses are nice , but the glasses are too big for my face . will be giving them away . . . . probably great glasses for guys though . 
for a relatively inexpensive pair of glasses , these have good sized and good quality lenses . the frame feels solid and stays in place regardless of what i am doing . 
bought these for my husband to supplement his expensive pair of maui jim glasses . he loves them . says they are very lightweight , no pressure on his head , and shade his eyes in direct sunlight . the lenses sometimes come up when he cleans them , but they pop right back in . they are made well and very sturdy . so worth the money , would buy again for sure . 
these glasses are great for the price . they replaced a $ 130 pair of ray - bans , the lens are just as good as the ray - bans . the frames aren ' t as nice as the ray - bans but for the money these sunglasses are a much better deal . 
these are very lightweight . the center nose piece blocks a portion of my view . the center nose support is so large that you see it when wearing the sunglasses . 
i bought this for one reason : to look cool . ok , not that . i bought it to see fish . and it works perfectly for that . really great polorizability . to prove it , i can say my iphone screen is completely versicolored while wearing these . also , the yellow color is great for low - light conditions and protects a bit in the sun as well . definitely does the job for me . i wear them every time i fish . 
i got these sun glasses for simply driving around and considering the price they work great . don ' t waste your money buying more expensive ones . 
bought these for my son . he wears them all the time due to his job is outside . very comfortable and does not slip . 
i purchased these for my father after eye surgery . he loves that he can see the fish now , and they were perfect to wear for protection while he was healing ! 
i had a very similar pair of sunglasses that i paid more than double this price for , and the two are nearly identical . this pair might actually be better , in fact . i wear these for driving , and playing golf , and they are light and comfortable . i wanted a bigger lens to cover some of my peripheral vision and these do the trick . they did come with some silly - looking logo tags snapped to the sides , but they were easily snapped off . i think the brand tags are interchangeable , they come from the factory with holes in the frame , so that the label pieces can be stuck in . i prefer the frames all black with no markings . i ' m satisfied with the value for this price point . i tend to lose my sunglasses periodically and if i do lose these , it won ' t break the bank , but i don ' t want to lose them as they have been a good and serviceable replacement to my last & # 34 ; favorite pair & # 34 ; that i lost . 
i wear 32x32 jeans , which i bought . but they ' re too baggy in the thigh and seat for me . i don ' t want skinny jeans , but these have almost a relaxed character . the color is very dark , the fabric quite soft . well made . 
the jeans are not what i expected they do not fit good at all 
solid jean for the price . my only problem is the belt loops . i ripped one out in two weeks . the biggest problem with these jeans is the competitive options . you can buy carhartt jeans for less money and they are better quality . carhartts fit a little differently but well . 
gracias , buen producto , entrega sin inconvenientes , nos gusto mucho , buena tela y no desti & ntilde ; e , mi esposo encantado , muchas gracias ! 
this was a xmas present for my husband , he loves these jeans , he told me they are the most comfortable jeans he ' s ever had so with that said go get a pair . didn ' t have any problems with delivery or packaging , he was satisfied with the fit and quality , i recommend 
i bought three jeans from you . the first one was very good but the last two , the loops are off and that over a period of two months from the day ireceived them . i can not give a good rating because the product was perverted . sorry . and sorry for my english too . 
i bought these for my husband who has only worn levis 501 for the last 40 + years . he was sceptical but agreed to try a pair since his size is difficult to find in levis sometimes . he was very pleased . they fit nice , feel soft but still have substantial heft and wear and the color is just right . he reports that they are more comfortable than his levis and gave a thumbs up to buying more . 
all my life i have thought of wrangler as being levi ' s main competitor for durability and quality construction . these jeans end that image of wrangler in my mind . dollar store specials would be more appropriate . 
these are my favorite brand of jeans . firstly , they are very well made ; thick rugged denim , good zippers , pocket stitching , etc . secondly , the fit for the " regular fit " jean is quite good . room in the places that you need it while retaining a snappy styling . the length tends to be on the long side , so watch for that . be advised that the " regular fit " jeans differ greatly from the " classic fit " jeans . the " classic fit " jeans are for guys who are pretty darned thin ; i am thinking seventeen year old types . if the " regular fit " fits you right , as it does me , the " classic fit " will be too confining . on the other hand , the " regular fits " are good for grown men of average build who are not unusually skinny . rjb . 
this are used on a daily basis as my husband uniforms so they came to very good use almost immediately . 
these jeans are well made . . they are of a lighter weight denim then other wrangler mens jeans . yet the cut is good . and the stitching is strong . . they wear well . and for a guy like myself whom has diabeties . my weight bounches up and down like a yo yo . these jeans still make you feel comfortable . and are a good looking pair of jeans . they are tapered cut at the cuff . . so they will fit over boots . they do not sag . nor do they make you appear as though your carrying your laundry in the back of your pants . no saggingno dragging . no bagging . they are a good pair of mens jeans . at a good price . as is all of wranglers pants . i prefer them over the other brand . because after months of continued washing ? they dont frey around the cuffs or the pockets tops . they are a five pocket jean as well . bought here , on amazon . com where the whole world shops for value . . . . 
he gets these every year for christmas , so much easier to shop online than deal with crowded malls . good quality and great price ! 
this trousers size too large ! it doesn ' t fit ! this trousers size too large ! it doesn ' t fit ! this trousers size too large ! it doesn ' t fit ! this trousers size too large ! it doesn ' t fit 
i just threw away these pants that i bought 6 months ago . the black faded to a dark grey , with lighter grey wear around the edges . the fade would look fashionable for jeans , but not for dress pants . next time i will stay away from cotton for dress pants and stick to the synthetics , or washable synthetic wool blends . those other materials hold their deep black color nicely for years . 
these are no - iron , comfortable , lightweight and nice looking . what ' s not to like ? these are the second pair i ' ve ordered because i liked the first pair so much . 
i bought these to expanded the number of work pants i have . the quality is great , and i feel comfortable every time i wear them . are they the highest quality pants ? no , but i can dress professionally without worrying the pants will rip or look too casual . 
these pants are very comfortable . they fit well with a clean look and are not too baggy or too tight . minimal ironing is typically all that is needed . moreover , they are far more durable than , say , the pumice beigeizod men ' s american chino flat front metrix fit pant ) ( but not as durable other izod colors ) . and , in the end , it ' s a good price for business casual pants . 
these pants are good quality and wearable . they come in great colors and always fit . can be used for dress or casual . 
this is my second pair of birkenstocks and this style is very flattering and comfortable . this is an excellent shoe and the price at amazon was wonderful . very pleased with this purchase . 
these were less comfortable for me than cheap plastic flip flops . the part hat goes between your toes is really large and uncomfortable . the base is really hard , no cushion at all . the & # 34 ; bronze & # 34 ; straps also looked plasticy in person . returned . 
i got these sandals last year and never wore anything else the rest of the summer . soooo comfortable . just a few hours of getting used to the between - the - toe thing and i was set ! i highly recommend them and hope they still have them when these wear out . . . if they ever do . 
i ' m on my 3rd or 4th pair - i love them . i wish the soles lasted a bit longer or that it would be possible to just repair the soles for less than buying a brand new pair . 
just perfect ! i love this shoe and have ordered it in many colors . birkenstock is always true to size and i cannot live without them ! the toe thing does rub , but i keep wearing them regardless . 
this shoe fits good , and they wear good . i just need to break them in like any other shoe . i like the color and the style just fine . i would reccomend them to anybody . 
great shoe @ an even better price . birks are amazing , i live in south west texas & it is hot almost all year round , therefore we can wear sandal ' s most all year , birks give great support with great style . 
this thong style didn ' t work for me . inexpensive flip flops have a more comfortable toe dividers than these shoes do ! i ' ll stick to the arizona or madrid styles from now on . thankfully , amazon has an easy return process . 
i am particular about shoes since i have flat feet and at the same time careful about ordering shoes on line since i have received some lesser quality product in the past . birkenstock had never failed to disappoint ! i love the fit of this style and the alignment they create in my joints when i wear them . i am very grateful for these and will be ordering more colors . 
i hate shoes - i will wear flip flops all day long and suffer thru the pain and stiffness . i used to hobble around when i got up in the mornings . these shoes are amazing . wearing these instead of flat flip flops and my heal pain and stiffness is gone . i got them soaked in flooding , which concerned me - they weren ' t as wonderful after they got soaked - it messes with the cork obviously , but they ' re still wonderful . i ' ve had them almost a year now , and just now had to put the latch thru another loop bc of stretching , but they still look brand new and i wear them nearly every day . 
these sandals are very comfortable and provide great foot support ! my first birkenstocks , and i am now a believer . i know i will be buying more birkenstocks in the future ! 
i ' ve worn birkies for years and these are my favorite summer sandals . . . great support and they stay on your feet . actually they mold to your feet with wear . my third pair . they look great with everything but a suit . these have a real arch support . if you ' re flat footed you ' ll need to break them in gradually or you ' ll develop achilles tendon pain . 
i love these . they match everything . so comfortable . all summer i wear birkenstocks . . . . i ' m ordering a gold pair next . love love love 
i needed support and style and this is the sandal that does it all . i have gotten so many compliments on this shoe . these are sturdy , and comfortable . 
for someone that works on their feet 12 hours a day , these shoes are amazing when i ' m off the clock . i bought a similar pair ( closed ) to wear at work at are by far the best investment i ' ve made for my feet in a very long time . the comfort i have with them cannot compare to anything , not even the custom made orthodics ! will definitely be buying another pair soon . : ) 
love these shoes . i had them in white and this summer ordered in this color . i love the comfort and i find them sufficiently stylish to wear out in public : - ) perfect shoes for looking put together and still able to chase my 3 boys around . 
i can walk all day in these sandals . they do require some breaking in or getting use to . but once thats done they are amazing ! i wore mine around the house for about an hour at a time for a few days to break them in . 
my 14 - year - old daughter was pining for a pair of brirkenstocks , which caused my wife to cringe and me to think & # 34 ; great , next comes the tie - dyes , patchouli oil , dreds and the occasional bathing & # 34 ; along with the $ 100 + price tag . but she picked out this style and they actually look great , she loves them , and my wife now wants a pair as well . 
i will most certainly buy more of these sandals in different colors . i have a very wide foot , size 7 in an eee to eeee ( mostly eeee ) and these shoes meet my needs . they are pretty and well made with excellent materials - i would recommend to anyone with similar wide feet as mine . i love these shoes ! one of the things i especially love is that they have no heels , just not even surface which is such a relief on my back - i have spinal stenosis and any kind of lift in the heel is torture . . . thank you for a wonderful pair of sandals . . . 
i love these and i ' m on my 2nd pair now . the first pair i wore out so much that the cork cracked right along the ball of my foot on one of the shoes . they are stiff at first but once you break them in , they are amazing ! 
love these sandals . it ' s extremely hard to find sandals for women with support and these are awesome . fits true to size . i ' m normally a us women ' s 9 . 5 so i got the size 40 . no regrets 
wear these all the time . thought they would hurt my toes , but not so . comfortable , glad i got them , and will definitely order more when mine wear out . 
but like most birks , are pretty stiff when you first put them on . it helps to bend and move them a little and it really helps to get them slightly wet and then wear them as they are drying . they are very cute and the part between your toes isn ' t as uncomfortable as i was thinking it would be . your toes have to get sensitized if you haven ' t worn flip flops for awhile , i probably haven ' t consistently worn flip flops since my youth , quite awhile ago . they are the normal good birk quality and will last for many years . i am pleased with these sandals and would recommend them to anyone . update : these shoes are super good quality and very comfy , just as i thought . two summers later and they still look pretty new and i wear them alot . they stretched very little and the part between your toes is holding up so beautifully . a lot of thongs rip that part if you go down a hill wrong or something , no way with these , never happen . 
these shoes fit true to size and are super comfortable . i wear a size 7 , so ordered 38 in these shoes . after wearing these birks for a week , i ordered another pair in red . no breaking in period . 
i chose to purchase these sandals on amazon for the free returns , and i am glad i did . i was unsure what size to get since this was my first purchase of birkenstocks , and the first pair i ordered ( 37 ) seemed a bit too large . when my heel was all the way back in the heel cup ( as it is supposed to be , according to the fitting instructions on a few websites i read ) , there was about 1 / 2 inch left at the top of my big toe . i also had to tighten the straps to the tighest setting . i returned the pair for a size 36 , and these seem to fit much better , and give more support . i almost always wear size 7 , but occasionally 6 . 5 in some brands ( maybe 1 out of every 5 pairs of shoes i purchase ) . so these definitely run big . i haven ' t broken them in yet , and i can tell that it may take some time , but i will do it gradually like you are supposed to . overall , i ' m excited to wear them this summer , and happy for the price i got them at . i originally got the black , but got the golden brown when i got the smaller size . i didn ' t particually like the black birko - flor strap as much . 
perfectly comfortable . i use as house shoes as i cook and stand in kitchen a lot ! my body aches at night if i don ' t wear cork bottom soles . my wicked good slippers are just too hot for summer so these have worked blissfully after a week of using them . 
these sandals are comfortable when i ' m just standing but i had a hard time adjusting to them when walking . i recently spent six hours a day , three days in a row wearing them and did a lot of walking so i consider them broken in . i find the bumps under the area between the toes and rest of the foot somewhat uncomfortable . they push into my feet while walking . i have a wide foot so the outer side of my feet go over the edge of the sandal . 
i live in these shoes . i ' m a first - time mom , and these shoes are exactly what i need to run my errands and take care of my baby . my feet always feel so cozy and nice . they look trendy , too . i want them in another color ! 
it was way too narrow and the model i actually don ' t like . . . it ' s really more for petit feet , besides that it is more narrow than other birks . 
i have several pairs of birkenstock shoes and love them . they helped me resolve some foot issues long ago and i have been wearing them ever since . i like this sandal style a lot . 
this shoe was very cute and seemed to be super comfortable but i ordered 2 or 3 sizes too big . i ' m not sure what happened . i thought i read the sizing right but maybe not . i even let a friend try them on that has a bigger foot than me and she couldn ' t wear either . again this may have been my fault so double check the size before you order . with all that said i do think that i ' ll be ordering another pair because they did seem to be very comfortable and they looked great . the size just needs to be perfect for these shoe to fit right . 
my first pair of birkenstock sandals , a great pair of footwear at a lower price . i will buy again 
these sandals looked so beautiful and would have gone with anything , but the cut was not at all right for my foot . in order for my big toe and second toe to be positioned correctly to hold the leather , my toes were pitched to the the very front of the sole so they looked too small in the front but too big in the back . if i had gone a size smaller , i think my toes would have hung over and i do not have long toes ! i spoke with my niece who has very different feet than i do and she had the same experience . my advice to anyone ordering online is to try them on in a store first . 
my sister loves these , so i tried to get a pair , but they were just too bulky for me , so i ended up giving this to my sis since we are the same size . great arch support though , great shoe , just not my style 
these were a great purchase , a little costly but they are worth every penny . the toffee color matches just about everything and you can dress them up or down . so very comfortable , i feel like i ' m walking on air ! i bought them for a family trip to disney and was worried my feet would hurt if i didn ' t invest in some seriously comfortable sandals . . these were just the ticket ! classy , versitile and comfortable , fantastic combination ! 
everything about the shoe was great , the problem was with my feet and any who has the same problem may want to order a half size larger . my two toes next to my big toe are longer than my big toe therefore , they went over the edge and i had to return the shoes , i did request a half size larger or a refund it they were unavailable . 
i ' m a large size ( 34 e ) and have a panache sports bra that i absolutely love , so i was surprised to find that i didn ' t care for this bra at all . the band is not large enough to support a larger bust , the straps offer no help either ( although the band should do the work anyway . ) the cups themselves had a strange shape , shallow but large , sort of pushing things down on your chest . this actually worked as a minimizer , so in that way it could be beneficial . but with the poor support , i wouldn ' t want to wear this bra in public . it was comfortable - - that and the minimizing were it ' s good points . other than that , a waste of money for me . it would probably work well for a c - d cup or smaller . 
if this bra had fit , i still wouldn ' t have kept it . it is , as with all microfiber ( aka tshirt ) bras , very stretchy , so i always order a band - size down ( 32 instead of 34 ) . however , the cups are huge . i was looking for a demi bra - or something with less coverage than this . it is more a 3 / 4 or full - cup bra when i get the correct size , and that isn ' t for me . if you want a demi bra , get something else . also , the shoulder straps are set for a frame larger than mine . they barely rested on the edges of my shoulders , and i am not a small girl there . this bra would definitely be visible around the edges of most summer tops - tanks , and other tops that show the chest or are sleeveless . 
if you ' re like me and you have trouble keeping your girls " front and center " instead of in your armpits , this may be a great choice for you . i wear 30dd , which is hard to find , and panache is one of the few brands that understands that needing a small band doesn ' t mean " training bra " . i love this bra , but it took me some time to get used to it . it fits differently from many other bras because it actually encloses all the tissue , which can feel awkward . when i first got this bra , i was trying to wear it the way i ' d always worn my bras ( the wrong way , it turns out ) , and i was pulling this one down too far and expecting the straps to sit closer to my neck . i was getting the " quad " look , big time . i read on a bra blog that the way to " set " breasts in a bra is to pull up on the center gore after the bra is all strapped and tugged and swooped and scooped . i tried this , and the whole fit of this bra changed . everything literally fell into place , with the cups filling up but not cutting in . this bra lifts and centers and gives me a beautiful round shape , even under tight fitting shirts . 
i am a panache fan , apparently the brits know how to make a quality bra that lasts more than 6 months . uk and us sizes are different , go to barenecessities . com to check a size chart . us i wear a 36g , in uk a 36f . ( h is ff ) the band doesn ' t seem like the fabric will hold you up but it does , and comfortably . 3 row , 2 hooks . hools on first for first wear , after a day of rest , go to the second row . the way the bra looks on the model is how it should fit on you . you are not wearing a large enough cup size if the center of the bra doesn ' t rest on your breast bone . other panache porcelain bras i have are now hitting the one year mark and am still using the last two rows of hooks . i top load machine wash cold on gentle cycle with the bras stacked in a loungerie bag , hang to dry , never put your bras in the dryer , the heat breaks down the fabric . at $ 50 a pop the dryer isn ' t worth having a bra last you only 6 months . hand wash or hand wash cycle in a front loader without the bag is okay too . 
very comfortable bra . sizing runs on the small side . i usually get 34 but from experience i know panache runs small so i ordered the 36 and it fits well . looks fine under t - shirts even for those of us that are larger . 
i really love these bras . they give me great support , they are cut low enough that i can wear lower cut tops with them without the bra straps showing . they also don ' t push my boobs too far apart . the straps may be just the tiniest bit wider set than some of my other bras but they are generally hidden under all of my clothes . no seams or lines so they look great under t - shirts . i have 3 of these and wear them all the time ! 
i was hesitant about buying bras online , but this is the best bra i own now ! i ' m large chested so it ' s difficult to find 34e ' s in stores . this bra does the job , fits great & has shielding cups which i love . i am buying 2 more of these ! 
32 / e here . i love this bra , the padding is thick enough you never see nipple show through , but its a really nice light weight padding . kind of minimizes the boobs more than creating crazy cleavage , so this bra has kind of a slimming effect and works really well with tshirts . super comfy ! 
i extremely like my laredo paris western boot . these are my first western boots and the first item in which i ' ll put together a western outfit that i ' ll use when shooting my cowboy . 45 at the range . 
i bought these for my son . he loves boots and he wears them ever day no exceptions . i was worried about the wear on them because my son can go through a pair of boots in a couple of months he is really rough on them . but so far these have held up . there is wear on the soles of the boots and i think that will be the part that we have to worry about the most . but they have been a really good pair of boots . 
i wanted to make sure i had a chance to wear these before posting a full review . so i wore these as my only shoes in vegas for a week on vacation . i didn ' t have any problems , and i walked a lot . cons : - i bought the tan distressed . they are exactly the color of the copper kettle versions . i really had to check the stitching pattern to see that i got the right boot . i was expecting the color to show up equivalent to a typical timberland boot , so i had to deduct a star for that . - the bottom part of the boot looks and feels like good material , but the top part with the pattern looks plastic - y to me . i haven ' t had any problems with it , but to some people this may look cheap . - the straps to pull the boots on are sort of . . . i don ' t know . that is probably too nitpicky , and shouldn ' t stop anyone from getting these boots . pros : - affordable when it comes to boots . i thought i was going to have to spend a couple hundred dollars . - fit is great , and like others have said i didn ' t need any break - in time . i could wear these right out of the box . - the bottom part is pretty attractive and they look good with my jeans - the sole is oil and chemical resistant so it is solid and i feel pretty good about them ( i will wear the heck out of a pair of boots ) if someone were looking for boots , i would recommend these . i wasn ' t sure about buying boots online , but other than the color being off , this was a good experience . 
sold these before i went to belize . didn ' t get a lot of wear out of them , but they looked nice while i had them . i kind of wish i had kept them , now that i ' m back in the states . . . oh well . maybe a repurchase ? ? ? 
serves already 3 years and keeps good look too . light , comfortable boots , i recommend to every one who is looking for everyday use . 
i can ' t speak to durability in the long term , but i will say that they feel great on my feet and look sharp . they ' re not flashy - - you ' re not going to stand out in a crowd - - and the soles aren ' t leather , so they won ' t exactly work with your favorite suit . but with a pair of jeans , these boots look great . they ' re more comfortable than my old boots , which had leather soles and were made of watersnake skin , and while they aren ' t as distinctive - looking , they ' re still very nice . honestly , i ' d wear these boots with anything short of a suit - - so sport coat and slacks ? yep . they ' re really very nice and understated without being drab . they shine up really well and fit pretty true - to - size . i actually went half a size down from my usual size but got the extra - wide . i probably could have gone with a half size up , but they ' re still a great fit and comfortable as all get - out . now i just need to re - learn how to walk in heeled boots . . . oh , and one more thing - - these are really great for driving , because the heel is beveled inward , so you can rest your heel on the floor mat while you drive . i think it ' s a great touch . 
these were the most reasonably priced cowboy boots i could find . i needed them for a wedding ( yeah a wedding ) , but they served their purpose . i do not neccessarly like cowboy boots , so i am not the best judge of them , but overall these seem like nice sturdy boots . they look nice and fit reasonably well . they were on the bigger size considering my dress shoes are normally a 11 . 5 and these were a bit big at an 11 . 
i purchased this for my stepfather . a real cowboy working with livestock , harvesting alfalfa , etc . they are practical , durable , comfortable and economical , just what he wants in footwear . 
i love these boots . they are very nice looking and very good quality for the price . they took me only one day to break them in and they are now very comfortable . i stated that they are somewhat big but what i meant by that is that they are just slightly longer in the toe area than i expected . the size is exactly as i ordered and they fit me fine . i just didn ' t think they were quite as pointy toed as they are . however , that is my own personal opinion and i still give these boots 5 stars based on comfort , quality , appearance and price . i highly recommend them . 
i have a wide foot and large calves so i bought a size larger . should not have . they fit my leg well and the wide width made them a little large . i put an insert and they fit better . only problem is they are so soft they are a little floppy when i put them on . very comfortable . don ' t buy larger than your normal shoe size . 
superb in terms of size ( spot on ) , comfort and overall look and appeal . very versatile indeed with the sheer over tone to highlight this sutle tone . will gradually replace my shoe inventory with more alike 
this is a well - crafted basic nude pump . ( i bought the sandstone color . ) the leather appears to be of a good quality and arrived with no marks or imperfections . the fit was true to size ; i am an exact 9 . 5 and these fit well with no gaps in the back or pinching in the toe box . i felt as though the outer side could have been made to go a bit higher on the side of the foot as it almost wasn ' t deep enough for mine , right at the widest part of my foot right before toes begin ? it feels as though a centimeter or two higher would keep my foot more secure , so i deducted one star from an otherwise - stellar product . i also have extremely high arches which lead to my foot being " thicker " overall than probably a normal - arched foot . just keep in mind that every foot is different , so my experience may not be the same as yours . i loved the heel height . i ' m 5 ' 10 " and while i don ' t mind a heel , i don ' t want / need to wear the platforms and 4 " heels that are so popular today . this heel height is perfect for both business and evening for taller ladies . the nike air technology did make these so much more comfortable than the average heel . i wore them all over a cruise ship two evenings in very rough seas and the traction on the soles was much appreciated . 
great shoes they fit my 9 . 5 narrow feet well . eventually they might stretch i am sure but i will just use a heel pad since i have narrow heels as well . 
these shoes are quite comfortable and i am very happy with them to date . i really cannot tell the difference with the & # 34 ; air & # 34 ; insoles , but again , they ' re comfortable . i would definitely buy these again . 
i purchased these shoes in blue & love them ! they fit well & the heel is not too high so you can walk in them a distance : ) the shoe has some cushioning on the bottom & they are comfortable to me . this is a beautiful shoe for the price . 
but wasn ' t overly impressed . the shoe has a pointy toe which is a bit constricting . the heel is very comfortable and flattering , but the fit was a bit small overall . 
this is a stunning shoe for plain patent leather . i wear between an 81 / 2 and a 9 . i decided to go with a 9 and am very happy i did . in the 9 , this fit me well . the nougat color is a pale tan with a little pink . my skin is very fair , so for me , this looks nude . the color is very pretty , particularly in patent leather . i love cole haan shoes . they hold up well , and they are usually pretty comfortable . i know i ' m going to enjoy these for years and they are going to match everything . 
love these ! they are super comfortable . i ordered my usual size and found them to be true to size despite what others have mentioned . i want to buy them in other colors they are so great ! 
great shoe for wearing to work - related events . i initially sized up based on reviews , but the sized up was huge . this item fits to size - - the leather stretches ever so slightly during the day . 
my mom is 85 and these are her favorite type of shoes . they slip on and have plenty of room for her toes . 
this is one of my favorite shoes , which i now own in several colors . it is comfortable for all day wear and the sole makes it stable on hard surface floors . good value for the price and attractive with skirts and trousers . can also be worn without stockings in warm weather . 
shoe hugs your foot and makes it feel so good ! i have always wanted the fisherman style shoe for spring . i trust the aerosole brand and ordered the shoe . i will probably try some of the other colors as well . very pleased . 
i love thati there are no ties or fasteners to slow putting on or removing these shoes . the elastic near the ankle assures a comfy fit and allows some felexibility . i also like the attractivesuede surface texture . 
i love aerolsole shoes and this one is no exception . the color is a soft orange and looks great with denim and other summer looks . it is true to size and very comfortable ! 
fabulous ! a perfect fit and they look great . i ordered another pair . just in time for summer . thank you so much . 
best jewelry cleaner i have ever used & the great price is what prompted me to try this brand ! no more will i spend $ 10 a jar at wal - mart for jewelry cleaner & i do alot of cleaning & polishing ! 
this is the best jewelry cleaner i have used in years ! ! ! cleans my platinum and diamonds so well they really do sparkle . quick , easy . 
i recently got engaged and wanted something to sparkle up my ring as i am always doing something with my hands and lotions dull up the shine . just for that this works well . my ring looks wonderful when i am done soaking it for a bit . i have tried it on tarnished earrings and it didnt do anything but shine it a bit where it wasnt tarnished . it didnt take away even some fresh rust so it is not a deep cleaner by any naturei also think the tiny little brush that it comes with is somewhat of a joke . it is so flimsy with such little bristles i couldnt see how it could possibly do anything better than shaking the ring in fluid . if you are looking for the most basic shiner for your diamonds and such then this is a great thing to have on hand . i dont regret the purchase , just wish that a cleaner had a bit more versitility . i will still get my diamonds professionally cleaned every now and then despite having this . 
the cleaner itself is pretty good and has almost no smell . however , the brush is too small , with weak bristles and falls to the bottom of the jar ( it doesn ' t slide into the basket like the connoisseurs brand ) . essentially , the brush is useless . second , the basket it small and doesn ' t hold the jewelry well . despite the issues , for the price this cleaner is worthwhile . most jewelry cleaners run $ 7 - 8 a jar or more , while this was less than $ 6 . and for that price , i ' m willing to use an old toothbrush and fish rings out of the bottom . recommended . 
i ordered the blitz gem and jewelry cleaner in the short bottle with the basket and the brush . i received the tall bottle of concentrate instead - that does not include a basket or a brush . i do not have a jewelry cleaning machine , and would have preferred the convenience of just letting my jewelry sit in a basket for a few minutes rather than have to worry about diluting a solution and then finding a bowl to use and a brush to clean off my jewelry . cannot attest to how it works , though i assume it works like any other jewelry cleaner . will update if i have either amazing or terrible results . just wanted to post review to alert others you may not receive product ordered . 
this product works well and the cost is great . i really like stuhllers brand , but you cannot get it unless you are a jewler and my jewler doesn ' t carry it anymore because they make the customer buy it in bulk . so i decided to take a chance on this brand based on reviews . i like the fact it doesnt smell and am always in favor of the interior basket and brush . 
this works wonders on my gold jewelry and cleans the stones excellently . you have to leave the jewelry in the solution for longer than stated in the directions to get the intended results . 
it ' s a mild jewelry cleaner that seems to ' do the trick ' on lightly dirty items . the brush contained , could be a bit firmer ( it ' s very soft ) . fashion jewelry comes out pretty sparkly - - and my diamonds the same . cleaner is non - toxic - - a must for me ! 
i love this jewelry cleaner . i use it every day . it cleans and shines my jewelry and does an excellent job with little work ! 
this is a quick and easy way to clean your jewelry . you just drop it in the container and there ' s a little basket that makes for easy removal along with a tiny brush if you need more detailed cleaning of the crevices . even without using the brush , this cleaner does a wonderful job . 
my husband detests the discomfort of a bulky wallet in his back pocket . this wallet is slim outside but organized inside . it has one protected and one easy access section for storing cards and papers . " leather " is not indicated anywhere but the texture is not slippery leatherish , more like nubuck . very pleased with it . 
i like this wallet , but it ' s still rather bulky if you start putting things in it ! i wasn ' t a fan of the drivers license holder , but have changed my mind recently ( it ' s a flap that holds only your license - which is easily removed when needed ) . i like all the pockets for credit cards or buisness cards , but if you fill them up , you ' re gonna have to deal with the bulk ! 
i brought this as a gift and it was well received . they said it felt like butter , very soft supple leather . 
nyc men wallet . . bought it for sale so i dont rily knw wat its like after bein used for long but wen i received it . . it was nyc . . . soft and smooth leather . . nyccc 
my husband loves it . nice leather that ' s not going to fall apart , well constructed . no problems with fitting into pocket . 
i rec ' d this kenneth cole wallet , had about a month now and the stitching is coming out already . i have almost nothing in it so its not like its stretched out causing alot of pressure . 
it is a nice wallet . retailed at 40 $ . it comes with warning sign that says it has chemicals that cause cancer in state of california . . . : / 
nothing special great bi - fold wallet . i like the look and the feel of it in my hands and in my back pocket . 
this wallet might give you cancer or cause birth defects . . haha ! that was a little bit of a surprise . makes me wonder what kind of materials they ' re using . however , the wallet is very nice , very soft , and my husband loved it . 
it is very nice and from lther and if i need it next time i will by it agen ok 
i prefer trifold wallet my self . this is good quality and is thin yet holds 15 bills . 
backgroundafter two years i realized my old leather diesel wallet had come to the end of its life . i received a kenneth cole reaction mens wallet for my birthday . useage & apperancethe wallet consists of 11 slots for all your credit and business cards . there is a protective pocket that flips for your id / verification card . there are several hidden pockets that you can place such things as emergency money into . reliabilitythe wallet has sturdy sewing in its seams and is made of quality leather . the wallet feels durable and has held up rather nicely the past six months i have used it . pros : + + plenty of slots for all your credit cardscons : + + does tend to get rather bulky with all those cards and cash if you do fill up every slotconclusion : this wallet is durable , stylish , and very functional . it is a worthwhile addition to any mans wardrobe . 
great product ! just as expected ! the leather is perfect and the im never disappointed when i buy something from kenneth cole . 
this wallet is nicely arranged , and it looks like good leather . it is a bit thick , but i ' m ok with that . 
i ' m rather picky about the design of my wallet and that usually makes it very hard to find what i want . a folding , fixed id holder located on the left side is a must for me . this allows me to place all the truly important credit and debit cards that i use daily in the slots covered by the folded over id holder . this makes it impossible for them to accidentally fall out , but keeps them readily accessible when i need them . the other cards that i carry but never use can be placed in the inner , less easily accessed compartments and the few cards that wouldn ' t matter if they fell out and became lost ( like store " rewards " cards ) can be placed on the right side of the wallet . this wallet fits all my criteria in design and the construction appears to be top notch . no loose threads , no sloppy stitching , no unevenly cut material and it ' s made from soft , buttery feeling leather . some reviewers have mentioned that this wallet is very thick , but i ' d call it average in my experience . it ' s a real winner ! 
great wallet , high quality construction , nice feel . a little too thick with the fold up license holder . much longer than the us dollar , so will hold currency from all over the world . i like it , a bit too thick for my tastes . 
i loved the kenneth cole watch i received for my birthday in april and the wallet is no different . it has a great style , easy to remove id ( so great for clubs and restaurants ) and a removable photograph insert . the pockets have been a little stiff , so i haven ' t been able to utilize a couple inserts , but that is just a result of the quality leather . i am sure that after a couple months of use it will loosen up . i would buy another wallet from them in the future . 
its a nice , thin , soft , leather wallet . i carried it for about a a year and a half with no problems . eventually , i made my own wallet modeled after this one . 
the wallet is well made and holds a lot of stuff and keeps things nicely organized , but the wallet is too thick for my taste . i have been hoping that by sitting on it for a while that it would compact down some and it has , but it is still much thicker than i like . that being said , i still like it a lot and cannot downgrade it too far for that one flaw . 
i know as soon as i read kenneth cole that i am going to like the product . this wallet is no exception . i like how the drivers license tucks away so the plastic stays clear . if you have to show it often this is a huge benefit . main thing is , this is a nice quality wallet that looks sharp . 
~ i have owned a number of this same style watch over the last 25 years and i ' ve never cared much for other watches since . it is rugged and extremely attractive . since it is waterproof , i don ' t have to worry about getting it wet . it ' s made for navy seals so it ' s going to be a great watch . i give them to very close special friends as well as my sons . never had anyone say they didn ' t love it . i probably will be wearing these in my casket someday [ not too soon i hope ] . it ' s attractive enough to wear to a formal event , but rugged enough to be worn by spelunkers , sky divers , mountain climbers , and hikers all over the world . it will definitely be with me as i hike 500 miles in full backpack this fall . way to go amazing - zon ! ! ~ 
one of the best watches out there for rugged wear , nice illumination very accurate and durable , love the navy seal logo 
the basic luminox watch is a superb day watch . although i am on my second one in eight years , this may be a record , as i am not gentle with watchs . the first one ' s crystal cracked , but the second one is driving on like a champ . pro ' s - the luminous stuff on the hands and face ( tritium vials ) is bright . i mean really , really bright . none of this hold it under a light " silliness , but wake up at three thirty in the morning and have no trouble reading it . the twelve o ' clock tritium vial is orange not green , acting as an index point even in complete darkness . see remark about 0330 hrs . the bezel can be turned reasonably easily , but won ' t turn by itself when you are not looking . accuracy is good . shock resistance , overall durability is very good ( damage to my first watch was purely my fault and exceeded any reasonable expectation of survival ) . con ' sthe navy seal propaganda can be mildly annoying . the bezel is synthetic ( plastic ) , and after two or three years of use starts to go smooth and the numbers start to wear off . the luminous stuff on the hands and face ( tritium vials ) is bright . i mean really , really bright . this con is a special case . if a service member wants to wear this watch in the field , one of those watchbands with the flap to cover the face is a really good idea . the synthetic strap isn ' t so good . i replace the watch band with a nylon / velcro one on the first day . the little compass that comes with it is a wasted effort , get a suunto watchband compass . same size , superior in every way . on the whole , a tremendous value for money , and when i abuse my current one beyond usefulness , i will certainly get another one . 
i got this watch as a gift right before i entered basic training and i was really impressed with it . it ' s feather light , doesn ' t snag on your clothes or your gear , and the dial is super easy to read in the dark , but without being to invasive . the watch marched through basic training , through tech school , and water survival training without so much as a scratch . however , going through combat survival training in the snowy mountains of east washington , the pin that connects the case to the band broke without me noticing , and the watch fell off my wrist , never to be seen again . needless to say , i was pretty pissed that such a insignificant part of the watch would result in the loss of the whole thing . that ' s why i gave the product four stars and not five and also why i advise that if you buy one of these watches , you purchase one with the polyurethane band , that way if one pin snaps , the rest of the watch stays connected to your wrist . 
i have several luminox watches and they are all great . this is the original . it is very light ( the description here says that the case is steel , but i don ' t think so : it is hard plastic ) . the watch is very nice and durable . i am totally happy with mine . they are really great watches , very bright at night ( unlike most watches ) . i highly recommend this watch , especially at the price listed . the only minor thing is that the thing that you set the time with is not screw - down , which " purists " don ' t like . the watch is very accurate . 
first of all , some of the photos show this watch as gray . it is not gray , it is black . the first thing that struck me about the watch , taking it out of the box was the rubber watch band . it is suprisingly soft . it is a very comfortable band . the second thing was how light the entire watch is . i usually wear metal diving watches with metal bracelets . by comparison , this watch almost floats on my wrist . the illumination works as advertised . it is bright and stays bright continually . the gas lights are on all the hands , including the second hand , hour markers , and one on the bezel . the gas light at the 12 position is redish - orange , making it easy to orientate the watch in the dark , a nich touch . the gas light on the bezes at the nominal top is at right angles to the bezel , another nich touch . none of the gas lights need to recharge with an external light source , no need to push a button , they glow all the time . i got this watch for the illumination and it rates a 5 . no doubt about it . 
i have two of these watches and wear them everyday . the first i bought about twelve years ago just before i went to basic training . the second i got about five years after the first when i lost it ( though it was later found , recovered and still in service ) . the first watch was abused in a manner than no watch should be , it had been worn every day for years , been diving , jumped from planes with me , been to every bar in south america and then some . it was exposed to chemicals and hydraulic fluid on a daily basis and never had an issue . the tritium in bright and the watch keeps amazingly accurate time . as another reviewer mentioned the numbers and the bezel itself can wear down to the point the numbers can ' t be seen . that said it only happened on my first watch , the second still has good readable numbers on the bezel . i don ' t know if that is because the first one was exposed to so many chemicals . i ' ve abused both pretty well when it comes to outdoor activity . even now over ten years on the tritium is still bright and the watches still keep on ticking . i am more than happy with my purchases and would be just as happy to buy another luminox tomorrow if these both died on me . 
had this watch for three years . it is extremely light with a very comfortable band . i love wearing this watch everyday . however , like many of the folks here have noted . . . the watch is fragile . mine has needed the movement replaced twice . going for a g - shock , i can ' t see putting anymore money into this watch . 
i received this watch as a gift about 3 years ago and the battery is still going strong . one of the things i look for in an analog watch is the precision in which the second hand hits the markers and this one hits them right on target . the luminosity of the hour markers is outstanding and extremely clear in total darkness . the markers are so bright they enable you to see other objects at close range when you point the watch . no problems at all with the water resistance , case , crystal , or hands . so far , so good ! i still have the original strap and it ' s a bit uncomfortable when it ' s really hot outside . the watch is accurate and light weight so it doesn ' t feel like you ' re wearing a brick on your wrist . when i received the watch it had a mark on the back like someone had taken a drill to it , but this hasn ' t affected performance and since it ' s on the back , nobody knows it ' s there . i ' m not so sure about the navy seal claims , but it ' s rugged enough for non - seals . i ' d certainly buy this or another luminox watch . 
i ' ve had this watch for five years and was lured by the & # 34 ; navy seal & # 34 ; mystique . in that time period , it ' s gone through numerous batteries while the watch sat in watchbox most of the time . this watch uses about three batteries a year on average . i use excellent quality batteries that last two to three years on other watches . i wear the watch maybe 10 times a year and don ' t abuse it . the second hand fell off once and rotating dial came loose in the first six months . the case back screws rusted after three years . trying to deal with luminox was maddening and they wanted $ 130 to repair the watch with a three month turn - around . i took it to a local watchmaker ( has worked on my watches for 20 years ) who made it better than new for $ 60 . the watchmaker said not to take this into the water because he questioned the watch being & # 34 ; water resistant & # 34 ; because the original factory seal ( no pun intended ) was so poor . i ' ve had timex watches that are far better quality than this . my far less expensive casio g shock feels like far better quality . the stainless steel caseback is the best made part of this watch . it ' s sturdy . the rest of the watch is cheap plastic . i ' d like to see better build quality , more metal / less plastic a better water resistant seal . now onto the case : it ' s not much better . while it ' s hard and protects the watch because it has a soft foam inside , the zipper broke after three months . the red rivets on the zipper fall out of the case . again , dealing with luminox was unsuccessful . advice : don ' t be lured by the mystique of a & # 34 ; navy seal & # 34 ; watch . spend your hard - earned money on something else . 
this billfold is made of soft leather yet manages to feel very sturdy and " together " with a good no - nonsense design . while it ' s true that the pockets feel a bit too small for cards at first , the leather is pliable and will eventually mold itself to the size you need , allowing things to fit snugly inside the billfold without falling out while providing easy access to the cards you use most . all in all it ' s a trim , elegant billfold . 
purchased more out of need than want but this is a nice wallet . the quality of the leather is a step above my expectations for the price - point . initially , the pockets all seemed very tight but this is genuine leather and it stretched into the perfect size after a day or two . the design is very plain , the logo is discrete . 
based on the positive reviews , i bought this for my boyfriend who ' s owned the same wallet for half a decade to the point where it ' s falling apart . i thought it would be a more supple leather , but it was actually fairly stiff and had a weird chemical smell . the stitching and construction of the wallet seem ok , but the leather was weird . i tried rubbing some conditioner on it to soften it up and that helped a bit . 
it ' s simple . has a nice feel to it and there are no plastic windows that tend to break over time . plus , i enjoy storing my dl in a slot rather than the window since most places ask you to take it out anyhow . plenty of slots and the spaces underneath the slots allow for 1 - 2 additional cards with ease which is nice . overall for ~ $ 15 ( $ 18 - 20 % off amazon promotion ) it can ' t be beat . i spent a lot of time " researching " the different billfolds and reading reviews and i am glad that i ended up choosing this one . 
husband says he likes it but wishes it allowed for 2 or 3 more cards . ah well , nothing is perfect is it ? 
the construction seems sturdy and the quality is better than some of the less expensive models offered . rain coverage is enough for one person or two if they like each other . time will tell how durable it will be . 
my husband will take this on our next international trip . we were impressed with the ease of operating it and the size is perfect to carry in the pocket of his pacsaf messenger bag . the quality is amazing , especially given the price ! ! ! i high recommend this ! ! 
my mother asked for a small unbrella for christmas . one that would pop out with a button . i hope she will be satisfied with this . 
i have purchased cheaper umbrellas from amazon , half - price and less compared to this one , and i got what i paid for . they quickly start falling apart even under gentle , occasional use . i would have been better to have bought these longer - lasting ones from the start . bought several more for the whole family . 
the push button works and makes it a good alternative for keeping in the car . it is a bit small for heavy rains , but really helps in surprise situations . we use it to supplement a larger umbrella we keep in the trunk . 
when it starts to sprinkle and i pull out this automatic umbrella i feel so bad ass . it ' s like magic . it ' s the acme of technology and if all of my purchases had epic opening / closing buttons i ' d really feel like i was doing well in life . i wish it rained more so i could use this more . i want to look cool and that is exactly what happens when i whip this out . 
sturdy and strong to withstand heavy thunderstorm with neat auto - open and close at a press of a button . lightweight compared to other similar umbrella with such function . 
this got bent out of shape really quickly after buying it . i still use it with one part bent down but only because i don ' t want to spend money for another one . probably would not buy again . 
i like the button which opens and closes it . it collapses to a small size , so it ' s handy to travel with . 
it arived and does not work , at all . maybe yours will but my order came new and doesn ' t work . also , now that i see it i have a collapsible umbrella already that is nicer and has an extending handle . this one has a very short handle . you would have to hold it on top of your head ! kind of weird actually . 
bought this for use in travel bag , mainly for emergencies . did not hold up well on first use during moderate wind , was able to bend back but now it folds up strangely and does not auto open from time to time . 
pretty good travel umbrella for the price . i got this umbrella to keep in my bookbag for when im trekking around campus . it does well for light rains . 
this is a good umbrella , though i ' ve only used it a few times . opens and closes automatically , though you still have to cinch it up when you close it . i like it because it ' s compact and fits in my briefcase . 
perfect size for my purse or backpack . it is good just for one person , but easy to use with the automatic open option . 
having left my small umbrella in the grocery basket , i was looking for a replacement . based on the reviews i purchased this product . it was the size i wanted and the price seemed reasonable . i put it in my car and i have yet to use it so i can ' t comment on how well it works except to say the automatic oprning mechanism seems to work fine . the umbrella also looked well made . i am happy with my purchase . 
i live in tallahassee , which is the unexpected rainstorm capital of the sunshine state - so having an umbrella on hand at all times is essential . this umbrella is ideal for carrying around ( it fits into the small side pocket of my swiss gear backpack perfectly ) because of its small size . unlike many other small umbrellas it is reasonably robust and provides a fair amount of coverage . 
haven ' t used it much but everything works as it should . nice little umbrella to keep me dry when it downpours . 
umbrella is made well . better than i would ' ve expected . i did get caught in a bad rainstorm in chicago , i had some water that was coming through the fabric but it wasn ' t bad at all considering the conditions . 
i received this as a gift from my spouse and could not be more pleased with it ! i have recently relocated to oregon from texas and i was in desperate need of an umbrella to help keep my dry on my daily commute to the office in my new town . this umbrella is easy to tote around in a purse or backpack , it shakes off easily , and the one - button - open action is much appreciated . there isn ' t much worse than standing in the pouring rain trying to get your umbrella to open . no worries about that with this guy . this umbrella comes with a sleeve that you can store it in , however , i find it quite useless . it ' s hard to get it back in there and if you use it every day , it becomes a pain to fuss with . the wind has yet to turn it inside out on me , so it seems to be a sturdy design and product . i ' ve enjoyed having this and would recommend to anyone looking to stay dry . 
this isn ' t the most compact traveler ' s umbrella i ' ve had , but it is easy to stash in a pack or my computer bag . it has a spring - powered opening , with one touch of a button . when wet , all the folds make it drippy , so you definitely want to make sure you keep the sleeve it comes with . just insert the wet umbrella in the sleeve , then dry when you get home . it ' s a bit smaller that i would prefer , but . . . it is a traveler ' s umbrella ! 
this is a nice , compact umbrella that fits easily into a shoulder bag or large handbag . on a recent trip to normandy and england , i had to use my umbrella several times and the opening & closing mechanism worked well and was very handy for surprise showers . i did learn that , after closing the canopy with the button , in order for the mechanism to work again to open the canopy , one must pull the canopy section down to the handle until it ' clicks ' , thus resetting the open / shut mechanism . if this is not done , then one must manually open the canopy . this is not a big problem once the trick of the mechanism is understood : just pull the canopy back down once it is closed and it will be ready to pop open and up when the release button is pushed . i bought two of these umbrellas , one black for fall / winter and one blue for spring / summer and i expect to use them regularly during the year . when they wear out , i ' ll just buy new ones as the price is reasonable . . 
i have no complains about this umbie . it has carried me through bostonian sleet - storms and miami downpours . it is small , but remember this is a travel umbie , not a full - sized one . i generally wear a raincoat when it ' s raining / snowing hard , and use this to provide a little extra protection including my purse . it fits easily into my bag ( i don ' t use a large bag that contains everything i own . . . ) and works wonderfully . 
i like this one . the color of this one is very beautiful for me . when i first saw it , i think it is suitable for me . 
just as advertised / regular dish soap works just as well . 
i was hesitant to purchase the cleaner concentrate for my ultrasonic jewelry cleaner so i ran an experiment with some of the jewelery in most need of cleaning . you can definitely use plain old soap and water , and it will do an ok job . what jewelery went in came out noticeably cleaner using plain soap . but , i ran a different set of equally dirty jewelery with water and about a capful of the concentrate and it clearly worked better than just regular soap . the silver came out with less tarnish and dirt using the concentrate , and it came out shinier and more polished looking than just using plain soap . now that being said , if what you need to clean has been really neglected starting with soap and water , rinsing , then running with fresh water and concentrate will make it sparkle . 
i have a jewelry cleaner - just a little of this and i also use a little of dawn dishwashing to it and it does a fabulous job ! cleans inside and out of all my jewelry ! ! 
this cleaner does the job . i liked that it didn ' t have a strong smell or burn my fingers when cleaning like other cleaners . i did have to put some elbow grease into it when rubbing with the cloth , but that may just be from the vintage condition of some of the sterling jewelry . i ' d def buy again . 
especially like using with the hagerty brand horsehair silver cleaning brush sold on amazon . com ( asin : b000j30o22 ) . for cleaning fine jewelry , chains , and detailed silverware . 
works great in ournew trent cd - 3800 digital ultrasonic for jewelry , eyeglass , and dentures cleaner . i used it to clean a 3yr old casio gshock watch that has never been cleaned and was filthy and it worked great . i also have used it to clean my fiances diamond ring and sunglasses and it works great for those too . 
helps when cleaning jewelry . use just half a capful in the ultrasonic jewelry cleaner . when water appears not clear , dispose of dirty water . be sure to rinse jewelry after using cleaner . 
overall i think this cleaner is good but i can ' t tell if it ' s the cleaner or the jewelry cleaning machine that does the hard work . 
used in an ultrasonic cleaner to take years of goop off of heirloom jewelry . works as advertised and seems to make the goo go . 
great product . works very well in cleaning jewelry especially in a jewelry cleaner . i definitely would purchase this product again . 
works fantastic ! not even a cap ful is needed and you will noticebly see the shine in your jewels ! works very well with the geooro spa machine . try it - you will not be bummed . 
this is the first of its kind that i have tried , so i guess it ' s ok it cleaned my jewelry just fine . would recommend . 
i bought this with an ultrasonic machine and have been using it with the machine since the beginning . everything looks great after using it . in my second batch , i only used half of the amount they recommended because the earlier batch seemed unnecessarily soapy . still seems to work well with half the amount . the only caveat is that i have been thoroughly rinsing everything after using this product . it seems to leave surfaces a bit tacky if you don ' t fully rinse them . i wonder if this can lead to jewelry actually getting dirtier more quickly ? still , the stuff i cleaned was pretty filthy . maybe testing the machine without the cleaner would make it more clear . 
this stuff really works well . it does smell a little strong , but apparently doesn ' t contain anything toxic . i usually use it with pretty warm water in a mini ultrasonic to clean jewelry and other small delicate things . it does a great job . i agree with others that have said not to use the directed amount . i just barely use a capful and that seems like it ' s plenty good . this bottle will last quite a while . made in usa . 
i used this product per the directions exactly - - - not a good investment for me . . . it did nothing to clean or improve the appearance of my jewelry 
a few caps of this work great in my ultrasonic cleaner - a little goes a long way ! it ' s amazing how much dirt and grime this cleaner can get out of your jewelry . some tarnished jewelry i have has literally come back to life with this ! 
i bought this to accompany my new sonic wave machine and it seems to work well . it didn ' t & # 34 ; dissolve & # 34 ; every sign of dirt but i don ' t think any do 
had to order a sonic jewelry cleaner for my old gems and i ordered this cleaner with the unit . the cleaner worked perfectly , my gold jewelry and diamonds came out looking sparkly . also , there is no need for more than 2 capfuls for very clean jewelry . good for all gold , semi - precious and silver ! 
you wont believe how dirty your jewelry is until you use this stuff , it gets everything off with no residue . 
cleans jewelery well enough to lift of grime and dirt but not the & # 34 ; right ouf of the jewelery store & # 34 ; look . 
i used it with the sonic wave cd - 2800 ultrasonic jewelry cleaner . works like detergent should . i followed the amounts suggested for a dirty watch , then mixed the solution lighter , using 3 cap fills instead of 4 for cleaning a pair of eye glasses . 
this stuff works very well . i haven ' t cleaned my ring because i ran out of the stuff i got from wal - mart . so i thought to try this , and can i tell you my ring looked brand new again . i couldn ' t believe how dirty it was before , it was so sparkling after using this ! 
i always get compliments after i clean my ring with this . i think it is for machines or something but i mix it with water and use a tooth brush and it gets the job done . 
this jewelry cleaner works pretty good for my wife ' s jewelry she uses it once a week never had any problems using it her rings look real good will buy more for her . 
the cleaner cleaned the jewelry very well , but i had to measure the amount as there were no lines on the bottle marking the amount to be used each time . 
this cleaner works well . my jewelry comes out looking like new . the only concern i have is it doesn ' t get off built on stuff such as lotion . i have to take a brush and really scrub the grime . 
i use this in my sonic cleaner . my diamond rings sparkle , my costume jewelry cleans up and it ' s great for cd ' s 
i use this in my electric jewelry machine . this is great to clean silver , diamonds , . looks professionally cleaned once finished . have been using for years . highly recommend it ! 
this works perfectly with your jewelry cleaner . its exactly as described . i would definitely purchase again . my jewelry came out so shiny and clean . 
works great with the sonic cleaner i bought . no complaints . my rings look drastically brighter when they come out of the cleaner . 
this is a great jewelry cleaner - i use it with an ultrasonic cleaner and my jewelry comes out clean and sparkling ! 
i am not sure if this does what it says it does . . . . i mean . . . i have an ultra sonic tank and i use this stuff but i can ' t always get it to smell right . . . my watch smells like sweat when i don ' t wash it . . . stainless band . . . this stuff makes it smell alright for a day . . . but so does water , but i leave everything in there from when i go to sleep , then when i wake up , i put it on after it dries . . . but i don ' t know , i don ' t have anything to put this up against . . . but if i run out . . . i might buy it again . . like i said . . . a day . . . and it doesn ' t cost an arm and a leg : ) 
it oxidizes my jewelry pieces so i don ' t like it ! ! all my jewelry were stained with this product . . . i was really mad 
i must says i wasn ' t sure how well blitz gem & jewelry cleaner concentrate would work . i am pleasantly surprised how well it cleans along with my ultrasonic jeweler cleaner . 
i was amazed at how wonderful a job this did without any effort on my part . i put the solution into warm water in my ultrasonic cleaner and dropped my jewelry into the basket and ran three cycles . i rinsed with warm water and it was sparkle , sparkle , sparkle ! 
i have a lower priced sonic jewelry cleaner and have found this solution to work wonders on all my fine jewelry . my gold chain and small hoop earrings just gleam ! this is the third bottle i have purchased and i highly recommend it . by the way , the directions call for using three capfuls of the solution added to water . i have found that two are plenty . i will buy this product again . 
i used this with my new ultrasonic cleaner , and all my jewelry came out sparkling ! i will be buying more when it runs out . 
use small amount with the sonic cleaner and jewelry will sparkle . a little goes a long way , use on copper . too . 
i used a cap of this in my black hills gold model 890 ultrasonic cleaner . i ran the machine for 3 minutes per the instructions . the machine and cleaner removed the irritant under my channel ring . happy ! 
purchased with the professional ultrasonic jewelry and eyeglass cleaner . . . these two together are a powerful duo and can ' t function without the other . it ' s like batman without robin , iron man without pepper , superman without lois . . . get the picture ? i hope marvel creates a movie based off the work that these two super heroes do . nothing fights grime better ! 
i use it with ultrasonic cleaner model d3800a and i absolutely love it . i ' m not sure why i never used these things before , but my jewelry looks brand new after i clean it . 
very effective on diamond jewelry . a soft brush to get in the crevices may be needed . it says for jewelry cleaning machines but i use it in a jar with a jewelry basket . just added about 2 caps to 5 oz of water . works great 
placed this solutions in to the cleaning machine and had the diamond ring cleaned . this worked better than with the water by itself . 
makes precious stones sparkle . i ' ve tried 3 different gem cleaners , they all have the similar results . you only need a little bit added to water ( it is concentrated ) , so it lasts a long time . 
this stuff is incredible . my bracelets and watches look showroom ready . many compliments on my cleaned jewelry this week . . . . especially the rings 
not shore what to say . it dose work but doesn ' t seem to work as good as the stuff at the jewelry store they use . 
i bought this to go with an ultrasonic cleaner i was purchasing . i tried cleaning a ring with and without this , and i can say the ring seemed a lot cleaner after i used this item in the machine ( of course , it could have also been because it was the second time through the machine ! ) . the product doesnt have any kind of odor , and is clear and doesnt stain or tint jewelry items . i also used it in the machine while i was cleaning my eyeglasses , after rinsing well i have had no bad effects . the product works as advertised . you can , of course , always just use dish soap in an ultrasonic machine , and that is probably what i will do for my non - jewelry products such as my eyeglasses and cd ' s or dvd ' s . i will continue to use this cleaner for my jewelry for now though . 
purchased this after using my sonic wave jewelry cleaning machine with just water . the difference between clean with this and just water is like night vs day . i am very happy with this product . 
this got my diamond rings sparkling and my glasses smudge free ! i highly recommend this product . it is best for gold and platinum . i have not yet tried it with sterling silver . 
i got this for my jewelry . it cleaned some of it but some pieces that i know are real sterling silver from south america didn ' t get cleaned at all . just ok . 
we use this in a jewlrey cleaner and only use a capful for cleaning rings . it works marvelous , much better than water . when done cleaning , i just rinse the ring off with water to get any soap residue off and it looks spectacular . 
better than a drop of dish soap for sonic cleaning eyeglasses , no smears , no smudges , no rinsing required - great product , fair price 
this cleaner really improves the cleaning ability of my hydrosonic jewelry cleaner . much better than just water . make sure to follow the directions for the type of stones recommended . i will buy this again . 
this makes my rings look like new . it is a good cleaner and works great in the jewelry cleaner machines . i want to always have this around . 
i have looked everywhere for a grey jersey robe that was long - something that would feel like slipping into a great silky t - shirt . . . and this is it ! fit is great , fabric is soft , the weight is perfect - not too light , definitely not heavy . the feel is feminine , but still very modest . wish it wasn ' t quite so pricey . . . but i paid it , & i ' m not returning it ! 
wanted to like this robe , but it ' s a big disappointment . it doesn ' t drape well on me and hangs badly in places . i ' m 5 ' 5 and 118 , and the small size should have fit better . i ' d prefer it longer than reaching the top of my calves , and it ' s awkward to reach up high for anything because of the constricted way the sleeves are cut . for the price , i was hoping for a robe that looked becoming . it just looks dowdy and sloppy - - not classy as i ' d expected . on the other hand , a fun robe i bought from kmart ' s site on a lark for only $ 18 looks much better . i ' m returning the shangri - la robe . for the same money i can buy something i ' ll actually use . 
i absolutely love this robe . . . the fit is perfect & it is so comfortable i hate to get dressed in the morning . . . i am already thinking of ordering another one in another color , just to have on hand for when this one is in the wash , or w / e . . . excellent choice , a bit expensive , but at least it is something well worth it . . . not like so many choices online , where one doesn ' t always know if this will be a good choice or not , know what i mean ? ! ? well done , will be back ~ ~ ~ highly recommend this one ! ! ! 
i ' ve been looking for a robe like this for a long time , the material is so soft and it drapes perfectly . the negative would be the price , it is way too expensive . however i am glad i splurged on it because there is nothing more comfortable than to slip into this after a long day . 
this robe is exactly as it looks in the picture . nice and light weight , yet good quality soft jersey like material . i actually love the robe , it is what i was looking for to a & # 34 ; t & # 34 ; so i am thrilled to have found this . it washes beautifully too ! the reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is specifically because of the price . way too much money for this robe ( i paid $ 98 ) . it is a catch 22 because i love it , but the price just seems a bit unreasonable . i am still glad i bought it , though hard to choke on paying that kind of money . if you can afford it , it is a worth while purchase . 
very comfortable . . . generous cut . haven ' t washed it yet to ascertain if there will be shrinkage . love the pockets and the color is a bright spring day ! 
if you are looking for a robe to wear while doing your hair and makeup , look no further . this is a soft , silky , lightweight robe that ' s comfortable under a hair dryer . it ' s full length on me , 5 ' 1 " with a petite frame , maybe a littlle longer than i like , and the cut appears to be full . i usually buy a small instead of an x - small because i like things a little loose , but this is a little looser than i prefer . my next one will be an x - small . it came from the washer / dryer unshrunken and unwrinkled . it ' s a good travel weight in that it takes up very little room when folded or rolled . 
the heather latte in large looked like a baggy paper bag . i wear a woman ' s 10 / 12 . the large was oversized in an unflattering way . the sleeves are very wide . you don ' t get much coverage at the bottom , even though the robe runs large . it will " gap " along the legs . i am 5 ' 10 " and the length was just below the knee ( not a plus as far as i ' m concerned ) . as another reviewer noted , the fabric is almost translucent . it does cling . okay if you want something to travel with that doesn ' t take up a lot of space and is very light - weight . it is warm given the weight . i tried hard to like this robe ( given the very positive reviews other buyers had given it ) , but gave up in the end and returned it . 
overall this is a really good quality robe . it is super soft and definitely serves its purpose - i especially love the fact that it is cotton and that it is not too thick . this robe is perfect for summer or if you live in a warm climate . i bought it in a light pink color , and the only reason it is not getting the full 5 stars from me is because it is see - threw . if i am wearing just underwear underneath it , i do not feel comfortable opening the door or walking my dog outside - just in case the neighbors are around . so if you are planning to get the pink color , just know that you will most likely have to wear pjs underneath it ( if you plan to wear the robe in front of others ) . i love hanging out in my pjs and i go to the mailbox with robe on etc - if you plan to wear this in privacy then its definitely a 5 star product . 
fits as expected . does what it is supposed to do . might need to get something that tapes vs this as some strapless shirts are too low for it . 
i did read the review they were mix reveiws some say great some say not so great . well i took a chance price was good but once here i was like no way that is going to work out , i am 160 - 165 pounds and a 42 d cup and it fix well but the stupied foam things in the bra u can see them when u wear a shirt . if it did not have that myb it be ok . would not wear it out in public cause it is not even 50 persent soported . 
for some reason , this product just didn ' t hope to do what i thought it would do . i bought another bandeau bra in which my nipples showed through , so i looked for a bra with removable pads to fix that problem . this product just didn ' t do it for me . it wasn ' t as comfortable as the other bandeau i had purchased , and i found the material somewhat scratchy . also , i am a 34c and the medium fit me quite well , except when it came to the removable pads . they kept slipping to the sides and i kept needing to re - adjust them , which is really awkward to do in public . i wanted to like this product , but it fell short of my expectations . 
this item is pretty decent . it fits quite well and even works on larger breasted woman like myself . it took me awhile to find a strapless bra that would actually provide support & be comfortable to wear . this one does both ! i do highly recommend this product . 
i ' m a 38d and the xl is a bit big and slips a bit . a large would have worked fine . but it works on its own for under looser , more casual off the shoulder tees which is why i bought it . wouldn ' t wear it if major support was needed . 
love how this feels on . . . but being someone who is small chested . . . i probably needed something with a little more padding . it feels great on though . . . and i would definitely recommend this for summer events . . . : ) 
nice and soft , just right fit , not too tight and not loose at all , stays up , no pulling or sliding either way , don ' t know how i went so long without them . good quality fabric , recommend highly . i bought two of them the short version and the wider version . 
it is ok the only thing i really hate is that i have to keep lifting them up which is so annoying 
finally ! a comfortable strapless bra ! i am a 40c and ordered the xlarge and it was perfect for me . no sagging , no muffin underarms . the modesty pads are separate from each other so you can adjust to each girl . very comfortable material , breathes with you . hate the handwashing but its worth it for this bra . you wont be dissapointed . and it comes with tiny little straps you could use if you needed but why bother ? this is the first bra that hasnt rode up in the back . everything stays where it should . awesome ! 
it ' s okay , it ' s comfy and thought it would be a bit tight but it wasn ' t tight at all . when i put it on without the little straps that came with it , my girls just sagged and it didnt look good at all . but when i attached the straps to both sides it lifted and looked much better , really doesn ' t feel like i ' m wearing a bra at all . finally can wear off the shoulder tops / dresses for summer yay ^ . ^ i ' m 38d if that helps any and i got a an xlarge * * * * update on the item after wearing a few days * * * i think that maybe i got a size too big , the straps keeps getting undone and there doesnt seem to be much support so i have ordered braza plus size bandeau bra in large and hopefully that will be a bit tighter and give me more support 
these bras are nice . fit true to size and very nice . the option to remove the pads is a really nice touch . i will order this in other colors . very pleased with this purchase . 
i ordered this bra in a medium since i am somewhere in between a 34 / 36 c and it fits perfectly . it doesn ' t fall down for me throughout the day . the only thing i found a bit bothersome about the bra were the little cups . they seem to sometimes slide around inside the bra and it can be annoying . it comes with straps , which seemed to me at first to be a bit too short but they were actually perfect . 
having had bilateral mastectomy surgery months back without reconstruction , i was looking so hard to find something that i could wear comfortably and without being obvious that i had the surgery . all of the post cancer garments are higher than a cat ' s back and i could not afford any of those . i got very lucky and found your site on the internet and i thank you from the bottom of my heart . 
the cups were larger than expected , and the padding wouldnt stay in place . they kept sliding into my arm pits . i tried to remove them , but then there was to much material and it was very wrinkly under my clothes . not satisfied . i would prefer a thinner more beathable cotton bandeau . this material did not breath well at all . i was sweating in this all day . will not wear again . 
i am 5 ' 9 & # 34 ; 170lbs , and i weight a b cup 34 / 36 . i risked a medium and it fits snug . its a great item however ! ! i ' m not sure if its my small chest , but it doesn ' t not emphasis your chest at all ! even with the padded cups . it holds them well enough , but it acts more like a sports bra . 
this bra fits well and comes with a pair of straps however , the bra stays in place so need to keep adjusting it and i have no need for the straps . the material is comfortable and soft and washes well 
good fit but i wore it out while i was at a bar and dancing and it just kept falling down i had to keep going and fixing it . it is very comfy and i love how it feels when i wear it because you cannot tell you have it on but i wish the top was a little more snug instead of streatchy s it wouldn ' t fall down 
i ' ve worn this a few times , out of desperation . i ' d rather go braless than wear it again , however . i washed it , along with the passing inside , making the padding no longer no longer useful . the top digs in to my chest giving a strange deep indent if wearing a tank top of strapless dress . i ordered an x - large hoping to avoid the indent from the band , but going up a size didn ' t help . 
my sister gave me this watch as a christmas gift last month and i was floored when i opened it ! yes i was the one who picked it out by adding it to my " wish list " , but seeing it in front of me i couldn ' t believe my eyes ! as stated by someone else already the watch is big , beautiful and bold ! ! ! i love and collect watches and this one just shot straight to the # 1 spot . i wouldn ' t use it as a everyday watch , but i can ' t wait to have fun dressing it up ( sexy dress ) and down ( jeans / sweater ) . 
i got this watch as a gift and to be honest i was expecting a cheap quality . yet wen i received the watch and opened the packaging the quality of the watch is very good and the shine of the crystals is very catchy 
it ' s big , a bit heavy and bold with lots of sparkle . great watch for me to wear everyday . i tried to take out the pins for link adjustment and it turned into a nightmare . save yourself apologies for using bad language and damaging the links and just take it to a jeweler . for a small fee they will adjust it to your wrist . the pins are all but glued in there and are not an easy fix unless you have all the right equipment . even my jeweler had a few colorful words to say but did get the job done . this is my second watch purchase from amazon and my second guess watch . very pleased . 
i really like this watch . i was quite skeptical when it arrived as it was larger than i had though . it is also very heavy . i love it though . i think it looks great and works well with sweaters , and casual wear . it does look a little flashy so those looking for a subtle watch , this isn ' t for you . i love it ! ! ! 
the watch is beautiful . bought it as a birthday gift to someone . i only wish it came in a hard case box and not in a pouch . other than that , the watch looks very nice ! 
i usually love these type of watches , the picture gives a good idea of what the watch looks like . the band material is a bright stainless steel , the swarovski crystals are clear and dazzling - doesn ' t look cheap at all . the watch is big and bold . love ! as for quality - will have to give it more time . 
i got this watch some 5 months back . when i received it i was not very happy because the picture looks different from the real . in the picture it looks somewhat of a silver finish and a greyish tone . but when i opened the package it was shining and sparkling and the band and case was steel looking . but in the course of wearing it i just fell in love with the sparkle . and i also like heavy and big watches which this one sure is . . 
i have the withe one with the plastic strap the watch is beautiful but the strap gets dirty easily you could cleaned but i wont look the same as when you first get it . i try all the products in the market to make it look like brand new but it dosen ' t work not even clorox or acetone . if somebody knows how to clean this put a post 
i bought this for my 8 year old and it was kinda big . this bag is big and seems to be well made . 
i shopped for a backpack / bag that i could use while site seeing in dc this spring . i thought a shoulder tote would be too heavy and one - sided to serve my purpose but i wanted something that didn ' t look like i was trekking through the mountains . i needed it to be big enough to hold sweaters , water , snacks , cameras and purse contents since we would be gone for the entire day . it held a good amount of stuff i will say that . and i loved the turquoise color but it wasn ' t as comfortable as i had hoped ( it kinda smashed my boob ) forcing me to constantly adjust it . the phone holder on the strap is a total waste ( i ' d never put my phone in there and couldn ' t think of what would fit in the little space - - gum ? ) it actually gets in the way . by day 3 it was coming apart at the strap so i bought an $ 8 . 99 washington dc zippered tote at a souvenir shop and left the backpack behind for someone desperate or a homeless person to use . 
just requested shipping label . although nice in appearance it it is flawedthe strap is velcro attached with a weird huge heavy buckle that holds thethe short straps together when an adult tries to use it and the ends don ' t meet . nice color and all but useless even for very light loads . what angers me is this is the perfect size for me and the light sketching stuff i carry around except for the 2 or 3 inch too short strap . also not waterproof or water resistant . i like the makers style , so i hope they read and learn cause i think they would hit pay dirt with a few changes 
i bought this for my son who ' s in high school , he doesn ' t like backpacks and was fed up carrying a big messenger bag which banged his hip with every step . we are quite pleased with the purchase , the bag is sturdy and roomy , and sits nicely on the shoulder / back . it ' s also a good value for the money , at the moment these are priced between $ 14 and $ 21 depending on the color you choose . only two small adjustments could be made : one , i agree with the reviewers who say it could benefit from the addition of a water - bottle pocket on the outside , and two , if you are very tall / long in the torso , this might not fall in the right place , and you can ' t lengthen the strap , they ought to make it adjustable . 
i would have preferred that the strap not be quite so wide but it has two pockets in it . the bag drapes over my left shoulder and hangs on the back which takes the pressure off the shoulder . i have the purple and it is very pretty . i ' m going to order the turquoise and the hot pink . i don ' t think i ' ll use either of these enough to worry about the stitching coming undone and it ' s a very good price on a nice sling back bag . 
bought this as a gift for a friend who isn ' t much into backpacks or other carry totes who takes hikes . very roomy , fits a few items of clothing , smaller accessories , cell phone pouch with a good amount of space to pack it in and take off . he loves it . 
i bought this as a cheap throw - away bag for short - term travel since i had back problems and a full backpack was out of the question . i just needed something to hold my netbook and few other items . this was a pleasant surprise . it held my netbook case and kindle case , as well as a 16oz thermos and some other travel goodies . i didn ' t expect it to be very durable for the price , but it has held up well after three months of mon - fri lunch & work items carry use . i ' m not kind to it ; often toss it in the back of the truck . and i don ' t wear it with the waist strap as intended ; just throw it over my shoulder , but it works . kudos to whoever made this thing . probably wouldn ' t hold up well for a kid with a ton of books , but it works great for me . i ' d recommend it to anyone who ' s looking for a very inexpensive , non - fussy alternative to shoulder bags and / or backpacks . 
i ' m sorry to say this but i got this backpack for my daughter , and she used it when school started . and two days after using it she came home with the seams coming apart . very disappointed . 
should have looked closer at size . it small almost child sized . but it ' s fine as long as you don ' t try to fit more than one subject worth of stuff n at a time . 
this product is perfect for my teenager for a backpack to use when going to girl scout camp and when going to our local water park with her youth group . lots of pockets to hold inhaler and other items . 
the bag is just the size i wanted . good thing i did not pay attention to some of the reviews about how small it was . good enough for my trip to mexico . not a carry on size for me but good enough to hold most of my needs for the trip . 
this bag is huge ! love the fact it does not have a ' frame ' . just the right amount of pockets to keep little random things organized , and large open cavity to shove things in . right now it is the dead of winter , i will try to come back and update this once i put this bag though the ringer of some camping / hiking trips . 
i like this backpack . it ' s bigger that i imagined it would be , but is perfect for what i ' m looking for . i would take this on a month long trip to some third world country , but i would take it for a week long camping trip somewhere . for the price , i ' m happy with my purchase . 
this is a good pack . seems sturdy and is clearly larger than your average jansport , yet smaller than a full - on camping pack . great in - between size . i use it for gym clothes and other gear . only drawback is the waist strap is utterly pointless . it ' s way too high and provides no support whatsoever . a case of lazy design . otherwise , it would have been 5 stars . 
this backpack very comfortable on my shoulders and back since its straps are padded . the material is nice and pretty thick , although at first the smell might be an issue . the side pockets are big enough that i could pack in two regular water tumblers on each pocket ) . the stitching is nice , but mine tears up a bit on the top pocket . not a problem , though , since it doesn ' t influence the zipper or anything . i don ' t mind the giant main compartment since i ' m not picky with my packing , and i could pack a two - week stuff for backpacking , including sandals . all in all , it ' s practical and neat , and i could even fit this into the overhead compartment in the airplane . 
i picked this up for my grand son to use on our recent back packing trip . . it is a perfect compromise between a day pack and a backpack . it also worked great for the trip in and even held his tent . however on the trip out the main clip in the front of the pack would not un - clip . he wad to thread him self out of it to free himself . for the price of this pack however i will pick up a replacement clip set of higher quality and have the pack repaired . . if i need to buy another pack , i would buy this one again but also buy a better clip set and have the clip installed before we leave 
very cute ! i think that it runs a little on the small side . i ordered a small and a medium probably would have been perfect but , i kept it . look really , really cute on 
well made to small compared to other xls 
way too small for an adult . in an xl ! what did they think they were selling ? ? this probably would fit my 7 year old niece . 
not what i thought it be 
if you are like me and love camouflage clothing you will love the soft , stretchability and feel of this shirt . if you ' re smaller or larger it fits real nicely . it feels good against the body too . 
they are nice , but too small even for the price . if you are looking for gold earrings you better paid more for a bigger pair . 
these are the perfect size if u dont like large gawdy jewelry . classic styled hoop earrings that look awesome with everyday wear . 
these are small in size but overall a great value . italian gold , great gift for the woman in your life . 
there is a uniformity , latch that works well , and delicacy that are lovely . the set looks good on , as well . 
these are exactly as described . very lightweight , which is perfect for me . the etching gives them some depth . a nice change from regular gold hoops . 
i usually have an issue with tote bags because there isn ' t enough room for my law school books . other times my issue is that the bags that actually have enough space are often heavy by themselves . this bag has really strong straps and it has enough space for my stuff ( and pockets ) but its so thin / lightweight that it doesn ' t add additional weight to my load , so i basically love it . 
large , lightweight and well designed . can fit a ton of stuff in here . great sectional areas to store items . only annoyance is the slight crinkling noise the shoulder straps make . 
just got back from europe and this bag worked great . i love the length of the straps for over the shoulder . flat bottom sits well ; be careful not to overfill so it will still fit under the plane seat . i ordered black and would like to have the bronze color too for summer travel . 
the tote bag is a perfect size . i bought it for travel but started using it immediately for shopping and gym . 
baggallini bags are one of my favorite brands . i ordered this in the beautiful tomato color . the tote is large enough to accommodate anything i put in it . it ' s great for travel and durable . 
i love baggallini . it stays looking good forever . i have a small tan bag that i use for shopping and it still looks good after about four years . i love the light blue interior of this bag as it makes it easier to find items . the only thing is that i wish it had more inside pockets with zippers or velcro closures . i have only used the bag once but plan to use it for arts and crafts shows and travel . it is as advertised so i wasn ' t disappointed . 
this is a very nice tote bag but only had " 1 " large zipper pocket inside the large main compartment instead of " 2 " zipper pockets as advertized . it does have a cell phone pocket , another smaller pocket and key fob on the inside . the picture of the inside looked like it included a mesh zipped pocket , which it does not . i guess this is the older bag instead of the updated one which is disappointing as things will fall out of the two small pockets easily when the top is turned down . 
this bag could be perfect if it had longer straps . when it ' s stuffed full , the straps are nearly impossible to get over my shoulders . and i ' m a very petite person . i can only imagine the difficulty a larger person might experience trying to shoulder the straps when the bag is full . 
seems like it will hold up . haven ' t has the chance to use yet . wanted a packable extra bag in case i needed it for vacation purchases 
this bag has great quality except i don ' t like how the handles are not attached at the top , but in the middle of the bag . i think this is so you can tuck in the extra fabric if you don ' t need it , but that makes it hard to see what ' s in side and kind of sloppy looking . i ' m returning and ordering the town tote , which may work better for me . this bag is probably better for travel than everyday . 
when it comes to this tote , i like it and i don ' t like it . the material is shiny and nice looking , but almost too shiny for a guy . i decided to keep it because it will hold a lot of items when i do too much shopping at cvs or rite aid . i would like it better if the handles were shorter and a little stronger . also , i kind of wish they were stitched closer to the top of bag . the inside is a nice tan color with a large zippered pocket and a small pocket for a smaller ipod or small cell phone . on the front , it has 3 open slightly deep pockets and 1 zippered pocket in middle . there is a wide deep pocket on back for something light like paperwork , etc . it is held closed by the back handle . the only other negative is the fixed bottom , which makes it hard to fold up smaller . otherwise , i guess it makes the bag stronger . folded , it is about 8 . 5 & # 34 ; deep and 18 & # 34 ; long , so you would have to have a long plastic bag to carry it in until you get out the store . that is what i do , unless i do it near the exit door . if you are driving , just carry it under your arm or in hand , or transfer items to bag when you get to car . 
this is a great sturdy , light , well - organized bag to carry in emergencies . it saved the day on a recent trip as i took back much more than i brought over , & this worked well as my carry - on because my purse and all gifts fit into it . it folds up small , but holds a lot of contents once opened . baggallini makes great products . 
this bag is monstrously huge . it should be categorized as luggage . it ' s like " take to the beach " huge - you could fit a rolled up beach towel , cover - up , sunscreen , books , hat , sunglasses , bottle of water , shoes , and still have room for the beach - ball . baggallini bags are great quality - but this one is too big and doesn ' t have much style . 
i was looking for a lightweight tote . i could see why people would love this bag for traveling . purpose for my purchase when i go to sporting events with kids - i could put their jackets in a bag , zip the bag and put it under the seat . the best part is if something spills on the bag i could wipe it off . it looks very very nice better than on the picture . i got it on sale , i think it ' s worth it even if you have to pay full price for it . i got in red ! for me it ' s a perfect size not too big and not too small and has a zipper . 
i liked the slim profile and light weight , but the pink one i got is now stained and faded from the sun and its zipper is constantly snagging . i ' m not a person who tosses around their bags , i try to care for my things and i ' m frustrated by the color being ruined so quickly . if you go with this bag , i suggest a dark color since it doesn ' t clean up well . i ' m a fan of baggallini and own several wonderful bags by them . this backpack doesn ' t seem nearly up to the standard of practical design , organization , or quality that i usually associate with the brand . 
love it 
it ' s difficult to find smaller backpacks for everyday use instead of a purse . this one fills the bill . it ' s nice and light for the summer , comes in lots of great colors , and is a nice size . i noticed that some reviewers commented that it was too small , but i didn ' t find that to be the case . i could definitely fit a wallet in the bag , if i chose . it has lots of compartments for credit cards , makeup , money and my phone , to keep things organized . it has two nice outside zippers for extras . i find myself putting my phone in the back compartment so that it ' s easy to find . you could put your passport in there , too , if you ' re traveling . there is more than enough room for any extras you might have , including your kindle . i ' m very pleased with my purchase . 
i like the baggalini brand in general . i bought this in the chocolate brown for an upcoming trip in an attempt to find a cross between a purse and a backpack . i do like the idea of the split zipper straps , which worked well and were a good length , although a tad bit stiff . i ' m sure they would soften up . i also liked the top strap where you can carry it by the handle - very soft and easy to carry that way , seemed very naturalthe problem is it was waaay too small for what intended it for . i tried to put my compact camera , a pullover top , my wallet , and some sunglasses in and that was stretching it ' s capabilities . i think this is more of a purse than a travel piece . nicely made though and the brown was a beautiful color . oh , one other thing that was kind of awkward is that the zippers unzip all the way down on the sides which is nice as you can get to everything a little easier . the thing i didn ' t like is that you had to actually hold one corner of the bag at the bottom to get the zipper to go up with out catching . i kind of wished the bag was a little more stiff on the sides so that you could pull the zipper up with just one hand . small thing , but it annoyed me . 
this baggallini backpack is really cute but alas it was too small for me . i don ' t carry a ton of stuff but as the other reviewers pointed out it barely holds a wallet , phone , cosmetic bag and misc . lipstick , comb etc . 
this bag from baggallini is perfect for traveling . it is not too big , not too small for me . i can put a book in the bag , along with kleenix , passport , credit cards , etc . there is a hidden zipper pocket on the back so when i have the bag around my shoulders that pocket is well hidden . 
i rarely buy handbags , but i really needed a new one . i wanted a little backpack purse , but one that had a handle and could be carried like a purse . this baggalini is the best of all worlds . it ' s a purse , a backpack , a sling bag - all in one . conversion is as easy as zipping and unzipping the straps and moving the clips . construction is solid . everything from the zipper pulls to the straps to the pockets scream quality . there is a place for everything . the main compartment has dual zippers and is secured by a magnetic flap . it ' s large enough to hold my kindle fire hd 8 . 9 " tablet and includes a strap for a pen , pockets for change and credit cards . i don ' t have to carry my wallet with me anymore . it ' s built into the purse . i had my doubts at first , but those cards don ' t fall out . the purse also sports zippered pockets on the front and back for convenience and security . i like the versatility . when i need my hands , it ' s a backpack . when i ' m just walking around , it ' s a sling bag . when i need to hang it from a table , it ' s a handbag . the only annoyance is the magnetic flap , which always wants to close when i have the bag open . on the other hand , that ' s an aesthetically pleasing feature . i ' m not sure i ' d want it removed . also , strap length is not adjustable . this might be a problem for some people . for me , it ' s a great bag . i ' m pleased with my purchase . 
i bought this for a trip to spain ; it worked at times , but i wished i had gotten something larger . i used it as my regular wallet kind of bag . it can hold a bottle of water , sunscreen , wallet , a little makeup - and that is with it all crammed in . better to use it as a backpack or over the shoulder , not really as a crossbody bag . i did use it as a crossbody bag at times , but it was very tight - good in some ways , as i don ' t think anyone could have taken something out of my bag without me noticing . 
we had a similar & # 34 ; ticket tote & # 34 ; for a number of years and generally had it around my neck from the time i arrived at an airport to the time we deplaned at our final destination . it took many trips with us but finally wore out on our last trip to new york . i immediately ordered this with my amazon app and two days later ( as always excellent prime 2 - day delivery ) it arrived . it serves us almost as well but with a slight bit of inconvenience . in use , we keep our passports in one section , our web - purchased print - outs and check - in passes in another and our other reservation information ( cars , hotels , etc ) in a third . this does not have quite the convenience where the zippered pocket is somewhat smaller in size and less easy to access . otherwise , this is a good product and seems very well made . 
it looks a little roomier in photo than it is is , but is a great product that i would recommend to anyone . 
i bought this one and a rick steves ticket organizer , this was by far , much nicer ! sturdy , kept things neat and clean , easily accessible . the rs ' s organizer crumpled , was difficult to get in and out of , wrinkled my stuff and was a waste of money . i got this one in orange and i like the unique colors ! 
i had to do allot of travel and this thing was just to big for me , especially since it was under my shirt most of the time . it was nice to have all of the pockets though for all the papers i had to carry along the way . comfortablility was okay . security was it is top notch though . 
very nicely finished and with lots of useful compartments - including a zipped pocket - that makes it a wonderful travel companion ! 
like other baggallini products , this is well organized , with many pockets and zippers to keep you organized . 
i have a couple of other baggallini ' s that i ' ve used in the past but i could always find something i wanted that was missing . one was too small , one too large , one too deep etc . this one is & # 34 ; the one & # 34 ; for me . i ' m a wheelchair user and i love that i can wear this across body and feel very secure that no one can & # 34 ; snatch & # 34 ; it away . i can access everything easily , it carries my water mug , my cellphone and if i have my ipad or papers or whatever they fit very well in the larger back area . it has just the right about of hiding places , the credit card holders , etc . everything one could ask for . this is definitely the one i ' m sticking with and i ' m so happy i found it ! 
for men or anyone over 5 ' 10 " , the strap is too short . the inside small pockets are much to small to hold anything that i can think of and what is put in them will fall out if the bag goes on its side or falls over . the cellphone pocket is too small also for anything but an old - fashioned flip or candybar phone . otherwise , this is a nice size bag with nice hardware , but nothing about it is really special . 
i ' ve been noodling all over the internet , trying to find the perfect travel purse and this hits all the marks . it has a comfortable and adjustable shoulder strap that can also be worn cross - body . it can hold my 750ml camelbak water bottle in the mesh pouch . the largest section can hold a lightweight fleece jacket - - or ipad , wallet , and other misc . items . sections - - there ' s a cool little " secret " zippered compartment in the shoulder strap , a large flat zippered pocket that lies against my body that i use for my wallet ( most secure ) , a large center zippered pocket ( previously mentioned as " the largest section " ) , and two front flat zippered sections , one with interior pocket and card slots . i ' m happy . update : i tweaked the water bottle pouch by cutting through the elastic , down toward the bottom of the pouch , creating an open " v " . sewed an extra piece of elastic across the opening and reinforced the bottom of the cut . now my bottle ' s entries and exits aren ' t such a struggle . a smaller bottle would also work ( ! ) , but i like to carry 750ml . 
i purchased this bag for traveling and it didn ' t disappoint . there are many pockets to accommodate your kindle / ipad , ipod , water bottle and all the other things you would like to carry with you when traveling . the bag is small enough that you don ' t feel like you are carrying a small suitcase on your shoulder , and is lightweight so you can carry a lot of " stuff " without being weighed down . 
i bought this for a 12 day european cruise . it was great . the different pockets were perfect for every need . it held a sweater , water bottle , book , snacks , money and more ! i loved it . 
i love the quality , love the space . but for some reason the bag slides around and always ends up resting on my hip . two other family members had the same issue . and the thick strap around the front is not flattering . 
i really like the bag , it ' s very useful and easy to place things where you can find them . . . just wish they would make some a little bigger with an additional small & # 34 ; change & # 34 ; pocket right below . . . it is very nice and would like to buy another in black if they would make one that color . 
cute bag , good size for around town . nice to have everything organized and in place . credit cards , id , checkbook , etc are in perfect place . the large zipper compartment can hold kindle , play book and organizer with ease . do not expect your droid cellphone to fit in the secret strap compartment - not going to happen . in fact barely fits in the side pocket . and the net to hold water is tiny so no water there but nice to drop in your keys and holds them secure . i use the secret compartment in the strap for cash - perfect . the strap to hold keys is great though a larger clip would be useful . 
i love it , it carries a lot of items and it has seperate compartments to keep them separated . i also love the company baggallini . . . because its bags are made of quality material . 
i bought a smaller version of this bag at a local retail store and love it . when i upgraded my phone , the cell was a lot bigger than the compartment on the smaller phone . i decided it was time to upgrade , i couldn ' t find the bag in retail stores , but found it online . amazon as usual had the best price , so i hemmed and hawed over it and finally decided to get it . i love this bag ! ! ! ! i can fit everything in this bag - cell , water bottle , kindle , wallet , tissue packs , pens , ipod , candy , and i could probably the kitchen sink if i had too ! here hee love this bag ! ! ! ! ! ! 
steel blue color was lighter than shown , but not objectionable . well - planned out pockets . sturdy lightly crinkled nylon fabric . double - zipper pulls on main compartment and exterior compartment , thanks for that ! design works well for those who wear sling bags across the right shoulder . small zip pocket on shoulder strap very tight fit for iphone , would hinder quick accessibility . watch the abrasive pin - sharp pseudo - velcro on the outside pocket flap . like , yowee ouch ! ! ! removed easily with seam ripper . fits ipad with folio cover easily . minus a star for lack of some padding on the back side or bottom . all in all , useful for everyday and travel . 
great bag but lost a star because once you adjust the straps to fit your body size perfectly , they simply do not stay in place . they fall to to the largest size strap length all the time . drives me nuts . other than that , great bag . 
i had a number of day bags but none that seemed to do it all . i was tired of forgetting things i needed in another purse when i switched for other outings . i wanted something that would work to shop , travel , walk to grocery store , go on walk with dogs , run errands , quick trip to gym , etc . i am a short gal at 5 ' 4 & # 34 ; and it fits comfortably . i saw this at bed ba and beyond but even with my 20 % off , it was still way more than i wanted to spend and was glad to find an amazon vendor that had it for half the price ! what i like : 1 . comfy strap ! lots of cushion to avoid shoulder fatigue . 2 . velcro pocket on side big enough for iphone5 or smartphone in otterbox . 3 . water bottle pocket , now given it only fits 20 oz and smaller , i don ' t need a gallon of water in my purse4 . secret pocket in strap5 . lots of pocked and space6 . organizational pocket with slot for pen and cardsi was able to purge 4 bags because this 1 is so awesome ! ! ! ! 
i liked this bag and the features of all the compartments . but , i returned it because of how thick it became when i filled the compartments . sturdy looking construction . just too large for my smaller frame and back issues . 
i bought this purse / bag for a trip to disney world . i am using it as an every day purse now to get used to it prior to our trip . it holds a lot ! i like it a lot . there is only one issue i have with it . the strap does not stay 100 % tight when i adjust it shorter . but overall , i think it was a good purchase . 
another medium sized baggallini that completes my collection . i can carry the nook , water , sunglasses , and a planner / notebook along with essentials without look bulky and laden . i like the substantial strap . great for cross - body for errands and travel . 
i love my baggallini messenger bag . just ordered my second after one of the zippers wore out on the first one i purchsed ( after 5 + years of daily use , the bag itself is still in good condition ) . this is an amazingly utilitarian bag made of very strong fabric with many sections and pockets to hold your essentials and more . and the cross - shoulder feature with the padded strap is so comfortable , you hardly know you have it on . i highly recommend this bag for hiking , shopping , going to the park , as a convenient grab - and - run diaper bag , or anytime you need to have your hands free . 
it ' s sturdy and practical and shockingly large - in a pinch , i can throw my enormous ( ladies size 10 ) trekking shoes in it . it doesn ' t look that big , but it is . i just wish all the colors had been priced the same so that i could have gotten something other than blah navy . 
as with the other reviews , i found the strap re - adjusted constantly during wearing ( i had to put stitches through the strap to keep it in place ) . also , the bag had a tendency to slide around a bit , probably because of the fabric . it does have a lot of storage , which is great . allow plenty of time for delivery ( took longer than i expected , and much longer than the usual prompt amazon delivery ) . 
i purchased this bag for way too much money at a local travel shop while i was holiday shopping one year . i was intrigued by the story of how the baggalini bags were created and i really think that the entire line is brilliant . this is by far my favorite bag , though . i have it in 5 colors now . pros : it ' s an adjustable cross - body , which is far more secure and less prone to purse - snatchers . it can fit an ipad in a thick otterbox case , as well as my giant target - clasp wallet . the additional front pocket has pen holders and small pockets for things like insurance or business cards . the front strap has a zippered compartment for smaller items / work badges or a small telephone . the colors ! each bag is exactly the same , regardless of the color . they can be thrown right into the washer when they need a good cleaning ! con : i haven ' t found one yet , after years of usage now . i think that once you switch over to the baggalini brand , which is in my opinion the most practical and useful bag series for busy women , i think it ' ll be very hard for you to go back ! 
pluses : ipad mini in its case fits nicely with more space for my iphone , ipod touch , wallet and external battery rechargerfits comfortably over my right shoulderwhile sitting on my shoulder , all pockets and zippers face upward rather than sideways like many mono sling bagscuteminuses : material feels flimsy ( hence the rating . . . not sure if it will hold up ) no firm basei searched high and low for the perfect sized mono sling . fitting the mini , as well as a few minor objects as i mentioned was a major consideration . most bags were either too small , flimsy or too large for my needs . this fits the bill except for the material , so , i am just hoping and praying that this is it . trying to lighten my load . . . am not the sort of woman who crowds my bag with nonsense . essentials are all that i need . i don ' t feel like searching anymore , so , i hope to change my rating . 
the bag is nice , but just did not fit my needs . it is an okay bag for short day trips and i required more space in a bag . 
i have a couple other bags from the same maker , so i knew i would be pleased as i am now . i bought this particular bag as an alternative to a larger shoulder bag . the straps adjust easily and fits very well . easy to open zippers with nice compartments . it has a lot of great compartments for keys , cell phone , i . d . cards , kleenex , make up , and pretty anything you may want or need for a trip or day trip . 
very nice bag . the outer pocket does not match the picture . : ( not quite big enough for what i wanted though . i kept it but i really needed a bag to take on the plane with me . . . . so tired of heavy back packs . i ended up with the patagonia minimass . the baggallini just wasn ' t big enough for all these items : ipad , full size bose headphones , a paperback book , small toiletries bag , glasses case and odds and ends . 
i am always on a quest for the most comfortable , cute shoe and most practical bag . this may be it ! i have several baggalinis and like them all ; however , i do find that the interior fabric in this bag pulls apart fairly easily . we ' ll see how this one does . 
i got this bag as a gift and it ' s been my travel companion ever since . its many compartments keep belongings organized and easily accessible , and i always know where everything is . since compartments are all zippered , everything is secure . another advantage is that it ' s discrete enough to double as a handbag ( my sling bag is black ) , so no need to stuff extra weight in my suitcase . the nylon is rugged and resistant , zippers are good quality . i should know : i ' ve been using this bag a lot and not being exactly kind to it . i don ' t have any clanging zippers , but did find that the adjustable strap keeps slipping through the metal holder ( i like the bag at waist length , close to the body , and the strap is long ) , perhaps because the nylon it is made of is so smooth . i solved this by getting a cheap metal barrette and closing it around the strap right below the holder ( it works ! ) . another interesting aspect is that the bag is a lot more comfortable to carry when slung over the right shoulder - - not made for lefties ! i ' m a lefty , but this doesn ' t bother me . 
this bag is wonderful ! serves the purpose i need . while i like other messengers i have used , this one fits me the best ! 
fits very very well and is great under skirts in warm weather . great for traveling as they wash and dry quickly . they are surprisingly durable in spite of how thin and light and sheer they are . 
on gossamer mesh panties are the perfect material for travel and for everyday . they wash easily by hand , are very lightweight and dry fast . the elastic trim and waist band is as flat as possible and there is barely any panty line for a non - thong . plus they are available in a range of basic and seasonal colours . sizing tends to run large as the material is so stretchy ( but never slouchy ) and this hi - cut style is exactly as the name describes ; it is very high cut . regular torso ladies will find that the waistband falls at the belly button or just slightly below . ladies with longer torsos will find that this sits an inch below the belly button . petite ladies should order 1 size down . these panties are quite delicate and care needs to be taken when donning and doffing to avoid poking a fingernail through the mesh fabric . handwashing is best [ why not , since it is so easy ? ] and dryers = immensely decreased lifespan if not instant death . 
perfect skin color panty to wear under scrub pants , comfortable and non bindings legs and waist bands , only kind i wear 
these are wonderful panties . they are very sheer , though , so don ' t expect to wear these dozens of times like your cotton hanes . high waisted but high thigh , i love them ! 
the material feels so goodholds everything in placesuper comfygreat panties for a guylove the colorsa lot better than mens boring underwear 
in over 50 years of carrying handbags of every shape and style , the baggallini wallet bagg is far and away my favorite . i ' ve had two for years and have even thrown them in the washing machine a time or two with no ill effects . they offer such great organization and easy access to all your needs when you ' re going through a busy check - out counter or need a quick touch - up . i just wish they made one in leather for a little dressier look . 
great quality and size . wipes clean . trusted brand . this bag has been all over the world and never failed . holds a lot . 
i gave it a 5 - star review even though i returned it . it is very high quality , but was too small for my needs . 
i have two kinds of purses - - smallish and luggage . the smaller purses go everywhere , but the larger bags often stay in the car or under the desk , while the bare necessities go into the grocery store or to lunch in a wristlet . wristlets , however , are often too small . this bag is the perfect compromise . plenty of room for whatever you think of as the bare necessities , but still light & small enough to go in a carry - on , backpack , briefcase or hobo bag with plenty of room for other stuff . also , while this bag has card slots and two zipper pouches inside to use as a wallet , i prefer putting my actual wallet inside . it is a single - fold wallet . when open , it fits perfectly in this little purse . i love this thing . i will be doing a wristlet inventory soon . most of them will be going to the consignment shop . 
this purse has many pockets , but beware if you have a fat wallet . it has sections for credit cards and other cards but they are too shallow , and fall out . the cell phone pocket on the outside fits my iphone 4 + case perfectly . there are two zipper middle pockets inside for mirror , etc . if you are the kind who likes to throw water bottles , sunscreen in your purse this is not the purse for you . anything large / thick makes the purse look awkward and bulky . i do like this purse but mine arrived with the white lining showing , and it was dirty so i returned . i would have kept it if not for the nylon fabric . i hate the feeling of nylon against my skin , and as much as i tried to like the nylon i couldn ' t do it . overall a good design , needs a few improvements . i just wish baggalini would make purses in something other then nylon ! 
i love this purse . i have long been on the search for the perfect small purse and this is it ! i have 3 now in different colors . it is sturdy , well made and can be worn so many way . carrying a large purse gives me neck and shoulder ache . this purse holds all my essentials in an organized , easy to find manner with the individuals pockets and it is not too heavy , not too small , not too large . 
this is my second baggallini of this size . it holds a lot and is not heavy to carry over the shoulder . i extend the strap and put over my head and across my body this leaves both hands free and the bag secure . i don ' t use all the pockets , but they come in handy for a small tape measure and a pill case . this is the height of function . 
i wanted to love this bag - it seems perfect . . . . until you use it . everything is just not quite what it needs to be . 1st - the fabric is wonderfully lightweight , but then the zippers fobs are all ( there are a lot of them ) so heavy that it makes the bag about twice as heavy as it needed to be . then , the inside is so odd : it looks like you have great sections and separated areas - but they aren ' t really separate or fully enclosed . the two sections with zippers are not sewn to the bottom of the bag , meaning that anything small you think you have placed in one of the open sections is free to slide under the zippered pouch to another section . even weirder - the sides are also not secured to the bottom of the purse , so if you unzip the sides all the way down stuff can slide out the edges too . you aren ' t going to lose anything large - but don ' t expect pens , change , or anything smaller than a marble to stay inside if you aren ' t diligent . the final issue is the strap - it is slippery , so i found i had to wear it cross - body all the time or it would slide off of my shoulder . it is such a shame , because i love the size of this purse and had high hopes for it - but in actual use it is too high maintenance . 
just okay . i wanted a really small nose ring that i could wear to work . i had to cut the bar because it was too long and you obviously cannot wear the back in your nose . it only stayed in for a few days because the ball is so small that it can be pulled through the piercing . i wouldn ' t recommend . 
i needed it in emergency situation as i lost my nose piercing and i am so fussy about the size so i am grateful for the fast delivery of this item . . 
the balls on these earrings are too small . they are barely larger than the posts , so as a result , the earrings pull through the ears and fall out the back . 
when they say small , it is an understatement . but it ' s just want i wanted . small enough to be seen and not seen . ordered it for my cartilage . this is great if you have a nose piercing ( which i don ' t ) and you don ' t want to draw attention to it . 
these studs are very tiny . i bought them to go in my second set of holes and on one side i was able to pull the earring too far and it disappeared . i couldn ' t get it to come out the back so i ' m not afraid of losing them . i immediately replaced the back that came on them with clear rubber plastic ones because the original backs were so hard to get off . within minutes they made my ears start itching , but i used some rubbing alcohol and they are fine now . they say sterling silver , but i think they are just plated not solid sterling silver , so don ' t expect them to last . for now they look cut though . 
i ' m very happy with my key largo sunglasses . i find them very comfortable . along with the key largos , i ordered a pair of flying fisherman kingston sunglasses , and for some crazy reason , they made the ends of the temple arms on that model very pointy , so they actually cause discomfort when they ' re put on . the key largos don ' t have that issue at all , and they are thin behind the ear . i can ' t stand sunglasses that i can feel pushing my ears out the whole time i ' m wearing them . i was hesitant to order amber lenses , but the lenses on these sunglasses aren ' t so yellow that it takes any getting used to . color vision isn ' t significantly altered when wearing them . with every other pair of sunglasses i ' ve owned recently , i had to remove them to view lcd screens ( gas pumps , atms , etcetera ) . with the key largos , i ' ve found that i can keep them on more often under such circumstances . the lenses are not on par with premium optics , but they ' re quite good for the price range . the rubber on the temples really helps keep them in place . i put a tiny amount of silicone / teflon lubricant on the hinges to make the temple arms move more easily . i ' m nuts like that . ) i don ' t understand the extent to which people are complaining about the size of these sunglasses . i do not have a small head ( i just measured my head and it ' s 23 . 0 " around at my forehead - - which is a men ' s large hat size ) , and i have no problem with the key largo sunglasses . sure they could be a bit bigger , but i never even had that thought before seeing the complaints here . as i write this i ' ve been using them daily for seven months , and they ' ve held up fine . i think they ' re great . the price is just icing on the cake . i ordered a second pair . 
i really like the flying fisherman glasses - great value , great materials , durable , excellent polarization . this model is very small , like for kids & petite ladies . otherwise , nice glasses 
my 9 year old son has sensitive eyes , he always wears sunglasses outside , and of course he loses them frequently . i like him to have polarized because it reduces glare , but not too expensive . these look great on him , fit him well and he says he likes them as they are & # 34 ; dark & # 34 ; enough . 
they are way too small for my face but they still feel relatively comfortable for the five minutes i ' ve worn them . i ' ll keep them because it isn ' t worth the hassle of shipping them back for the low price i paid for them . besides my wife thinks i look like i ' m wearing a pair of glasses that belong to my 7 year old son and it makes her laugh . so they get an extra star for the comedy factor . if you have a big head like me then these are probably not for you . 
i ' m used to ray bans but kept scratching the lenses and got sick and tired of spending $ 70 each time i needed a new pair of sunglasses . bought these and wore them for about one day . too tight , too flimsy , lenses look weird , things are distorted . they probably are great glasses for someone , just not me . 
i really enjoy these nicely fitting , advanced polarized sunglasses . they are especially great for those sunny fishing days as they help your clear vision cut through any surface reflection ; they allow you to see deep into the water ! 
these would not fit someone with a pumpkin head . they are on the small side . fit my husband just fine . they look like nice expensive sunglasses . 
i don ' t like , to small for my head , and no i do not have a big head it is average . . . . . ly larger but not as big as you think . 
much better than the last pair of disposable sunglasses i bought . the frames are very light and thin but i ' m hoping they ' ll last a while despite that . my biggest concern with these was the fit - i saw some reviewers complaining about the size and fit . they look like normal sunglasses to me and i think they ' re very comfortable . really comfortable actually - the rubber on the nose and frame part behind the ears is a plus in my opinion . i know more sunglasses are doing that these days and i like it . the rubber or silicone helps them stay put on my head if i ' m biking . if they last a few months at least - i ' d buy another pair . these are a good value at this price . fyi : there ' s no case or anything extra - not that i expected it - they come in a plastic bag . but , so did my last pair . i moved to disposable sunglasses after my last pair of awesome and expensive glasses mysteriously disappeared . 
these would be 5 - star sunglasses if it weren ' t for the large , silver " flying fisherman " logo on the side of the glasses . i have never understood why companies think we want these . sigh . regardless , they fit well and are good quality otherwise . 
when you see this clear image you will get a nice impression on this glasses and it ' s price even it is affordable and cheap little bit but not to level what actual i get . the pairs of glasses that i got 2 $ is too much on them because they are too small looks fit for children only and it ' s plastic material is irritant for my skin because it was too rough . i like the flying fisherman but not this one . 
i bought these sunglasses for my 13 - year - old grandson . he liked the style , and the fit is okay . the quality of the plastic is about the same as a pair of little children ' s sunglasses . my biggest complaint , however , is that the lenses keep falling out . they fell out just taking them out of the plastic wrapper . i put them back in and then tried to wipe them clean . out they popped again . if i had bought them for myself i would have sent them back already . i ' m still deciding whether or not to ask my grandson for them back so i can return them . i ' m sure they ' ll be a real hassle to wear with one lens or the other always popping out . i can ' t recommend them . 
these have quickly become my favorite sun glasses . i don ' t use them for fishing , just driving and yardwork . i will definitely buy them again . 
i admit i bought 2 pair because i liked the look . yeah & # 34 ; duh ! & # 34 ; . i took a chance and it paid off . the fit is good even for my big head . i feel they can make anyone look cool . cuts down on the glare very good . i am using these for daily walks . light weight and fit great . no moving or falling off . color is niiiice . glad i bought 2 pair : - ) 
i only wear sunglasses with amber or vermillion lenses and prefer polorized if possible . this pair is a little small but a nice fit . . . . the lens clarity and color a wonderful . they are scratch resistant . the logo is a bit much but not horrible . but for the price , you can ' t beat these . 
these are great sunglasses for the price . these are very comfortable , seem well made , and have good visual characteristics , however , they are a bit small for the average male face . still , at this price i am keeping them as a back - up pair . 
i thought i ordered a cheap - o plastic fireman hat for my son , but this is a hard , durable product . well worth the minimal price for this ! 100 % guarantee this product ! ! 
my son had gone through several other hats in a matter of months , they would crack and break . this hat is made of very sturdy material and has held up much better . he loves it . 
when we visited the local fire station , we took this hat and the fire truck with us . firemen are our heroes . the firemen liked the similarity and switched hats with my son ( he was very proud to help ) . it is light , it is size - adjustable , the color is bright . like it . recommend it . 
purchased this book to go with a toy firetruck and fireman story book . the three year old i purchased these for loves them . 
the fireman hat we got was not like the one in the picture . it ' s very poor quality . the sticker in the front is not as attractive as the one in the picture . it ' s a small round sticker that says " fire chief " on it that is extremely cheap looking . actually the sticker has been halfway unstuck from the hat from the day we got it . even the plastic is flimsy . maybe a nice hat shipped with this at one point in time but the hat that is being shipped now is not the same hat and it isn ' t worth buying . 
boughtt his product to complete a fireman halloween costume . it was the right price and actually very durable for the price . is has an adjustable plastic band on the inside so the hat can fit even the smallest of heads . my son has complained that sometimes his hair gets stuck in the band and pulls when he takes the hat off . 
i choose this rating because this little mans firehat is so darn cute , and now he can pretendhe is a fireman when he plays with his firetruck 
i agree with a previous reviewer . it did not fit my 18 month old ' s head . granted , he has a rather big head , but as one of the previous reviewers stated , it won ' t fit a 3 yr old with a head circumference in the 50th percentile range ( which is where my kid ' s head is if you went across the growth chart ) . i bought it because it said it was for kids 3 and up , so i thought it would fit my son ' s head . oh well . the search continues . in terms of durability , it seems rather sturdy and heavy , so i ' d imagine it would last quite a while . it ' s made out of hard plastic . 
i got this for my kids to wear when they are playing with the matchbox smokey fire truck . they just love trucks . 
great product , nice quality , very pleased with the material and colors . the ears are some what flexible which was nice to make them look a tad bit more life like , over all very good product . 
i bought this hat because i was going to be the rabbit in alice in wonderland and it worked out great ! very cute and fun . 
i added lights within the ears . that made my hat shine for new years . personally i love the the better quality the elope company puts in to their products . if you have the option , buy elope for the few dollars more . you ' ll be glad you did ! 
i got this as a joke for my niece for christmas and the quality is really good and the hat is super cute . 
this hat is awesome and loads of fun to wear . . . . i ' ve got an adult head size and the hats fits perfect and comfy . . . . . it ' s the year of the rabbit , which is me and i wear this hat to all sorts of functions and it ' s hold up very nicely 
this white rabbit topper was of excellent quality and easy to wear . we received many compliments on it during our play . 
i buy elope hats because they are fun & excellent quality ! i recommend this hat to anyone ! the fit is always great & you will be a show stopper ! i wear my collection of hat ' s daily while driving school bus and kid ' s & adult ' s love them ! elope hat ' s are my favorite ' s out of my collection ! 
looks really convincing and easy to alter . nice material and the metallic painted buttons distract the eye from seeing the edge of the vinyl boot top against the shoe itself . if you can ' t get a faux leather pair of boots then this is the next best thing . 
great ! looked awesome for a john smith costume . the are not too big which is great ! thank you for a great product ! 
these looks and worked great . only problem was they got hot . my husband liked them and found them easy to work . his friends had bought others and they ended up fighting the ones they had bought to keep them up . these work great 
these boot tops look great . one of the buttons was falling off , but it was an easy fix . the boot tops are knee high and fit great . several people thought i was wearing actual boots . 
1st of all it came folded over several times which left un - removable creases in the material . 2nd the tops of the & # 34 ; boots & # 34 ; were large enough to fit around my waist which looked ridiculous around my legs . 3rd . the elastic straps on the bottom that are designed to wrap around your shoes are so short that when i wrapped them under my foot - no shoe on - they scrunched up my foot and it started to fall asleep . no way that would ever fit over any pair of shows i own . very poorly made . 
my husband bought these to wear to a pirate mardi gras ball . we also noticed several other gentlemen wearing the same type of boot tops . they held up well and fit great ! my husband has very wide calves and we were pleasantly surprised they fit as well as they did - and stayed up ! great addition to his pirate costume ! ! ! 
these toppers were used at the renaissance fair and they made my husbands costume complete . 
these were a perfect addition to the costume . no one knew they were covers . definitely wear them with slip on shoes and place them on the shoe before putting them on . it makes it easier . 
i wore these with some old black loafers i hadn ' t worn in years . along with some black , crushed velvet leggings and these boot toppers looked like the real thing . people at every party were coming up to me all night saying they loved my boots . i only told a few people they were fake so i really had fun feeling even more like a pirate when people thought i had real boots . with the right outfit i could probably even get away with wearing them out to eat . 
works real well for what i need them for . multi uses with costumes for different occasions . they fit and look great 
i ' m glad that other reviewers had prepared me for these and given suggestions on how to use them . i had the same experience that they had - - - very hard to get the shoe in , and had to secure the tops to my pants to keep them up . i placed my shoe in first from the top and set it in place . when i put them on , i slid my legs down into the boot tops and shoes all at once . as far as securing the tops , i used large safety pins , two on each boot top , under the cuff . held them like a charm , and didn ' t hurt the boot tops or my pants . they really did look good , and really made my costume ( along with the parrot i had affixed to my shoulder with magnets ) . 
i bought these to go with my pirate costume . i wear a size 12 shoe and had a very hard time getting them over my shoes but i was careful and didn ' t rip anything . i ' ve removed one star because in order to keep them looking good , you must safety pin or tape them to your pants , otherwise , like others have said , they will droop down and sit around your ankles . other than that , they look great . button detail is good , the laces look excellent . it ' s nice to be able to wear any ol ' pair of comfortable dress shoes and they look like awesome pirate boots ! 
so happy . i had two days notice to put together a pirate costume for a member of my family . one trip to the goodwill to buy over - sized black pants and a billowy shirt was all it took - locally . however , these boot tops , and the eye patch that i bought on amazon really made the outfit look authentic . yes , prime worked for me - these arrived in two days as promised ! skip the hat ( reviewed elsewhere ) and go with a bright asian print scarf or bandanna on the head to complete the outfit . 
great for costume ; not stiff enough to stand alone so need additional elastic or pins to keep them up . otherwise fine and definitely the right price ! 
these covers looked great with my husband ' s victorian vampire costume . he did have a little trouble getting them on , if i remember correctly he had to put them on first and them put on his boots and pull the covers down over them . he could not get them on if he put the boots on first . 
adult prestige deluxe vinyl boot tops - for pirate costumes , renaissance . . . ; possibly the nicest boot overs i have come across . not cheesy or easily damaged 
i ' m a fairly big man with thick calves and despite trying to get the laces as tight as possible i couldn ' t keeps these up on my legs . they looked good , but i finally had to do what many others did and pin them to my pants . 
so it seemed like such a good idea , but if you try to slip this over a zip - up boot , there ' s no way to either get it over the boot once it ' s on , or zip up the boot if you try to put it on the boot before putting it onto your foot . sad and disappointed pirates , we were : ( it * might * work over a shoe . dunno . 
with the right black shoes , these are nearly indistinguishable from real boots , and much cheaper ! worked just like i wanted , though i had to safety pin them to my pants because the tops are a little loose and the white inside was showing , but that was not problem . much cheaper and easier than buying boots , and should certainly serve for many costume parties or theater performances . 
so i got these to compliment my black cowboy boots ; however they will not work with hightop / calf boots . they are designed to work with a dress shoe or something similar . so in round two of testing i said " i will put these on first , and then put my boot / shoe on " then i found where my problem was . they fit very snug on me . . . . on my bare skin . my calf ( which is all muscle , i might add ) is 20 . 5 / 21 " just below the knee ( 3 - 4 " below ) and these things were skin tight . which presents a small problem since i need to tuck my pant into them . so measure your calves to see if these will even fit on you ! anything below 18 " these should work for you . so why still 4 stars ? easy . i wear my cowboy boots , and slide them down inside ( so that the cuff / top cover my boots giving the illusion of my original boots being pirate boots . work for me just fine ! gonna wear these with my pirate costume for both halloween and the alestorm concert next month ! 
the elastic at the bottom just tears right off once you get the boot on . but really its not needed to make the boots look good . 
watch is nice and i was able to size it down to fit my small wrists . stylish and yet simple . 
pleasantly surprised when i opened the box . this is a very attractive timepiece . i purchased this watch to give to a friend for christmas . i hope she will like it . 
i have many watches of different price ranges and i found this one to be fairly priced for a great watch . light weight and comfortable on the wrist . highly recommend it . 
i bought this watch to replace one i have had for a couple of years and broke . i was so happy to find the very same watch here on amazon . this watch was and is just perfect for my needs as i wear both silver and gold jewelry . the size is just right . . . not too big or too small . looks great with jeans or dressing up a bit . 
smaller than i expected . but the design is real pretty . a great dress watch , or an almost - everyday - watch to use for work if you work in an office . 
great comfortable shoes at a great price . i get lots of compliments on the style ! aj 
i was looking for the citywalk midnight sketcher shoes item 60488 blk , and found this item when searching . i was originally concerned because the price was about half the price i have paid on other websites , and the description was goofy " sketchers men ' s midnight bike toe oxford " didn ' t sound like what i was looking for . i decided to take a chance and am happy that i did ! these were exactly the shoes i was looking for ! for those that state that the grips on the bottom fall off , i can not speak to this exact order , but my boyfriend has been wearing these shoes for years and yes , the bumps do wear down ( we have never had the problem with them falling off ) , and he typically buys a new pair every year . he is on his feet 8 + hours a day so that is what i would expect . if you think these shoes are going to last you for years with moderate to heavy use , you will be disappointed . but when you do wear them , they are extremely comfortable and are the only shoe my boyfriend likes to wear . updated 11 / 26 pm hours . . . so i looked on a box from last year compared to this recent purchase , and the only difference is that these shoes are made in cambodia , not in china , like my older box shows . i emailed sketchers to verify these are not an inferior quality product and they do have plants in cambodia . i guess i am just being overly paranoid since the price is half of what i have paid in the past . will update again when i get a response . 
i got these as a christmas present for my boyfriend so he ' d have something that would be a cross between a casual and a dress shoe . they fit well and were more comfortable than his beat - up sneakers . they are very well - made and after 8 months of wearing them , he still loves them and they look brand - new . i would definitely buy them again ! 
this is my third pair . each one that i have had lasted me close to two years of virtually every day use . i know it is time for a new pair when the inside lining wears through and the knobs on the sole are worn down to the surrounding material and even disappearing . often , models of shoes are discontinued ( probably for fashion reasons ) after a year or two . glad to see that these continue to be produced unchanged . i hope this post doesn ' t jinx that ! 
if you typically wear a size 11 then go with 10 . 5 cause these are a little big . on that note these feel great . the leather lining is great and the look is perfect for black or brown . 
bought this for my son ' s birthday at a discounted price at amazon . he ' s worn them previously and really likes them . 
these are used as my ' indoor ' shoes and they are very comfortable and have held up well . i ' ll order them again . 
shoe fit well and had a very comfortable cushiony innersole . outer shoe was very inflexible . attractive to look at but looked a clunky on my size 10 1 / 2 foot . i returned it and bought a more flexible walking shoe . 
i bought these after reading all the good reviews . i have bought easy spirit previously , just not this style . i am on my feet all day and these were not as comfortable as i expected . i even put insoles in them thinking that would help . . . not the case . they are still a nice shoe but nothing i can stand in all day . they are true to size and fit well but not the comfort level i was looking for . 
i purchased two pairs of this style in different accent colors . the one pair is still in its box in the closet and i wear this & # 34 ; multi - color & # 34 ; all the time . it ' s difficult to see but the & # 34 ; multi - color & # 34 ; means that the sole and side stripe are a dark navy blue on white leather but the fabric loops for the laces are a dark green . i have neuropathy in my feet so i look for the most supporting comfortable shoes i can find . i ' ve always been a fan of easy spirit , i ' ve purchased several over the years . this pair that i ' m reviewing is the result of my satisfaction with the first pair of & # 34 ; multi - colored & # 34 ; shoes in that they are the third pair of this design . . . . i wouldn ' t want to need another pair and have them no longer available . in fact , now i ' m tempted to buy yet another pair . a person cannot be too cautious about some things . 
great shoes i spend lots of hours standing great shoes comfortable from day one i will buy again ! thank you ! 
i had been looking for easy spirit leather walkers to replace ones which i have worn and washed for nearly 8 years . i couldn ' t find them in the stores . finally i found the ones i needed on amazon . they are true to size and last a long time . i had bought another label here on amazon and didn ' t really like them , but kept them because i couldn ' t find the easy spirit i truly wanted . now i am finally satisfied . good work , amazon ! ! 
these shoes are good for people with wide feet . these shoes are good for people who stand long hours . these shoes are made in china and don ' t last long . 
i have been looking for a comfortable , lightweight sneaker to take on an overseas trip where we will be doing a fair amount of sightseeing . these sneakers fit the bill . they are the most comfortable sneakers i have ever owned . i have been wearing them on my 2 to 3 mile daily walks and the shoes provide the right amount of support . the leather tops are soft and keep my feet cool . i also like the fact that they only weight 9 . 6 oz . most of my other sneakers are much heavier and after prolonged use leave my feet and legs feeling fatigued . overall these sneakers are an excellent walking shoe . 
the cushioning and arch support are perfect for me . right now i use them only on weekends when i can wear jeans / shorts . 
these shoes really are great . my aunt does not wear sneakers since it is hard to find wide shoes that fit comfortably . . . and then i found easy spirit ' s romy sneakers . she tried them on and she said they are so comfortable . her feet were swollen and they still fit inside the wide shoes . she told me it feels like she is not wearing shoes and she was very happy with them . i greatly recommend this purchase . 
these are nice - looking shoes . i got the 8 c / d . i couldn ' t quite say that it fit a bit large , but it is a little roomy in the heel area . the rest is all perfect . i was nervous about buying shoes online , so i ' m pretty relieved . as another reviewer said , these are not made for hard - core walkers , just everyday here and there walking . they ' re very light - weight , and the heel isn ' t real high . 
these are my first easy spirit sneakers and i really like them . they are very lightweight and cushy . i like the laces as well - they are sort of an elastic with plenty of give , but they stay in place . i wanted a pair of shoes i could wear instead of riding boots when just working around the barn ( and not riding , these are not suitable for riding ) . as the summer wears on boots get very hot to wear for long periods . these sneakers have been good at keeping my feet comfortable in 100 degree temps so far . additionally , they don ' t slip and the width is perfect with socks . i would totally buy these again at some point . 
had to walk up to the post office to pick up package and didn ' t even wait to get home to open the package . opened it up took a peak inside to check if they were the sneakers i ordered . they were . when i finally got home i tried my sneakers out and took a walk in them around the block walking my pet and i love them . i would order another pair from this buyer . thank you ! 
these are really nice shoes . i wanted a clean cut pair of white shoes . i am not into gaudy , glow in the dark sneakers and these fit the bill . really comfortable and look nice . i love them . 
this was a good buy for the money . i found that the fit was fine and the shoe looks well . this will be good for the long walk and workout in the gym . well worth it ! 
i liked the look of these but the minute i put one on it went right back in the box . i ordered my regular size 8 . 5 wide and although the width was fine the length was not . my toe immediate hit the front of the shoe when i put it on . i was sad . i really wanted to get walking ! ! guess it is iffy ordering shoes online but sometimes you hit it lucky . this was just not not of those times . 
since i have wide and small feet , i was actually able to buy shoes that weren ' t 1 or 2 sizes larger ! the extra widths that these shoes are available in made it possible to get the perfect sizing . ahhhh , relief ! ! i will definitely buy more . thank you ! 
lightweight and roomy . very comfortable shoe . would hightly recommend to walking enthusiasts . also a stylish looking shoe and can be worn casually . 
these shoes are very light and comfortable and fit very well . i walk a lot and they will be enjoyed ! 
i probably should have bought 4 pairs and then picked the best one pair . the last time i bought this shoe , however , i had good luck the first time . so i loved the shoe and it lasted a really long time . i wore it at the gym only and when it wore down a little with less cushioning , i got a spenco total support insert for it and its good to go again . i wanted to try a new pair but it may have just my bad luck as they were too narrow in the toe box unlike my older pair so i sent them back and kept my old ones with my new inserts . 
the moment i put the shoes on , was well pleased . so comfortable . been wearing for a few hours and they feel like an old friend already . the size was perfect . i like these much better than the new balance just purchased for the same price . it was past time for my old nikes and the fit and feel of these shoes make me wonder what took so long to get new shoes . athletic shoes are ridicules in price , these are so reasonable , was concerned the quality might be second rate or fit oddly . i ' m tempted to get another pair , but i have exceeded my budget for shoes . & # 8203 ; 
i ' ve heard / read so many great things over the years about easy spirit and really liked the idea that this walking shoe was available in c / d width . for me , however , the avia walker is better simply because the sole has more cushion . on my feet for hours at a clip , i also added my usual tri - comfort and ball of foot inserts just because . so far , my feet are much happier . i could have saved these easy spirit ' s as a secondary pair , but the avia ' s also cost a couple of bucks less . i ' ll give the avia ' s a couple more weeks before deciding on whether or not they are my " new " shoe . 
i gets these all the time . only ones that dont hurt my feet , and i always get compliments on them . 
romy is perfect for the 10 - 15 miles i walk every week . the roomy toe box allows my toes to move as they should when doing fast paced walking . if the toe box lacks height , my toes rub on the inside top of the shoe causing soreness and sometimes blisters . that doesn ' t happen with these . i used to wear punter but these are much better for my problem . do i love them ? sure do . this is my third pair ! . 
fit is as expected - - due to no wide shoe option available on the day that we purchased these we were forced to go up a size to hopefully get a wide enough shoe . so the shoe is longer than it should be but fits okay in width ( still a little snug ) but is is a similiar shoe to my wife ' s previous easy spirit that she loved and that have lasted a long time , but alas , everything good wears out . . . and it seems that one can never find the same thing again . anyway , they look to be good shoes and they are functional so she hopes to get years of wear out of them like she did her previous pair of easy spirits . 
these shoes are so comfortable . i am on my feet all day . lots of walking involved in my job and standing in one position . feel like pillows under my feet . 
i been wearing this brand of shoe for a couple years now . i knew what size to order and it fits as expected . i have high arches and get heel spurs , this shoe seems to be comfortable for me to wear . i wear it for work , home nursing , and need a comfy shoe . . . 
i bought these about 4 years ago from a jc penney . i have bought several tennis shoes or walking shoes since that are just not as comfy so i tried to find these and couldn ' t . i found on amazon and they look and fit the same except that the right heel seems a tiny bit more loose . still these are my favorite comfy shoe so i am pleased . i have bought more expensive shoes that are not as comfy . 
this was a christmas present for my mother - in - law , she said they were very comfortable and fit true to size . they appear to be very well made with good arch support and moderate cushioning thru out . 
for the low price these are a great pair of casual sneakers . very comfortable ! surely will buy a pair of these again 
this shoe is probably the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn . i can wear it all day long , with no discomfort . i normally have some problems with my back and feet . . . . . . . not the case with these shoes . i wear a wide shoe , and this is just great . lots of room in the toe box , no rubbing anywhere 
bought these for my mom as she needd a good pair of sneakers . i havent heard any complaints so the must be good . she is 74 and likes the looks as well . easy spirit is a god shoe . 
these shoes seem very good quality . however , they are a bit hot , because they don ' t breathe . and they aren ' t the most comfortable shoes ever . 
this shoe fits well and is comfortable . it stays on your heels , doesn ' t slide up and down . very sturdy for walking 
i had a pair of these shoes for a long long time . i needed a new pair and these were exactly like the ones i was used to have . i have neuropathy in my feet and legs and need soft , comfy and wide shoes . these are the best ! i would reccomend them to anyone with problem feet . they are cute too . 
i have tried many walking shoes over time . this shoe fits me best and is the most comfortable shoe out of so many shoes i have purchased . i wear this when i know i am going to be on my feet and need comfort . 
these are the only shoes that i can fast walk in . i walk 5 miles a day . after a while other shoes tend to rub my feet . the romy have plenty of room , a thick cushioning and are very well made . i love them . i wore the last pair i had for 1 year and hated to throw them away because they were still comfortable . but i figured that after a year it was time to get a new pair . you can ' t go wrong with these shoes . 
these sneakers feel a little cheaper than i thought they would . i wonder if i had tried them on in a store if i would have purchased them ? they just don ' t seem to be the quality i expected after all the terrific reviews . they are comfortable and true to size . i will keep them . 
i have worn many different brands , but in my opinion these are the best . they support the foot , my feet never hurt when i wear these . they look good on the foot and don ' t wear out , like many other brands . i have purchased many pairs of these and will continue to do so . 
i have several easy spirit shoes ordered in past few years . this shoe does not have the quality that my older ones have . i think it may have been made in china . runs smaller than my other es shoes , returned 
i have been wearing these sneakers for over 10 years . the last two pair that i ordered did not work for me . it took me a while to realize that if i wore them too long the sneakers caused my back to hurt . just another one of those products that builds a great reputation and then lets the consumer down by lowering their standards 
i really liked these - they fit nice and looked nice . the issue is the sole . it did not have that cushion that i am looking for . i debated keeping them anyway , but in the end returned them . 
this is my first time trying easy spirit shoes and after a couple months of wearing them i ' ve found them no better than any other shoe i ' ve tried . they are just okay . i have plantar fasciitis and these haven ' t helped any with that at all . they do hold up well and look nice , but as for how they wear i ' d just say average . i don ' t think they have much support or cushion to them at all and my feet hurt if i wear them more than a 1 / 2 hour . 
i absolutely love these shoes ! i had just bought a pair from a store and the toes in them were killing me . i put these on as soon as they were delivered and omgosh , pure heaven . no pain and comfortable ! i will be buying more of these shoes ! 
one word : super - comfortable ! i was desperate for sneakers to ease my usual 4 - 5 mile daily walks . i purchased these sneakers ( amazon vine membership played no role ) based on 2 factors : my previous positive experiences with easy spirit shoes ; and , the strength of the uniformly 5 - star reviews here and elsewhere . no break - in period required . no lie - - the day these arrived , i put them on , strapped on mygarmin forerunner 310xt waterproof running gps with usb ant stick and heart rate monitor , dropped my iphone into my waist bag , hung mylg tone - hbs - 700 wireless bluetooth stereo headset - retail packaging - black / orangearound my neck , then eased through the door . * * 7 * * miles later , i was back home . folks , that ' s a first , as i had never before cracked beyond 5 miles in one clip . probably would have kept going , if i hadn ' t exhausted my water supply . the following day , 8 miles . nuff said . ( fyi : mid - 50s ; flat arches & mild over - pronation . terrific support . ) there was one little irritant . the section of the foot , directly under the shoe - tie area , gave me a very mild throbbing sensation one day . i tend to tie my shoes very tightly . that problem was completely resolved withlock laces . ( aside : why the 310xt and iphone ? because i finally realized that iphone ( & droid ) apps grossly exaggerate calorie burn . the 310xt calculates calories expended by heart rate , yielding a more accurate picture . hey , this now - former couch potato , & admitted geek , needs / wants truly viable data , so i can track genuine progress . ) 
i have narrow feet and i never owned a pair of narrow sneakers . after trying them on i realize that they are the perfect fit . i can tell the difference in my med size sneakers . i am sooo glad that i ordered them in narrow . they are classie looking and supports my feet so well when working out and they ' re very light on my feet . therefore i never feel like i ' m loosing my balance when stretching . thank you amazon for carrying these in a narrow . 
these shoes are a great fit for my 8 ww foot . the only problem is they don ' t seem to wear long . i have been using for about 4 months and the shoe is already breaking down . i love easy spirit shoes and will probably buy again - - just with they would last a little longer . 
let ' s see , this is the third pair of these particular shoes . they fit great and wear well . while i have a narrow foot and usually wear aa or narrow shoes , i usually just buy the b withdth easy spirit and they work fine . but this time i did find them in narrow which i bought . they fit true to size . they work fine but i think the toe box is a little too narrow for me and next time i ' ll go back to the b width . excellent wearing shoe . 
i would like to know before i ordered this sneakers how to measure the feet so i could be able to know the exact size , this is the brand of sneakers that i use , and they fit well . this pair of sneakers are well cosntructed , looks nice , very comfortable , its the third pair that i buy . 
easy spirit women ' s romy sneaker , white / medium blue leather , 9 . 5 w 
i love easy spirit shoes ! i have been buying the romy sneaker for years ! just keep buying it ! they are so comfortable on my 8w size feet . i am a nurse , 12 hour shifts on my feet all day , and these are my shoes . i love them , they are also machine washable and come out of the washer looking new . please never stop making the romy ! 
my neighbor just loves these shoes and has several pairs . she is a senior and has problems with her feet but these sneakers help her very much . she was very excited when she viewed them and also thrilled at the price . very comfortable . 
i just bought this sneaker in white as i liked the same one i have in black . it fits true to size and is quite comfortable . my toes do not crunch together ; i have bunions and there ' s plenty of width room in the front . the price was right too . 
as walking shoes go . . . these are very comfortable . i don ' t usually buy shoes without trying them on . i own a couple of other pairs of easy spirit brand shoes and like them as well . they are true to size . i am pleased with my purchase . the only negative was i couldn ' t get the color i wanted as they were sold out online . 
they fit true to size , comfortable from the first wearing . no break in time needed . ! wonderful for the price . you won ' t be sorry ! 
i was looking for new walking shoes from a different brand . they discontinued my favorite shoe and while looking , the search sent me to these shoes . easy spirit romy walking shoes . they had great reviews , the price was right so i decided to try them . i will never go back to my old brand . these shoes are the lightest weight , most comfortable walking shoes i have ever worn . they fit perfect . i am beyond happy with these shoes . highly recommend . 
love , love ! they are so comfortable ! i have bad arches and theses sneakers are so good on my feet ! and my order came fast ! well worth it ! 
i love the initial comfort of these shoes when i first put my feet in them . they feel like the most cushiony pair of slippers . however , when i stand in them or walk , my ankles pronate inward . there is absolutely no support for someone who has this problem . i have very high arches and this is probably why my feet pronate . beware of this shoe if you have this problem . my feet ache bad after walking in these for a while . 
my orthotics fit great in these shoes , there is wiggle room in the toe area , and the offer very good support . incidentally , this is my second pair and i wore the soles off the old ones . 
if you wear a # 1 in easy spirit ' s this shoe is great it is 6 - 1 / 2 w which is the perfect size for me and i really like them . in the store they are the newer model without the tip up in front , but almost twice the price . 
i have two pairs - one for work and one for home . i bought the first pair for work and 3 - 4 months later i ordered my second pair for home because they are so comfortable . i didn ' t feel like i needed to ' break them in ' . i am on my feet for 12hours as a nurse and my work shoes are still comfy 6 + months later . i would buy them again . 
got these sneakers for mom as a mother ' s day gift . easy spirit makes great sneakers . an absolut must have for comfort and style . i wear easy spirit as well , these shoes are very and absolutely comfortable . i would highly recommend buying for men women or kids . 
i have wide feet ( e width ) and they ' ve been sensitive ever since i had plantar fasciitis a few years ago . i don ' t have time or energy to search a dozen shoe stores for good quality shoes in my size , so it ' s really wonderful to be able to order them online . the romy shoes i received a couple of weeks ago fit perfectly and are very comfortable - no squeezing my toes , no pressure points . my feet actually don ' t hurt after wearing them all day , even after quite a bit of walking . i ' ve already ordered another pair , and am going to try another easy spirit style . 
i ordered one full size larger with a medium width , size 11 m . they fit good but i ordered another pair only this time i ordered a 11wide width , just because i wear really thick socks . i am on my feet pretty much the whole time i ' m at work . they have proven to be very comfortable . i have been looking for a replacement for the propet ' style i had been wearing , they decided to stop making them . i just hope that these easy spirits aren ' t going to be discontinued too . 
pretty recipient loved it so do i price good stone fair would buy again moonstone is a favorite of mine very 70 ' s 
i gave them a five star rating due to the quality being great and the photo doesn ' t look as good as they do when wearing them . the moonstones are beautiful and flawless . i also love how light they are . i don ' t like earrings that are too heavy and these are the perfect weight . they were also delivered before the estimated date so that is always a good sign that this is a good company and i would order from them again and recommend them to friends and family . 
these earrings are great ! ! ! my tastes tend to run a bit on the gothic side , but i have to dress up for work every day and these a perfect . they are beautiful and well made . they are delicate , but they a long enough to make a statement . i couldn ' t be happier . 
these earrings are beautiful . the quality of the moonstones are aaa . lots of luminessense . you truly see the colors of a rainbow in all of the stones . the price is amazing for these quality made earrings . they fall right to your jaw line and frame the face nicely . they would be perfect for any size face , small , large , wide , thin , it dosen ' t matter . they can be worn for any occasion . i will order another pair so i will never be without them . 
these earrings are longer than i anticipated and the & # 34 ; rainbow & # 34 ; color just isn ' t there . i would have preferred more color to the stones . 
i love these boot , i wear them all the time , and every time i do i get loads of compliments ! ! . . . sure wish i had gotten more than one ! they are very comfortable and look really good with everything i wear ! ! a great find ! ! ! : ) 
i love these boots , the color is incredible . i normally wear a 8 . 5 to a 9 but can never find a boot that fist my giant calves in those sizes . i decided to order these in 10 and honestly they fit awesome , with socks on they are not to big and still zip over my calves . 
naturalizer , you ' ve done it ! these boots are so comfy . i could have gone down a half size but i wanted to make sure the shaft fit . a little pricey but worth it . 
fits true to size and the wide calf is about an inch bigger that what they don ' t call wide . really nice boot . i ' d buy it again . 
love the smell of quality leather ! put that with looks , quality , style and sizing and you have a winner ! really nice pair of boots . my daughter flipped over them . they will last her a good , long time . very comfortable too . 
i purchased this bra because a few others i had purchased recently didn ' t fit very well . even though they were & # 34 ; my size & # 34 ; there was something not right . so , this was taking another chance ; but since carnival is a well - known name in women ' s lingerie , i decided to try . well , it is very comfortable . fits perfectly and doesn ' t tug or bind . perhaps cups could have a little more padding but otherwise it is a very pretty bra . 
i found this bra to be very comfortable and it was true to size . i would definitely purchase this again . 
i purchased this bra to sleep in and it is excellent for that purpose . on rare occasion i will wear it around the house as well . as a 34ddd it is difficult finding bras that fit , much less that are affordable , so this was a great find . i don ' t know that i would ever wear it under my everyday clothing , but i wouldn ' t wear anything without an underwire under my clothing . 
for a nice cheap bra this works alright . but it is scratchy and not as comfortable as the nicer , more expensive ones . 
i just got my new bra 3 days early than my est delivery date . it ' s very supportive & fits really well . the band is great & holds me in place like i ' m suppose to be . i ' ve been hunting for awhile with no luck & u take a chance ordering online & i took a chance doing so . the straps are wide & comfortable & the front isn ' t too low . i don ' t spill out [ lol ] @ the top either [ i ' m not too big or real small either but with other bras i have spilled out a little ] cause it ' s well made @ the top to where it holds u in place & i ' m so glad it does . no cone shapped either [ that ' s terrible i hate that ] so when i get around to wearing a tshirt that will help . i don ' t wear tshirts very much so time will tell on that aspect . but this is a great price for this really great bra . i also took a chance on my size since i ' ve gained weight [ as we all do from time to time when u get older ] but it had to have been god having me come across this since i did take a chance & it fit perfect [ thank god ] & it is very supportive too . order this bra u ' ll be happy . it ' s true to size & comfortable & soft . nothing scratchy or itchy & don ' t poke me anywhere . everything stays in place & very comfortable & i like black . i will order more a bit later on [ taking this on a test drive but i know it will continue to pass all tests ] so by then i will be ordering more . great bra great delivery time great company 
not bad , it fits perfect and is very comfortable , it does what suppose to do , hold them up very good 
this is one very soft and comfortable bra . i am going to order another soon . the price is very reasonable too . it came pretty quickly also . 
i am 52 years old and have a bust size of 40 dd . i bought this bra for comfort - at the end of the day , etc . do not buy this bra for support but for comfort it is great ! i would buy another . 
like this bra and it is very comfortable . i hope the material does not fade after so many wash though 
not enough arch support so i added a gel insert . i wear these all day as a nurse . i expect good support and have had good luck with adidas in the past . . . but these aren ' t quite as good for support . 
i need a pari of casual dress sneakers and these are terrific . very comfortable and breathable . i got them for $ 39 . 99 and when i tried to get another pair the price jumped to $ 74 . 99 . i will buy another pair when they go on sale again . 
look nice feel comfortable but i like moresoft tennis shoes that dont mean less supportbut i think this ones are ok 
i have always bought adidas for work on my feet nine hours a day these have been the perfect show for that 
i usually wear a size 9 in womens adidas running shoes . but these outrunner shoes were very narrow and too long , so i returned them . they are very stylish and very comfortable , but not the right fit . i love adidas athletic apparel and footwear . 
i had to search several websites to make up my mind about which bag to order ; that ' s my only complaint . it would be much easier to make a decision if all the information about the different sizes and varities of bags were posted on the amazon website . i finally decided on the xs leather tote and am very happy with it . i ' m fairly petite , only 5 ' 2 " , so the xs is the perfect size for me . the bag is very good quality ; the leather is beautiful , and the craftmanship is excellent . for a small bag , it ' s very roomy inside with several different - sized pockets . it ' s also very lightweight and causes no stress or pulling on my neck and shoulder . i anticipate using this bag for many years and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality , beautiful , and easy on the neck , shoulder and back bag . 
i just got one of these , and i ' ll tell you , it is absolutely the coolest bag ever ! i prefer the " backpack " style so that i can be hands free without some bag swinging around . the regular backpacks , unless you put both arms in the arm slings , constantly fall forward . but this bag stays back on your back like it should . also , ever had problems digging down to the bottom of your bag for items under " heaps " of other junk in the way ? this resolves that issue , because , not only does the double zipper go down the length of the bag , but there are handy pockets all up and down on both sides to hold things in place . it also has two clips for holding your keys or other items . and i still have room for a book or two . this is too cool for words , i love it ! 
i have several ameribags . i have had neck problems for years and carrying a normal purse just isn ' t an option . ameribags are awesome . the leather is much heavier than the nylon version but it is so luxurious i ' m willing to deal with the extra weight . the leather is so supple ! the arctic white is a gorgeous color . i was pleasantly surprised that it isn ' t a bright white . it is more of a dusky white which i think makes it much more wearable . the extra small size will carry a lot . i can even fit my ipad mini in it with its case . i also have the small size in the sand colored leather which is gorgeous as well but just a bit bigger than i prefer . 
this bag is very well made and ( i think ) beautiful . i love these bags and own two of the distressed nylon versions . this one has a separate zipped and padded pocket that runs the length of the bag for tablet computers . although my ipad mini ' s case adds just enough bulk that it won ' t fit in the designated pocket , it fits with room to spare in the main compartment . thanks to another reviewer ' s idea , i hung a carabiner in the key ring located at the top of the bag so no more digging for keys ! all of my stuff is super organized and well protected . i have fit absolutely everything in this bag for commuting and travel and wear it cross body style to keep my hands free . and i love not having an aching back anymore from the shoulder bags that never stayed on my shoulders . 
the bag is nice and organized for holding your keys , suchas home and car too . plus , it ' s outer pouches is good forcell phone holder . 
they didn ' t fit too well for me . there ' s too much room in the toe area . ankle support was great but overall the boots felt a bit unbalanced , maybe because of the extra room and looseness up front . i heard the originals fit better . this is my first experience with the brand so i couldn ' t compare them to the original italian - made sundowners but they do seem to be pretty well made even though many ' veteran ' vasque users here will disagree . i needed a pair of boots where i can use for both outdoor ( light hiking ) and casual everyday use around town - and they must look good ! after many comparisons and reviews , it came down to either thedanner mountain light iior the sundowner . the danners are american - made but the vasque costs nearly $ 100 less at the time . unfortunately the vasque didn ' t fit too well so i returned them and bought the danner mountain ii . yes , they costs more but they can be re - crafted or re - soled down the line by danner . also , they are u . s . - made , not necessarily quality these days but at least i ' m doing my part . we ' ll see how that goes on my next take . 
my sundowner vasque hiking boots have lasted many years since the early 1990s with everyday use till the last couple of years . i used shoe polish to keep them water proof and in good shape . of course i have gone through many soles and heals ; but the leather is still in good shape after all these years . at the time when i bought my sundowner hiking boots i was not able to get the narrow size that i wear ; so i have to wear a pair of thick wool socks and two pair of cotton socks to make them fit . if i buy another pair i will get the narrow size . as far as comfort goes i always liked them and received compliments about them often . i still use them sometimes . i don ' t know where my hiking boots were made . previous to this i had italian hiking boots which are no longer sold in the usa . 
i took a chance buying these since some reviews were negative . i liked the look , so i bought them anyway . i like quality boots and have a number of them , which i alternate . the vasque boot fits great , looks good and is comfortable . 
i had a pair of these for 7 years and they were always comfortable and never leaked . hopefully the boot has not changed . 
quality pair of boots , still have my original pair i bought 15 years ago , bought a new pair for casual dress . i ' m sure i ' ll buy another pair in 15 years ! 
dr . scholl ' s shoes are very comfortable , but the pewter metallic design tends to fall off / peel very quickly . i wore these for about a month before they started to look very worn . for the price , they really are only worth it in another color . 
these are comfy and have support which is missing in most flats . my only downside for these is that they cut a bit across the ball of my foot . 
cute , true to size , and comfortable as can be ! love the memory foam insoles & i might buy another pair in different color ! 
comfortable shoes . hope to get mord dr scholls . love the footbed . . . low profile style and very up to date . not really elderly looking . good young shoe 
i own other dr . scholl shoes and i enjoy wearing them all . these are a perfect fit with a comfortable foot bed . they came well - packaged and quickly . definitely recommend . 
i needed a new pair of black flats and knew dr scholls would be comfortable . they look great . i wear between a 6 . 5 - 7 and ordered the 7 . it was a tad too big so i ordered foot petals and have no problem . the 6 . 5 would have been too fitted 
the shoe was comfortable , but a little & # 34 ; low cut & # 34 ; in the front . i don ' t like showing & # 34 ; toe cleavage & # 34 ; when wearing flats and you could see the first two toe splits . 
these shoes fit perfect and are pretty comfy . i like the detail of the buckle and the slight arch support makes them easy to wear for a long day at work . 
this shoes are very nice , i bought them in tan snake color and are really pretty . certainly because of the brand they are very comfortable though these ones maybe a bit big . i already have another pair of the same brand in size 8 . 5 and they fit very well , nevertheless these are lightly big . they are ideal to walk comfortably 
i had these in a dark red patent . they were oh - so - cute . comfortable fit , nice insole , just perfect . . . or so i thought . the extra pleather across the toe , plus the buckles are problematic . although they feel good on and standing , they are torture after walking for any length of time . the extra pleather binds the foot when walking and the buckle digs into the foot . if these were leather , not synthetic , they might give a bit . they might work for some but definitely walk in these a bit for making a decision . i wish i did . i purchased based on comfort and fit , not walkability . as a result , my shoes ended up in the charity pile . 
this shoe is prettier in person . that little hint of orange - red across the top is a nice accent next to the rich brown . i love that it comes in wide , but trust me the w is not too wide as i believe another review pointed out . i ' m probably more of a c - and it will require some break - in wear ( why only 4 stars ) but i feel sure it will be fine . i think it ' s a nice workplace shoe , but would look cute with jeans too . the heel height and shape are comfort oriented . 
this shoe is true to fit . soft leather and goes well with both dress slacks and jeans . i love these shoes ! extremely comfortable . well worth the buy . 
it ' s hard to have it stay on . it ' s a bit heavy so it didn ' t help when its a bit big 
i got it in the banana bread leather ( light brown ) color . i have medium - to - wide feet , mostly being able to get away with an 8m . after reading all the reviews , i ordered the 8w , and they fit like regular 8ms . i could imagine how tight they would be if you were a true wide . even though they fit me , i ' m still returning them , because i didn ' t realize the toes were so pointy . otherwise , it ' s a good shoe , solid for its height with good traction . 
they are very good quality shoes and very cute . however , i have wide feet and they did not seem wide enough ( i order the c / d width which works with 90 % of other shoes ) . also , even though i ordered the right size and they seemed okay length - wise while standing still , they came off of my heel with every step i took . i had to return them . i love other naturalizer shoes and own many , but these were not for me . 
gift for a friend who had a pair about 30 years old . these new ones were exactly the same style , color and design . he was very happy . they are great shoes ! 
i have an unusually high arch and this is the only shoe i can wear all day long . i have several pairs . these cover my foot so i can wear them at work in the summer . i have the full shoe also ( london ) i ' ve had for 15 years . i know i will get many years of wear out of these shoes . i would recommend this shoe to some one with plantar facitis like i have it takes the pressure off the heel . 
i scoured the internet for the beloved zurich . i love having my instep covered and appreciate the adjustable straps , because my instep is so high . this model , for me , represents the best of both worlds - a shoe that envelops your foot , yet keeps your toes free . perfect ! i ' ll never buy arizonas again . looks good with ( the right ) socks or barefoot . and of course , the arch and toe support present in every pair of birkenstocks keeps me coming back , 32 years after my first pair . highly recommended . 
i ' ve worn these sandals for over 20 years and just love the style . i have a narrow foot and the n is a good comfortable fit . and - they last ! it is important to follow the directions and care for the cork so that it doesn ' t dry out . aside from that , they are very easy care . 
i have worn birkenstocks for 20 years and they are the best shoe . i love the zurich style but the oiled leather and wool combination for these uppers is not good because it is to stiff and never breaks in . i got the iron oiled leather with grey wool . they don ' t bend at the toe or the top of the ankle causing pain on the top of the foot and strangely the calf . it did not get better over a few weeks so i sent them back . i would like to try the zurich in the suede or oiled leather though they are cute ! 
these are the most comfortable sandals in the world . however , watch the sizing if you have owned an earlier version of these since keen has changed the fit ( sales person at rei confirmed that they fit smaller than they used to ) . after getting a half size larger , all was good , but it ' s just something to be aware of . 
from the moment i put these on my feet , they fit perfectly and comfortably in the size shoe that i always wear . i love the large broad size of the hard rubber toe for added protection when hiking on rocks and in streams . the sole is very heavy durable leather tread , for long lasting and comfortable wear . i love the ankle support i feel with this particular design . they seem very durable , and work great in all weather conditions . i have challenges finding shoes that fit properly and comfortably , and took a chance by ordering without first trying them on , but i credit the great fit to the fine keen quality . 
i bought these shoes for my trip to costa rica for hiking in waterfalls . these shoes are very comfortable , great support and they manage to look cute as well , highly recommended ! as with any open type sandals you will get sand / rocks in them occasion , but this is no fault of the shoe , hope this helps ! 
i have several brands of sandals and keen tops them all ! the venice is slightly less clunky looking then the newport model . but the newport hugs the foot a bit more . the footbed of keen sandals is the selling point , no other sandal comes close . the sizing of keen , and in fact all sandals being sold now , is confusing . i have sandals bought 5 years ago in columbia brand that are one size smaller and are the same size as the keen . i noticed other brands seem to be tending that way too . i found new balance and merrel shoes seem to be trending the same way ( like a 8 is now a 9 ) you will find keen sandals selling used on ebay for almost new price because they are so loved and last forever . there are many sandals in other brands that " look " like keen . try them on and they are not even close in comfort . you will not regret buying keen sandals . comfort wise , the newport model ( which i order here on amazon too ) is a bit better fit because of more straps . i have a narrower foot then some and that may be why . the bumper toe on all of them is very clever and well needed if your going to wear the shoe . but i love them both . i know the price is hefty . . . try checking off season and amazon usually has some at a better price ( maybe closeout models ? ) 
sturdy , comfortable & they look good . they ' re great for air travel since they slip on & off easily . they ' re waterproof so walking through streams / puddles / the beach is no problem . 
i have only owned these sandals for about a week , but i love them . i wasn ' t sure what size to order given the company ' s recommendation to order a size larger because it supposedly runs small . i am normally a size 8 , and i ordered a size 8 . they fit perfectly . they are incredibly comfortable and supportive . i usually get very sweaty feet , but i did not notice much sweating while wearing these around . i haven ' t been able to wear them hiking yet , so this review is just in terms of wearing them around my work , house , and yard . 
i love the way these sandals look , fit , and feel . i was able to wear them straight out of the box with no problem . now after several uses though i really like these shoes i am not completely happy with them . they don ' t have enough support on the arch of my foot . after a simple five mile day hike i return home with aching soar feet and heals that i don ' t have with other shoes . though i really like them and will continue to wear them for this price i will not be purchasing them again . 
i love my keen sandals . they are great for camping , light hiking and general walking about . these ran a little larger than my last pair but i kept them as my feet swell a little bit in the summer months . 
i purchased 3 pairs of keen sandals , all 3 different styles . of the three , this is the only one i must return . i hesitate to evaluate shoes for anyone else unless i ' m talking about quality because i have lots of foot problems and very difficult to fit feet . i have plantar fasciitis , get cramps in my legs , feet and toes , have a narrow heel , bunions and hammertoes . the arch in the shoe , for me , seemed misplaced - - it was more forward , toward my toes and uncomfortable . also the top was a little tight for me . sometimes my foot swims in a medium width shoe , but not this one . since i didn ' t wear it , i cannot talk about the quality . i ' m enjoying the other pairs and can tell that they are more comfortable than the tennis shoes or clogs i usually wear . i ' m happy i finally found this brand ! 
these sandals are so comfortable . they fit perfect and i have worn them a lot . i am hard on sandals , walking in them in place of tennis shoes ; these seem to be able to hold up after a summer of wearing them as walking shoes . 
these are my main shoes for the summer . they are very comfortable , do not rub anywhere on my foot , dry fast , lets foot breath on hot day . can give you some funky tan lines , wash up easily . 
after alot of shopping and history with many , many river sandals , i chose the venice sandal ( not the h2 version ) , because it was affordable and i like the color . i ' m wearing them now with casual dress and will take them in the water next summer ( hope the leather straps don ' t shrink too much ) . they are as described and incredibly comfortable , with or without socks , on my awful feet . 
i decided to try these as i have not had very good luck with other similar styles in different brands . my niece had a keen size 7 similar style so i tried it on to make sure it would be okay . i usually wear a 6 . 5 but need a 7 when the shoe is closed in . these have great support and i have been wearing them around as they are also very ventilated and keep my feet cool in the hot weather . very pleased with the service from amazon . com and the price . would highly recommend this brand . 
i would recommend this shoe to everyone who likes a stylish all terrain shoe with comfort first . if they weren ' t so pricey , i would have a couple of more . 
i have bad feet ( multiple surgeries on both feet ) so i have to be careful what i put on my feet as far as comfort . my feet & # 34 ; sing & # 34 ; when i wear my keens ( i own multiple pairs ) . and the best part is that they are cute - the best of both worlds when it comes to shoes ! 
my only complaint with my new keen sandals is the rocks and such that get in and is hard to shake out - i have a high arch and narrow foot and many of the other name brand sandals were not comfortable to wear . keen venice fit from the start like they were made special for my feet . i love them ! 
i live in a hot climate and i found the footbed makes my feet sweat also got painful blisters on the back of my heel from the strap rubbing . this is my firt pair of keen and this style seems to run a half size small i needed a 9 . 5 in venice , i normally wear a 9 in other brand shoes . these make your feet look like boats , not at all attractive especially with socks which is the only way i find them comfortable . i will use them on my kayak where nobody will see my ugly giant boat shoes . not a big fan of these . 
i ordered these for my mother who is recovering from cancer surgery on her leg and needed a sandlal with a good grip . she absolutely loves the fit and how well they breathe . 
these sandals are not as comfortable as keen whisper sandals . i have wide feet and the keen venice is just not that comfortable . i wish i could return them , but i wore them outside the first day , so now it is too late . 
just purchased these to go hiking in turkey . i ' m having some trouble adjusting to the deep molded pattern in the rubber footbed , but assume there is a purpose to it and i will get used to them in time . i wear 6 . 5 extra wide athletic shoe and have had a lot of problems buying sport sandals , even other keen sandals , which give a wide appearance but don ' t actually accommodate a wide foot . the 6 . 5 medium venice is the best i ' ve tried so far . there is a slight pinch on my little toe , but it has enough room for my high arches and a very comfortable backstrap . these come in a wonderful variety of colors , which should make everyone happy , although most orders are fulfilled by amazon , the price varies greatly depending on which size / color you choose . 
own three other pairs of keens . this particular sandal runs small . had to return for a 1 / 2 size larger . like the shoe though . 
i am loving these shoes . they are so comfortable and i wear them hiking , biking , boating , walking , or just about any occasion . they were a great fit for my wide , high arched , size 11 foot . and they are lightweight too . 
i have a purple par and my mom say them and wanted them in khaki or brown . she is 80 years old and loves them , dont think she has worn anything else since she got them - - highly recommend keen ' s are awesome 
the boxers are decent . the cut is okay . i ordered the size corresponding to my waist but they are still slightly big on me . i prefer a tighter fit . still , they look okay . i do like them better than http : / / www . amazon . com / gp / product / b000phogrq / ref = cm_cr_mts_prod_img though . 
i purchased these for my husband though he ' d never heard of the " comfort soft waistband . " he was really pleased with how comfortable both the waistband and the boxers feel . they feel very soft and look great . 
delivered in only 7 days , great . unable to tell that pack contained multiple colors from picture , this would have been helpful . also shipping was $ 1 . 00 more than noted . 
these underwear look great , and fit even better . these are cotton and i was concerned about the feel and quality of these when i put them on , they feel excellent , don ' t bunch up and honestly don ' t pinch and leave a mark at the waistline . great job , will be buying more ! 
these underware are very comfortable but they do not live up to there advertizement . after washing they do not hold the tight fitting shape . this is the 2nd . set ( 4 pack ) of hanes boxer briefs that i have received over the years and still will buy more in the future , but as stated they falsely advertize that they will retain there close fitting shape ( only until the first washing ) ! 
i like this style and fit and price and have worn hanes for many years . however , they clearly have changed the specifications and the cotton is thin and somewhat scratchy . nor do they last as long . 
my experiences with this product have been for the most part unexceptional . while the cloth covering of the elastic waistband is a nice addition to the comfort level the cloth itself is somewhat disappointing . if you were looking for boxer briefs with properties of compression shorts look elsewhere , as the material stretches out quickly and has a tendency to bunch up at inopportune moments . the longevity of these shorts are also in question as the material is very thin . at the moment i think i will get 6 months of heavy wear out of these briefs . which for the price , is not an unreasonable lifetime for a low - tier bargain product . in sum , i am satisfied enough with my purchase to keep them but not satisfied enough to purchase again . 
good , comfortable boxer briefs for the price . you get four for the price that you can buy one . if you don ' t care about the designer stuff , these will work well for you . 
i bought these for my son for christmas . he loves the soft waistband and these are the boxer / briefs that he always asks for . 
simply put , these are the most comfortable underwear i ' ve ever owned . i ' ve had underwear that cost 6 times as much , including designer boxers , but the comfortsoft waistband makes these more comfortable . yes , they do tend to stretch out and turn more into boxers after time , but it does not bother me . if anything , they get even more comfortable . plus , they cost about $ 2 . 50 a pair . if the get too loose , i ' ll just toss them out and buy new ones . 
very comfy ! . . . . . hanes comfortsoft boxer brief p4 , assorted solids , large . . . . my husband is happy with them they wash well and i like that amazon has such a great selection and good prices ! ~ 
what else can i say about them ? they do the job intended , comfortable . see how they hold up , time will tell . 
these are my husband ' s favorite ! thank you for the quick delivery and great price ! i love not having to deal with going to the store with a baby and yet still getting competitive pricing . 
love these boxers . they are very comfortable and relaxing to wear . i hope they continue to make these , i think i will stick to them . 
the underwear are very comfortable and well made . they don ' t ride up or anything like that . i like these and would recommend them . 
these are the boxer briefs my husband will wear . so it ' s perfect , for him at least . recommended , no to tight . 
do not buy these , i wish i had not thrown the money away on these . originally when i bought these for my husband he really enjoyed them . i even went so far as to order a second package of 4 , especially when i saw the price decrease . so sorry i did . original purchases early 2012 - it is now august . he absolutely cannot ( not to be confused with will not ) wear these any more . the first 2 months were fine - he really liked them a lot ; very comfortable and glad he changed from the regular briefs he had been wearing for years , usually hanes brand . i followed washing instructions to the letter . he said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up . first : around the waistband was no longer holding up - no weight change , actually i purchased because he had lost weight but now has maintained . second : the worst part - he says the elastic around the legs is completely non - existant . in other words does not hold him at all . we have thrown them all out . this is the first time he has insisted i go on amazon & warn other people like we ' ve relied on reviewers before us . thanks to the reviewer who gave me a place to start to purchase different brands ( 2xist , c - in2 , calvin klein , puma ) to see what he likes . so disappointed in the hanes brand overall will not consider any more of their products for men or women ever . 
these boxer briefs fit great , feel great , seem to be sized properly . i will buy again . maybe better color variety , but that ' s my only suggestion . 
i ' m old but i got over the tighty whitey phase long ago . i don ' t want boxers which can look a bit funny under my dress pants and these are nice . they are very comfortable and seem to last . i bought these like a year ago , just doing the review . 
my husband just started wearing boxer briefs instead of regular boxes and he loves them . i ' ve bought two hanes packs ( one here and one from elsewhere ) and he loves both . 
the waistband and cotton are a bit thin for my taste . the best boxer briefs i ' ve ever found are the duluth trading company men ' s free range cotton boxer briefs . they are in my opinion the standard for which all boxer briefs should be judged . they however cost 4x what these hanes 4 - pack do . these hanes comfort soft are a good backup for me when my duluths aren ' t washed . better than most but not quite the best . 
i have in my drawer a pair of hanes comfort soft underwear i bought from a local big box store about 3 years ago . they are soft , comfortable , and breathe fairly well . unfortunately , these new hanes " comfort soft " [ not ! ! } underwear may resemble the old ones in a picture , and both are called comfort soft , but in real life they are simply horrid . the material is so rough i feel i could use them to hand scrub heavily stained pots and pans . the problem is they are using such a rough fabric , that it is extremely irritating to my skin . in addition , this product does not breath at all . i found myself waking up with so much sweat in all the wrong places , that i had to slip off my underwear in the middle of the night and fling them across the room . in addition , because they use such crappy material for the body , the wrap around on the waistband is just about as rough as any waist band i have ever felt . there was no point in even wrapping these waist bands . i will never buy a hanes product again ! after having tried several brands that are being sold today , i have finally found underwear that is good . if you want soft , comfortable underwear that breathes properly , you want stacy adams underwear . it is my # 1 choice . eddie bauer isn ' t too bad either , but if i could give stacy adams underwear a 10 star rating , i would give eddie bauer underwear probably a 7 or 8 star rating , depending on the particular item selected . and , of course , hanes underwear deserves a zero star rating , in my opinion . ( fruit of the loom = 1 star , just in case somebody is wondering . . . merona used to sell underwear my size , but stopped . the merona underwear i have left would get about a 4 or 5 star rating . i ' ve checked out merona underwear at target , and it still feels like the stuff i bought when it was available . 
i ' ve come to know what to expect from the hanes brand but i havn ' t figured out the sizing quite yet . the briefs are medium and they are quite loose and i have purchased large sizes in other briefs and they fit much tighter . i guess the brand just runs big in it ' s sizes . apart from that i ' m content . 
very good fit . . . . my pant size is 48 ~ or so and these fit good . no balling up or anything like that . . . will buy more when i need too : ) 
comfy 
my hubby likes these undies best . he says they ' re comfy & fit perfectly . they do shrink a tiny bit , but i always buy a size bigger for that reason . son & hubby are both very happy with these . i recommend them . 
husband will only wear these as they have the comfort waistband . . . this was another case where we made the walmart trip and they did not have the xxl so off to amazon we went . . . got what we needed from amazon and with prime i had in ( 2 ) days . 
these are the most comfortable boxer brief underwear that i have ever wore . not having a waist band makes up a big deference . 
arrived on time . product as expected . 
nice set of underwear . i like the feel and the fit . colors are very soft / pastel like . will recommend and buy againthanks raul 
the band is narrow and poorly finished so it rubs against the skin uncomfortably - these had to be hanes rejects - couldn ' t return them so i toss them out - total loss stay away from these crappy , uncomfortable underwear 
the actual product is rather comfortable . like other reviewers i have found that there is some stretch in the legs after wearing them for more than a few hours . i find that the product does return to fitting properly again after rewash . * * note that assorted color is more than assorted greys . i received 1 tan , 1 dark blue , 1 medium blue , and one red . 
these were as expected , been ordering them for years and it was time to restock . more words are needed , ugh 
i have had two serious abdominal surgeries that have left my digestive tract in confusion . if i eat the wrong food or my system gets upset i can encounter fecal incontinence . if that happens , it is not too bad , but i sleep with bottoms that are made with a saddle so i can use a pad to insure my security at night . these shorts by hanes fill the bill . i do not like a fly at night as it tends to ease the fit i am looking for . i do wish hanes made a 2xl as i have a waist of 42 and a bit of a tummy so they are a little snug . but that is not a problem , they fill my need quite well and i ' m happy with them . 
i have cerebral palsy and rett syndrome . i plan to hopefully get into a medical career but if it doesn ' t happen i still have some awesome scrubs , clothing , whatever it is called in my situation . with spasticity you can ' t have clothing that limits your movement , check , the dickies scrubs allow full range in the arms and neck with no restrictive feeling . with spasticity and sensory sensitivity you need comfort , the fabric is simple and comfortable , nothing fancy . when you deal with a condition like this , things can get messy , drool , spills , etc . these wash really easily and even if i get a spot of drool in the middle of the night its quickly cleared off with some alcohol wipes . perfect there . cleanability is 5 of 5when you deal with these conditions you want clothing to last , you dont have money to spend on new stuff often . this stuff has been worn day in and day out by me for the last 3 - 4 months and washed every week , no fading no nothing , no pulled threads nothing . perfectwhether your in the medical profession or not , the dickies scrubs are a great way to go for work wear . oh and another great plus , its split at the sides at the bottom ( i aint no clothing genius , i think this is called a hem ? ) but this is a huge benefit for wheelchair users ! ! ! 
my husband really likes the dickies brand for scrubs . they fit well and are not too thin of a material . 
for a male these are sized properly . the color is strong , and the quality is excellent . there are two tags in the neck line and you ' ll want to cut out the paper one . the price is excellent , shipping was quick . a couple of washes right out of the package did soften these somewhat . 
can ' t complain about this top . has held up well through numerous washes . medium actually fits as expected , unlike the matching pants . . . 
the fabric is very cool for those who work all day , easy to wash by machine , and the material is quite good , for whom size m the shirt is a little big , so i recommend if you is size m buy size s . 
it does run big but its a guy shirt and im a girl . even the xstra smalll is a little big . love the pocket in the top , . it works well for what u need it for . its not to fit beautifully . 
arrived on schedule . well packaged . the fabric is very stiff . i thought i could soften them up by washing several times with softener but not the case . the fabric is so stiff , that after washing i tossed it on my ironing board and it was partially standing . the peak was higher than my iron . the texture and feel of the fabric is scratchy and somewhat harsh . the sizes are way off . a medium engulfs me . they do not shrink after hot water washings . the tops have a slit up the side and appear very feminine . i have never worn dickies before and i really regret ordering these . since i washed them i cannot return them , so i am going to give them away . as a guy , there is nothing i like about this product . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i gave these away . the lady that took them agreed the fabric was " stiff and scratchy " . however , her biggest complaint was that after removing from the dryer , the amount of lint on the scrubs . she had to use 2 - 3 sticky roller sheets per side of the tops and bottoms to remove the lint . the scrubs are dark blue . i ordered landau . their products are much better suited for my needs . i can wash and dry without doing anything else . they do not look feminine and the fabric does not feel like a toe sack . 
i love these scrubs . i don ' t ever wear anything else . they are comfortable and hold up really well . i highly recommend them . 
not very form fitting , but it is a nice top . i got the white , so you can see through it a bit . it feels a little stiff . it ' s not my favorite , but it works . 
buying things like this is sometimes difficult online since i have larger breasts than average . i ordered xxxl since i wasn ' t sure if it was going to fit up there or not . maybe i should have ordered xxl . it was definitely roomy , but i expect things like this to shrink . the sizing chart is not right so don ' t go by that . i have a 50 inch chest and xxl would have fit me perfect . this will do though . the quality and fabric is very nice and in a great color . just order down one size . 
i bought my usual 2x and it was a bit snugger than i ' m used to . the material is sturdy , though . 
we have to wear solid color uniforms for work now . the tops fit as expected . we do use bleach and it changes the color a bit , but i will have to deal with it . 
true to size , but , very boxy and stiff . not a comfortable wear , equivalent to buying from local walmart or thrift store 
fabric is pretty nice and seems like it would last through many washes . however , the cut and fit does not look right . it is more of a boyish cut . i ordered an x - small , which fits around the waste and bust right . but the shoulders are bit wide . comparing this to another dickies top i bought ( different style ) , the cut of the shoulders are extended past the natural line , which gives you a linebacker look . it ' s priced right and the color is a lovely purple , but i can ' t overlook the fact that i look like a football player when i wear this . 
the sleeves do not let you raise arms so you can work with comfort . . . other brands are roomier . . . i will not order these again 
my wife has been at the same job at the hospital for 30 plus years , and she likes to have different scrubs , and she likes this . 
i purchased the galaxy blue in a size medium . i found this to be slightly more roomy than the usual size medium scrub top that i wear , but i actually preferred the loser fit . it is a very comfortable top , and great quality . 
i am just so disappointed in how short the tops are . yes , i am tall and a plus size . however , i read and read and re - read reviews on uniforms . i was use to ordering from one stop shop which is a company that sells for places like catherine ' s , roman ' s and lane bryant , the 4x you purchase from somewhere like romans or catherine ' s is no where close to a 4x in these scrubs . these scrubs run so much smaller than the plus size clothing line of clothes . ladies , just be aware and know that you may read how these run large and fit as expected but most of these comments are not coming from someone needing a plus size uniform . 
really nice color kinda varies from the bottoms but i like that ' s it longer them other scrub tops that ' s cool 
nice scrubs . not the softest like other dickies scrubs , but will work . the candy orchid is such a pretty color . subtle , not outlandish . 
these scrubs are great quality , color is true wine not purpleish sold in department stores comfortable and true to size . will buy again 
it fits well . it is comfortable , and has nice pockets - a must ! i bought in crisp white , and am happy with the color . 
this is the second time i have bought from dickies and this item is every bit as good as the last top i purchased . my friend is a wood crafter and gets sawdust all over her self . these tops are excellent to protect her and i would recommend them for this and also for their very reasonable cost . 
itchy , stiff fabric . i normally buy another brand but i tried dickies because they have a good name . i personally do not care for them , and will return to buying my normal brand . 
it nice very cool and don ' t wrinkle much in a all day wear is worth the money but runs a little big which i don ' t mine loose fitting top . so go down a size if u like snog fit . 
i wore it to work on the first day received compliments on how nice it looks i have large busts and smaller hips so it fit my top leaving enough room to move comfortable on top and went to my hips not making me look like i am pregnant . 
its ok 
speedy delivery but the sizes run large . i usually order a large in dickies scrub tops and they fit very well but this scrub top was way toooooo big . sizing needs to be changed 
good quality material . like the comfort fit of the top . usually wear a size medium but ordered a large and glad i did , its not too tight . 
i like it very much it ' s fit very very good . it is just what i was looking for . the fabric is very good . don ' t change color with the washes . 
only scrubs that i wear ! i love how you can wash and wear them , with little to no wrinkling . i love the empire waste scrub tops best , as this one was a bit bulky on me . i returned for the empire waisted style by dickies . i still love all of the dickies products . i ordered a large and it fit me a bit big , but that is the way i like it . im also about 155 pounds , so this was a perfect size for me . 
love the material - does not need ironing , and that makes me very happy . material & # 34 ; breathes & # 34 ; - doesn ' t make you feel hot like some brands do . 
i ' m wear in ' this top right now , with the bottoms to match . love the color , it ' s true to size , washes up great , and doesn ' t shrink ! 
needed a set of scrubs for my clinical studies but didnt want to pay an arm and a leg . love the way these fit . 
for the price , i would expect the pants to come with it . unfortunately , this was a top - only . fit was as expected . it ' s ok , but overpriced for just a top . 
it fits great and i ' m sure it will not wear out , but it ' s going to take many , many washings to make it soft enough to be comfy . 
these are a really durable and comfortable scrub . . . they wear like iron . will be back for more eventually . not sorry that i bought these . 
this fit surprised me because i thought i was purchasing a unisex top ; if i would have read the description clearly i would have definitely ordered a large . i am somewhat busty & of course prefer to downplay my assets at work ; any t - shirt or button - down top i absolutely have to order a & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; . this top is much bigger than i expected , so much so that i feel a little & # 34 ; fluffy & # 34 ; when wearing it , which isn ' t the worst thing but a surprise nonetheless . other than that my only other complaint is that the fabric collects lint like crazy . 
this is cut narrower than xlarge sizes in other brands - bust , shoulders fit but slim in the waist and hips . 
these scrubs are durable and comfy ! nice thick material but still roomy . a little big but i think most scrubs run a little bigger . 
dickies scrubs are comfortable to wear on daily basis . they fit really nice and have a good design to them . 
i love the color of this item ! it fits well and its the only brand of scrubs i would buy . great fabric ! 
i love the caribbean blue color . it has a decent fit for the price . i received many compliments on the color . 
the color is really pretty and the quality is great . i am really happy with these scrubs for the price . 
fits very loose for someone who wears size 8 - 10 . will be comfortable for work and layering with long sleeve t - shirt . 
shipping was quick and on time , fits good true to size . i like the pockets they ' re nice and big to keep your phone or whatever else you would need to have with you through out the day . would recommend and buy from the company again . 
i ordered an xs . i ' m 5 ' 5 , 118lbs , 34 & # 34 ; bust and this fits pretty perfect . it isn ' t supposed to be fitted in the waist , so it is still loose just as a classic scrub should be , but the xs fits my shoulders perfectly . the pockets are deep which is handy . as for the material , it is typical dickies fabric . it is quite stiff , and not soft like grey ' s anatomy , but in all honesty , that is what makes it so durable and long lasting ( it gets softer with washes over time ) . although i am not a fan of dickies scrub pants ( due to the shape ) , and traditionally they do size on the larger side - i still love this classic top , and it generally matches with all my other scrub pants . 
just had surgery and they are the most comfortable pants i can wear . quick dry and no fade . i like it that they are light weight . 
cute as always , good quality , size . . . well , i bought a small and it was tight , when i buy wink and is a little loose ; then i bought a medium and it was gigantic ! so , last time i get these pants , never more . 
great value for the money heavier than most scrub pants . the size is a little smaller than the other brands i have purchased . 
good scrub pants . chocolate almost looks black in some lighting . size small fits my size 6 frame . not very soft but can live with that . 
these scrubs were true to size , great quality and reasonable priced . love the fit . definately would purchase again . color is true wine not the purpleish sold in department stores 
like most scrubs this material is a bit rough but durable wash after wash . hard color and fit to find . 
they were too tight at the waist and the legs are too big . when i tried them on i looked terrible ! even though it says elastic waist they don ' t give at all and the waist band is wide so it actually hurts to wear them . 
they are good pants they are a little big but i good purchase for the money . they have plenty of pocket if that is some thing your looking for in a pair of pants 
these pants are true to size and can really take and beating ! i plan to pick up a few more of them ! 
if you ' ve got animals , be prepared to use a lint brush always . the high polyester content , i ' m assuming , acts like a magnet for any type of lint , hair or even carpet fibers . as for the fit , i am 165 lbs and 5 ' 7 1 / 2 & # 34 ; , but have long legs . based on one of the comments from someone who is similar in height and weight to me , i ordered the average large , thinking , as she stated , would be long enough . the size was great , even a little roomy , but definitely not falling off of me , but the length was too short . they are lightweight and comfortable . had it not been for the fabric ( lint attracting ) , i would have gotten these in the large and just had them hemmed , since the price was terrific . 
i was very please at the quality and design ease of these pants for work at the hospital . the pants wash beautifully , need no ironing if taken out of the dryer slightly damp and hung on a pants hanger . by morning they are smooth and ready to go once more . thanks ! 
perfect quality work pants ! great price and great fit ! i would highly recommend these pants for nurses ad culinary workers ! 
like the quality of material . fit is a little loose , but that ' s the way i like it , ordered assize med . 
i ' m wearing these right now with the top to match . they are very comfortable , true to size , wash up great , and do not shrink ! 
the size on these pants was not the normal 4x . i would guess them to be more like 6x . they are way too long and on the pocket that is on the right leg just above the knee is a bright red dickies tag . i really don ' t want to wear pants with a tag on the middle of my leg . they wrinkled when they were washed . ( hot water did not shrink them . ) maybe if they actually fit , i might be happier . 
these fit perfectly and they look nice . i don ' t use them as scrubs but as everyday pants even to appointments . i call these my u { ss pants because it sure comes close to the brown they war . i would love it if navy or black is available . 
i love the color the style is comfortable soft dries fast i feel good in it easy to iron and wear 
i purchased these scrub pants with the matching jacket and love them both . the fabric washes well and only needs a light ironing . i have probably washed the pants 10 times and they have not faded . the length and fit are perfect , too . i will purchase another pair of these pants in a different color . 
some scrub pants seem to be so short they pull up above your socks when you sit down , but these fit very nicely . really good quality , and a little large in the waist . i am very happy with these . 
i don ' t like the front closing where you have to tie it to keep it where you want it . it becomes especially horrible when you have to run to the bathroom and untie it . i ended up cutting the time in order to respond to natures demands . i cut a small slt in each side at the waist band and use the holes in the frond to thread a piece of elastic through the waste and that takes care of the problem . wish i had thought of the problem be for it arose . i do like the scrubs though and once the waist band was fixed i will be wearing them often . 
i am a wheelchair user who is going to school for anesthesiology so getting ahead of the game and grabbing up scrubs early . but these pants run huge , a small is more like a mens medium , there is no way the waist size on the small is a 32 and the inseam is way too long ! they are very stiff and have no stretch , which is a bit of a problem when your a wheelchair user , you want a little bit of stretch . heck even an able bodied person will want a little bit of stretch to accommodate movement . these are as baggy as rapper pants on me too . i ' ll go look into other brands for pants . as far as tops dickies has me sold but the pants either i need to buy from a different collection ( not eds ) or go to another manufacturer . update : wednesday aug 15th i received my new pair x - small they fit my legs lovely and they do have a little tiny bit of srtretch , again dickies has me sold . just ordered 3 more tops and 3 more pants ! 
while i am a plus size female , it ' s really hard finding plus size scrubs for women and in a & # 34 ; tall & # 34 ; . i decided to try the mens pants and i was pleasantly surprise to find they do run longer than the womens . so , for you tall and plus size ladies our there who are tired of wearing high water scrub pants , try the plus size in a & # 34 ; mens & # 34 ; and i think you will be pleased as i was . good luck ! 
dickies unisex scrubs ~ very rarely do i review pants , simply because i frankly can ' t ever decide whether to call them trewes , trousers , breeches ( britches to me and mine ) or pantaloons . it ' d be easier if there was only one acceptable name , such as is the case with dungarees . ah well . english is so redundant isn ' t it ? due to this specific item , i will offer a warning : whether you ' re an olympian , a healthcare worker ( get back to work ) or a cripple like myself , i really do suggest avoiding drawstring scrubs . it ' s nice they are honest so you must know : elastic - waist , which is ideal , is labeled as such . drawstring are just floppy rectangular pants and that drawstring will bring you heartache after heartache . the pants are about what you ' d expect . the fit is generous ( or damned dangerous if you get them even one size too large , as i did ) . the fabric is tough as nails and i can ' t imagine any proper loungewear wardrobe without a few pairs of these ~ they are strong enough to fly out the door ( with you in them ) to work in the garden or to visit the store . naturally , if you are in health care , get off the web and get back to work ! ! as a final word of advice : better you stick to cherokee brand scrubs with an elastic waistband . . . and if you can , avoid cargo pockets because they can interfere with movement . i advise this because my needs are special ~ due to my size and other necessities , i get cherokees in a 5x and they are a delight . naturally , if you are big - and - or - tall , i ' d skip amazon and go to king size direct . tell ' em i told ya . 
i am not a big girl but these unisex smalls ran very small ! i was disappointed that they were so snug i had to give them away as i had washed them and ironed them then realized they were teeny weeny . 
nice colored pants that hold up well through the wash . they pair well with the dual color wine and black top . very nice ! 
bought these for work as i need to wear khakis ! these where the worst ! fell off my butt all day ! waste of money ! im buying scrubs from wal - mart ! 
these scrubs are literally island blue . . . like teal blue . i can ' t really see my boyfriend wearing them now that i have them in my hand . i ' ll return them for dark blue . i would totally wear them if they were not so big , but i am a woman and teal is so my color ! 
i got these in the mail . they were a size too big , so i called the company and was instructed to send them back for a replacement . i was promptly sent a size smaller . the seller actually credited my card the $ 2 difference in price as well ! these scrubs are durable and look great . they only have one back pocket though . 
i ordered a 5x just incase they shrank when washed . what i got were a 5x top and a 4x bottom . the bottoms were too long and the top just fit snuggly . good thing i ordered a size or two up . in other brands i get a 3x . you can tell these are their lower end products . they are okay in a pinch but i would not order again 
they are made of substantial enough cloth that you know they will last . they fit well , and stay where they are supposed to . lastly , they are a great price . it ' s a win / win / win ! 
i ordered these for lounging pants . i normally take a & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; , and ordered that size . however , when they arrived they were tight in the thigh . my thighs are muscular , but not anything like a weightlifter . not only were they tight in the thigh , but also loose around the stomach . if you have big thighs ( or if you ever plan to squat down in these ) go up a size . 
i have purchased 2 of these through amazon . at an average cost of $ 90 . 00 i would have expected quality . the plastic is light and creeks when you open that glasses . you get the distinct feeling that it is not very flexibleand will snap . it is said to be made in italy ! ! ! i really doubt it . if it is authentic , i really feel for rayban falling so far below standard . my advise to you , is to pay more , go to a shop and feel the quality before you buy . you are not getting a bargain from thisamazon seller . 
can ' t beat these ! ! match any outfit and look stunning ! these are my second pair after i lost the first pair . that ' s how much i love them ! 
they were huge on my face so i had to send them back , wish i could have tried them on before i purchased them 
ray - ban has really done well on the new wayfarer design . fit my face nicely . not too tight , not too loose . . . just right . glad i spent a little more on these to get the polarized version . outstanding quality . 
i was a little concerned that the sunglasses were not the real deal due to such a cheap price . but several forums confirmed that these can be had at this price . truthfully , i have no way of really knowing if these are the real deals or not but they seem like great glasses to me - very happy with them ! as for a review of the product - i thought the 52mm would be too small for my face and ordered the originals in the 54mm as well - turns out the 54mm had too much of a drop for my face while the 52mm looked the best . my face / head is more along the lines of what they call & # 34 ; heart shaped & # 34 ; thus narrow glasses that have more - or - less straight lines to them tend to look the best on me . the tortoise pattern on these are nicley sub - dued and not too overpowering as some other brands ( persols ) . 
i bought these as a christmas gift for myself . i wear glasses for near sightedness so i was looking for something that looked good but also could have prescription lenses added . i wear them all the time now ! 
the glasses bought from seller " vision123 " $ 50 cheaper than buying from ray - ban . com or local store . very good deal , only if it was new like it says in the description . glasses are 100 % authentic , very nice looking pair of sunglasses . overall : just wasn ' t happy how the product was listed as new , but the box wasn ' t in new condition . and the stick i can see have been ripped off and replace with a different one . i think it could have been a customer return or something . 
these ray - bans were a great purchase . though i usually buy cheap sunglasses , i decided to pop for these ray - bans , and i am glad i did . they are made very well and are quite comfortable to wear . they do a great job blocking out the sun too ! they also came with a hard - sided case that protects them very well when they are not being worn . 
they ' re a perfect , modern wayfarer and exactly what i was looking for . i had to order the 55 mm size because the smaller size was too small for my face . no complaints , great ray ban quality . 
good scope of protection considering its desing which expose lateral view . light weighted to use them for hours . i drop them by accident into rocks about 6 foot high and did not suffer even 1 scratch which is pretty cool . so you can expect quality of product . i am looking foward to buy a sporty look ones now . 
i bought these ignoring the poor reviews since they were sold by amazon but the negative reviews were true . i don ' t know if they ' re fake , everything checked out , but they felt cheap , the arms creaked , and the lenses felt loose . i even went to sunglass hut to double check and they are definitely lower quality . they ' ve been returned . 
the glasses are well made and durable . the optic clarity is better than the cheap glasses . i find the tint to be just right for my eyes . 
the price was reasonable . this is a very popular style which looks good on most faces . terrific lenses and solid , durable frames . 
i love these glasses . i have never spent more than $ 30 on sunglasses and i now regret all those flimsy , throwaway purchases ! these are wonderfully balanced . the glass gives them nice heft while the sturdy frames provide solid support comfortably . the honey shade is both attractive and soothing on sunny days . awesome colors for a redhead . : ) 
great sun glasses but the frames were not right in color for my face . . but otherwise nice sale and great seller to . 
although i normally wear corrective lenses , i have discovered that one of the few benefits of aging has been an improvement in my distant vision . my distant vision has improved so much in the past couple of years until my prescription sunglasses are too strong ( while my close vision has gotten increasingly worse ) . so i decided to buy some cheap drug store sunglasses to replace the prescription sunglasses . it only took one wearing to find the wavy plastic lenses caused eyestrain . so i started shopping for some good quality sunglasses that would not cost a fortune . the ray - ban brand was a major player in sunglasses when i was growing up . my dad had the outdoorsman models with the adjustable earpieces and a considerable number of family and friends wore aviators and wayfarers . back in those days , ray - bans were a staple in every drug store , just like the cheap $ 5 . 00 sunglasses are today . looking at today ' s ray - bans seemed a logical approach . which leads me to the new wayfarer i eventually purchased . past experience with the metal frame in one pair of ralph lauren prescription glasses showed me that i can develop a nasty skin rash if i ' m allergic to the metal formula content - - apparently nickel is the culprit . other than the flexon by marchon metal frames , i generally favor plastic . i like the look of the classic ray - ban sunglasses and the wayfarer design looked like the top choice for me . after reading a good bit about fit and sizing for the ray - ban wayfarers and new wayfarer designs online , i decided to go with the new wayfarer , tortoise frame , g - 15 xlt lens in the 55mm size . for my face , it was perfect fit . these are very comfortable glasses . the clarity of the lenses is astonishing when compared to cheap knock - off sunglasses i initially tried wearing . these sunglasses cut the brightness a lot - - minus 85 % of the visible light , according to ray - ban . the glasses appear to me to be well - made . ray - ban makes a bewildering array of options in frame and lens materials , colors , sizes and models . it ' s very confusing and i ' m still not clear on the difference in some of the materials . i think the difference between the original wayfarer and the new wayfarer is very subtle and has to do with the angle and depth of the lenses . whatever , i ' m happy with the glasses i bought . 
i love the shades ! they are comfortable and look great . the seller delivered in less than 24 hours and the price was the best . have never been happier with a pair of sunglasses since my first pair in 1987 ! but these are better because they are polarized . 
i ordered these sunglasses and while i liked them and do not doubt their authenticity despite some of the claims that people received fakes , they were just too small for me . i prefer larger sunglasses so i ended up returning them . but they are very nice and a decent price for polarized ray - bans . 
i have known about ray - ban for a while now but never had an interest to buy it until recently . these shades are soooooo hot ! i love them and i look forward to the compliments i know i ' m gonna receive . the are sturdy and really outstanding . comes with case and cleaning cloth - really really really great buy . 
ordered the matte black polarized sunglasses and they are really nice for the price . also made in italy : ) ( at least for this pair , seems others have had different experiences ) 
these sunglasses were a perfect purchase for me . i love the smaller version of the original wayfarer . the tortoise color / pattern is great and it comes with the ray - ban case and cleaning cloth . i ' m hoping they come out with a few more different colors in this style because i will be buying more . 
as others have noted , if you are average to above - average size ( mainly facially ) i would recommend getting the 55mm as opposed to the 52mm . these fit great ; i am 6 ' 1 with somewhat large facial features and the wayfarer ' s sit nicely on my nose and are proportionate . i am always hesitant to buy glasses i haven ' t tried on , but went out on a limb here since they were on lightning deal . i love the color of the frame ( mine are darker that the image shown , and almost look black in some lighting , which looks great imo ) and the glass - tint provides great protection with a clear / crisp image . came with a nice brow - leather semi - hard case and cleaning cloth . glasses fit perfectly in the case and don ' t take up a lot of room , which is great for my ever - cluttered center console in my suv . i have always wanted a par of these & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; raybans and now i have them ! with the lightning deal @ around $ 70 you can ' t beat the value . this is my 3rd pair of raybans and i am a very satisfied customer again 
i ' ve been a fan of the wayfarer for a long time . but the original side profile had too deep a lean for my face . enter : the new wayfarerit ' s the exact same facing profile but the lean is dramatically reduced . no more rims digging into my cheeks . what i like best about these is that they come in 55mm lens widths . for wide faces like mine , that ' s important . they fit in all dimensions this way . while these standard sunglasses lenses are better than the average , i would highly recommend paying the extra $ 10 and getting the polarized lens version . i did . so why do i have these , too ? i like the profile so much , i bought these just to take out the lenses and get my optometrist to put in my prescription lenses . but here ' s why i had to do it this convoluted way . ray - ban just started offering this model in their prescription lens line . but they only have it in the 52mm size . and they cost twice as much . these also have the ray - ban logo embossed on the arms . not all the prescription frames do , even if there is plenty of room to . yes , i lose out on getting a prescription frame hard case but that ' s a small trade - off for having a set of frames that are attractive , official , and fit right . 
i love it ! i love the color , the material and the lenses ! i have ray ban ' s in many colors , but this is my favorite and matches jeans perfectly ! 
bought these for my 15 - year - old son for valentine ' s day . he had been wanting some & # 34 ; cool & # 34 ; shades . read the reviews on the original wayfarer . saw some unhappy reviews . decided to go with the & # 34 ; new wayfarer . & # 34 ; good decision . they fit him perfectly . got the 55mm lens . would definitely buy again if he ends up losing these or stepping on them which is a high possibility with a teen . 
i love this style and have several pairs . these were especially loose on my face for some reason , but i ' ll just be visiting my optometrist for him to heat and tighten them for me . 
ok , first an admission : i am traditionally a zz top styled " cheap sunglasses " kind of guy . not that i cant afford expensive styles , i just normally don ' t fork it over for them . i bought these because i just liked the way they look . not for this week ' s trendy style , not for comfort , not for the name . i had been searching for a pair of black frame shades in the 1960s enduring style of cool ( think dirty harry ) and came across these . my hat size is 7 5 / 8 and i did not know what 55mm meant size wise . surprise ! ! they fit like a glove ! ! excellent quality , excellent " cool " factor in just the thing i had in mind . durable ? we will see . practical ? probably not . over the top ? not by a long shot , there are hundreds costing much , much , much more . will i be careful with them ? youbetcha . nice item and rapid transit from the seller via usps parcel mail . 
i bought these for my husband and he loves them ! ! he also looks great in them ! a cool style and he ' s gotten many compliments ! they shipped fast and are a great price ! 
these sun glasses look and feel great . these are the " new wayfarer " style from ray ban so they are slightly smaller than the previous iterations . the crystal green lens is great for bright weather and driving on sunny days . might be a bit too dark in partly cloudy or overcast weather if you are not accustomed to them . the glasses themselves are typical ray ban quality , which is quite good and they are not too heavy and don ' t really cause me too much fatigue wearing them for long periods of time . they fit quite comfortably actually . i would definitely recommend them for a good daily use pair of sunglasses . 
love these ray ban ' s ! they are what i expected and couldn ' t be happier . they are comfortable to ware and do their job . 
this was my first pair of " expensive " sunglasses . totally worth it , make sure you take care of them . these were recommended to me by a lady friend and they look great . make sure they compliment the shape of your face before buying , not everyone can pull off every style of sunglasses . i went car shopping and the salesmen looked at them and said " you look like you have good credit . " ha ! there is something to be said about the ray - ban name . once you buy these you ' ll notice how bad some of the knockoff wayfarers look . unfortunately i lost my pair in the pacific ocean : - ( and i ' m probably going to buy another pair ! there are lots of other colors and styles of ray - ban wayfarer so don ' t limit yourself to black ! . 
what a great price for these ! i bought them for my boyfriend for christmas . he has a wider face and they fit perfectly . i ' d recommend these for those with bigger faces as they are the bigger frames . i can ' t stress enough how important ( and easy ) it is to go to a ray ban dealer and try these on before buying them - - you are really saving yourself time . they came with a beautiful brown case as well . i am used to the black cases so this was a surprise to me ! my boyfriend couldn ' t be happier with them . he has had a more modern pair of ray - bans for a few years but now he only wears these ! ray - ban is seriously the best brand of sunglasses you can get ! 
purchased the rb2132 polarized wayfarer and have found them to be a great pair of sunglasses . they are authentic and exactly what i ordered and i will certainly purchase from paris miki optical in the future . 
great sunglasses ! much cheaper than the mall , but the exact same thing . these were definitely authentic unlike what some reviewers were saying . mine were a color sold by amazon directly so maybe that has something to do with it . be sure to check who is actually selling these when buying , but i could not be happier . great fit . also 55mm is definitely what you want if you are an adult - - others would for sure be too small 
i got the 52 - mm frame , which fit my smaller face perfectly . they arrived quickly , and are of the excellent ray - ban quality i always expect . i highly recommend these , particularly at such a great price . 
i really love these sunglasses . it is the first time i have spent this much on sunglasses and i am very happy i did . 
very very nice . small frame ( not kids size , small adult size ) , but that is what i wanted . very happy with these sunglasses . 
got these for my 13 yo son and he loves them . he is very selective and i took a chance by getting these - the price is wonderful and the quality is great . has worn them daily since christmas . 
this item was purchased as a gift . recipient is very happy with the product . love the tom cruise " look " . i am happy with timely delivery . thanks again . debbie 
great glasses for a real ray - ban fan . these is great and a must - have . i ' m a huge fan and let me tell you : these lenses are simply amazing and will really be a good addition to your looks . very high quality and the polarized lenses are very good . highly recommended . 
received these glasses in australia a day before estimated . ticked all the right boxes as far authenticity was concerned . so many reviews out there about fakes . buy directly from amazon lcc . i picked up a 52mm over here but they were a tad too small , hence this pair . my wife is now enjoying the 52mm pair now . my glasses were slightly defective and needed a trip to the optical shop to get fixed , i opted to do this as a return ( from overseas ) and reorder was a bit of a drama for me . i contacted amazon regarding this and they sorted out the cost of the repair . all my emails were responded to very promptly as was the refund for the repair . the sunnies are all good now . go the extra and get the polarized ones , your eyes will thank you in the long run . if you can ' t decide on the size , go down to the mall and try both the 52 or 55mm out , everyone is different so no point reading reviews for this . at the end of the day i think ray ban ' s quality control needs a tune up , they should test the glasses more stringently if the expect people to pay top dollar before they the factory . i still like the classic look and polarized is the only way to go for me . i would have opted for the rubberized frame version but they unavailable at the time . even though there was some drama with the sunnies , i must say amazon ' s customer service was excellent . maybe i just got a lemon but i still recommend getting these sunnies directly from amazon . after all , they have the best price in town . hope this helps . 
these are great glasses . they look good and are optically perfect . i have alotof different styles of wayfarers and theseare myfavs . 
i love those sunglasses . they look very elegant and are not to big . the shape of the glasses is nice . i would definitely buy them again . 
i fell in lust with these in black on beige frame / green solid lens for $ 130 at my eye dr ' s last week . pros : style ! many color combos , frame for smaller face / sits out away from cheek , price ~ 60 % off retail and ray - ban . com , green g - 15 lens has excellent color contrast in bright light ( ask old pilots re g15 ) cons : smaller frame design means less eye / skin protection , not suitable for sports , not polarized at this price , overall poorer lens quality compared to older wayfarers and most other brands , fakes reported here on amazonfit : size 52 mm is great on my ~ average - sl . narrow face ( female , us , cauc ) with a small nose bridge . i have to hunt to find plastic glasses with built - in nose pieces that don ' t slide down my nose . this is open boxy style is less slanted than orig and is less likely to hit your cheek than other styles . this is not a one - size - fits - all frame ; best to try it on someplace if you can , esp guys , or order both 52 and 55mm and return . not meant to be worn for sports . style / color : classic done better , loved the ~ cream / black w / green lens combo , many more fun combos availablewarranty : just 30 days vs others brands 1yr ( oakley ) - 2yr ( maui jim , serengeti ) . offical warranty says : return authorization ( ra ) number within 45 days of receipt of product . the product must be returned within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the ra number . price : ~ 60 % of retail $ 130 . polarized lens are $ 50 more . lightning deal again tomorrow ! fake ? : there are reviews re ray - bans they bought here were fake . i posted questions to some reviewers asking how they could tell they were fake but didn ' t get a response . there was a green / gold ray - ban sticker that annoyingly covered part of the left lens if that helps . ( it could be faked ) . to see official sticker , click on size : 52 and choose 3rd color down " black frame / green solid lens " to see the official sticker that was on the glasses at the eye dr ' s last week . the color that is shown is actaually the " black on beige frame / solid green lens " i want ; it is correctly listed with photo under 55mm . i would really like for someone to speak up ! other companies like oakley have a form to " report fakes " . lens : oakley , maui jim , serengeti , persol have much better quality lens . seems like since bausch & lomb ; sold the company late 90 ' s . older lens were higher quality . these ( - ) polarization seem murky compared to other brands . i did not buy these . after i looked out the window then walked outside i was blown away by the difference in quality - signs , cars , people - everything was so much clearer through maui jim ' s i tried on last . the more $ polarized ray - bans are better but still can ' t touch the clarity , sharpness , color through mj . the warranty , special uv , anti - scratch coatings sealed the deal . these are still way cool ! wish i ' d bought these from amazon , ditched the lens and ordered rx lens online . it ' s the need for special lens and pressure / convenience to buy while you are there at the eye doctor ' s office . . . next time ! 
these are classic ray - bans made in italy . they are authentic with case and lens cloth . i have these in black , too , and love them ! 
i purchased these in 52 mm from amazon because i ' m a petite girl and based on the reviews here , 55 mm seemed too big for me . when i received them , they fit my face ok but then i went to sunglass hut to try on the 55 mm and that one looked even better ! everything else about these ray - bans ( quality , the way it looked ) was great except the size . i decided to exchange my 52 mm for the 55 mm . amazon told me to return my old pair and make a new order . however , the price increased only a week after i purchased mine and amazon was very nice to honor the old price that i paid . i love amazon ! i would recommend trying it on in store before buying if possible . 
i purchased these for my son . he is 17 and saw the exact same glasses for $ 50 . 00 more at a merchant . he used his phone to take a pic . of tag , and then we found them at our go to shopping of choice amazon ! ! as usual , fast , well priced prime item . i have been a faithful amazon shoppers for years . great glasses ! btw teenagers don ' t want the & # 34 ; old school & # 34 ; aviator type . 
these product are original , i am a guy with normal size of face and the 52 mm fit just perfect , i was worried before for some reviews in this matter , so the best thing you can do is try out in the store if you can , if you have doubts . i had the original wayfarer in the past and i think this model is even better in looks , designed and fit . 
being a purist , i hesitated in buying these , since i had a pair of the original wayfarers , also in black , but after trying these on , i was impressed . unlike the originals , which have deep lenses that cover most of my cheek and can actually get uncomfortable , these are more lightweight and cover just enough of the face . they still are sturdy , and still have that classic look . a good option for women and persons with a smaller face who feel lost in the originals . 
bought these for my mother in law , she was a very happy camper . they are so cute & they are authentic 
i have a small frame so the classic wayfarers are a little too big for me . this is just perfect . i can wear with anything and it looks good . i bought the black frame with black lenses . it is definitely worth buying an original since the quality of the lens is infinite times better . i bought this a while back and they have not scratched or broken , i think this is a record for me . the case on the other hand . . . the tip of the flap below the button has snapped off . a little disappointed . i wish i could buy just the case since i prefer a hard case to a soft one since the glasses live in my overstuffed purse and protects it better . 
great glasses . fit perfectly . i ' m a pretty large headed guy and the 55mm ' s fit perfectly . they are authentic & # 34 ; made in italy & # 34 ; units with the rb watermark on the lens . i thought they might be a little & # 34 ; too lightly tinted & # 34 ; for sunglasses , but i live in san diego and they are great sunglasses . super happy with them ! 
so , i got these because for years i ' ve spent hundreds of dollars on sunglasses , they always wear out and start to break after 13 months . these were a & # 34 ; recommended for you & # 34 ; offer , on amazon , and many of my friends like them , so i figured i ' ll try them . i opened the box , the inner box itself ( the ray ban box that the actual glasses were in ) was torn to shreds so the glasses fell out and i stepped on it , oops . but it was fine , they were in a case , but the fact they were fine blew me away . they fit really well , they look great , and they seem strong , i ' m really happy amazon turned me onto these . 
i love these ray bans and was a bit confused on where to buy matte black on black . i read reviews that the green lens are in fact black , this is the case and are quality sunglasses . came in ray ban case with lens wipe . 
i originally bought the 52mm and quickly realized it was a mistake ! those are two small if you are a guy ! get the 55mm ! ! ! 
excellent build quality ; made in italy , glass lenses ( with the g - 15 - xlt lenses ) , plastic is solid and feels quality . timeless look . it ' s nice to have non - polarized lenses sometimes , less visual artifacts . 
great product . they even fit my giant head . my wife says that the lenses are smaller than other wayfarers , but i think that ' s mostly because she ' s used to seeing oversized glasses . a lot of reviewers said that they think the glasses they got are fakes . my order was fulfilled by amazon and the glasses appear to be real . 
the sunglasses is good but it ' s kind of hard to decide which size you wear , unlike aviator ones you can actually alter the shape of the frame , this one is plastic so won ' t do that . the only thing that is bad about it . 
fit a little small but very for sure ray ban quality 
i have always loved these glasses since president kennedy made them famous at those yacht races up in hyannesport mass . but i am much bigger than kennedy was and with a size 7 1 / 2 hat size they are just to small for me . ray - ban makes the model 4147 in a 60 mm lens , that i cant say enough about . so why cant they make the wayfarer in the larger size ? there are a lot of us out there who would buy them in the 60 mm size . jc 
a christmas gift for my daughter that arrived in record time and in perfect shape . very cool classes that i didn ' t know were on so many famous faces in recent history . 
great glasses , i live in central florida where we wear sunglasses just about every day of the year and these ray - bans are the best , this particular pair have been around for many years and have been my personal favorite for about 25 years ( although i have others ) as my gradmother and ( father ) used to say : don ' t skimp on your feet or your eyes . . . . . . 
i bought imitation sunglasses and ended up with peeling of the tortoise shell off the glasses and problems all around . this was worth getting . they are the real thing . 
these are a perfect fit . i have a medium to large face , and these look great . quality , great styling , great sun protection . 
i recently purchased this pair of wayfarers and a pair of ray - ban aviators . i can give the same review to both pair of glasses and that is , that i have nothing negative to say about the glasses . the construction seems to be durable since the frames don ' t rack under torsional stress and the hinges have a very solid feel . they sit very comfortably on the nose and aren ' t too tight behind the ear . all of the designators of authenticity are there , as is to be expected with a pair or ray - ban ' s sold by amazon . overall , i would suggest to a friend and would have no issue with buying another pair again in the future . 
a christmas gift for my spouse . the price was right and it arrived quickly . what more could i ask for ? 
a gift for my husband and he really likes them . they are comfortable and the lens is even darker than pictured . . . that ' s a plus . they are sturdy , yet comfortable . 
i ' ve been wearing the rb2132 for decades . i use them both for regular prescription and sunglasses prescription . they are classic . 
love these sunglasses . i often have trouble with sunglasses being too narrow and squeezing my temples , but the 52 mm ones fit me just fine . the only problem i have is that they slide down my nose and never stay up , especially if i ' m at all sweaty . i ' ve never had that problem with sunglasses before . 
i got these for my brother for christmas . ray bans look good on any type of face shape . these ray bans are really cool and he wears them all the time . i recommended polarized because of his frequent trips to colorado and the snow and sun glare that accompanies mountains . this style didn ' t come polarized . he decided he still liked them and would get a cheaper pair of polarized glasses that he could drive or ski in . 
loved them so much - we bought two pairs ! a very classic pair of sunglasses that will never go out of style ! 
i got these for someone else as a gift , and i was hesitant to get them at first because i wasn ' t sure why the lens is described as ' green ' but they don ' t really look green . they are great , classic looking sunglasses . definitely recommend them . 
just got mine recently and from the looks of it , it looks authentic , all the ray ban logos are on the right places and the build quality is excellent . click here for my video review : [ . . . ] 
i tried a million different sunglasses on before settling on this pair . i tried several different sizes , as well . i am not that small of an individual ( i do have a small nose , but not to an extreme or anything ) , but the regular size wayfarers and original wayfarers fell off my face ! these fit great , the lenses are awesome , and the design looks cool . tons of reviews say the 52mm are child size , but they fit me perfectly . if you have a store that sells ray - bans near you ( i wish i had and this would have taken a lot less time to figure out ! ) , i would try the sizes and models on and then come to amazon to get a great discount on legit sunglasses ! 
since we gave our son a new truck for christmas , the & # 34 ; shades & # 34 ; that he wanted were exactly what he needed to top off the package ! 
i got this as a gift for my best man . i already have a pair and i love them . they look good with almost everything and almost every situation . i looked around for a long time trying to find the best price / value , and this was definitely it . these are definitely authentic as well . 
the reviews kept mentioning that these ray - bans were knock offs . there is no way amazon . com is going to allow that . these came in the mail in two days and were perfect . the vision with the ray ban lenses is amazingly clear , the style is very nice and the price can ' t be beat . i bought the 52s and they are perfect for a male with a smallish face . 
i have sun damage so these are just what the doctor ordered . love the fit which is perfect and works for my facial shape . 
these glasses are super fresh . i have the small wayfarer with the orange and purple . i have yet to see anyone else wearing them . everyone wears the black wayfarers and its becoming too generic , but these ones allow you to enjoy the style of a wayfarer while still looking original . i ' m guessing these glasses are unisex , i ' m a guy and i don ' t think they look too feminine . i ' m always getting compliments on them . for a $ 125 bucks they ' re pretty awesome . the lenses are not too dark from the outside so people can see a good amount of your eyes . sometimes people ask me if they ' re sunglasses or just regular glasses . looking out from them its great because the lenses aren ' t too dark so you can see a good amount of light and color for non - polarized sunglasses . the only reason i wouldn ' t recommend them is so that i can be the only one who has them . 
they were much cheaper than , say sunglass hut . i have a small face and can ' t wear 52 in the old wayfarers but these are perfect . wayfarers don ' t go out of style . they come with case and rag in rayban box . love them . 
having owned b & l ; ray ban sunglasses for d e c a d e s ( still own them and actually worth crazy dollars ) and purchased knock offs at flea markets ( better than whatever is passing as $ 100 sunglasses now ) i will tell you that the only other weaker thing is the case they come in . whew what happened to quality . wish i would have thought about weighing them before i sent them back . needless to say , here are my glasses which have lasted decades , something these would never do . http : / / www . etsy . com / listing / 110895449 / vintage - ray - ban - bausch - and - lomb - diamond ? ref = similar_items_sashpurchased at a sunglasses hut kiosk in 1991 for $ 125 , and my wayfarer 5024s i purchased in the 90 ' s at drug emporium for $ 45 which are $ 100 used today ! just watch a few you tube vids on people getting shanked before you buy these . it makes one wonder , if they can actually produce counterfeits so cheaply what are you paying for when you get the original ? do your homework or know what you are buying . they were in a ups drop box the next day . 13june13apparently b & l ; now make junk . this have not be confirmed by me , but my girl ( who i purchased these for on amazon ) was in a sunglasses store , and while she was speaking with the owner about returning the pair he had for $ 180 , he confirmed that this is the " new " composite materials they now use . i will never buy ray ban again , or recommend them . i will however continue to take wonderful care of my existing ones that were made with quality materials over 2 decades ago . if i get in a store and remember i will post my findings . 
i bought this because i lost mine a few weeks ago . i purchased the lost pair back in january from sunglasshut for over $ 200 for the polarized version . i came accross this here and thought i would try it since it ' s fulfilled by amazon , i couldn ' t lose : - ) i ' m glad i did , not only that it ' s genuine and original , i saved $ 75 ! you will not be disaapointed . 
i had the rubber frames before and lost them . i replaced them with these and i am very happy . i prefer the smaller frames int he new wayfarer . 
bought these shades because they are awesome . didn ' t want to pay the department store prices so i looked on amazon . got them for $ 100 ! way cheaper then what the mall stores wanted . i love these things . now i ' m looking at buying the matte finish ones too . 
i bought these for christmas presents for a 24 year old guy , 16 year old guy and a 24 year old girl . they all had a screaming fit over them . it was their favorite gift . i got the girl red and the guys black . the girls are a little big even though i bought a smaller size than the guys , so you may want to research that problem . she wont let me send them back because she doesnt want to part with them . they look so cool and old school cool . i got them at least 40 dollars cheaper by getting them through amazon and i even seen them 80 more dollars on some sites , so they are a bargain . they are packaged perfectly with cleaning rag and tags tucked in an awesome case . the guys case was black and the girls brown . awesome gift for any age and you will be a hero for giving them . 
this fits me better now that i lost some weight and my face got skinnier . before , i looked like a chipmunk with really tiny glasses on . it even fit my 4 years old ' s face better than mine . 
i wanted the longer ones and didn ' t realize i bought these kinds . definitely try them on at stores before ordering online to see which compliment your face more . although i wanted the longer ones , maybe with my small face they would have overpowered my face . these are a more compact kind . the glossy finish is nice , these are the real deal . i got them for a great price and now i like them . 
i saw other reviews stating these didn ' t seem authentic . i disagree . they are perfect . the 55 mm fits an average adult face fine . i would by these again . 
i love these sunglasses ! i opted for the brown shaded lens instead of the black shaded lens . no glare , fit great ! 
these are my favorite glasses ; they stay on my head and the lenses keep the sun out well and still allow enough brightness . got these on sale for $ 80 , which i think was a good price as well ! 
just as i expected and the size was so true . at the beginnig i was afraid to buy this item by internet but at the end it was truth the description 
i ' ve always been a fan of ray - bans , and these are classic in style . i received them within two days of ordering them and they come with their own case and everything . i have a funky schedule for school and most of the time , when i go home the sun is right up in my face , these shades handle all of that with no problem . they ' re great shades and they ' d make a great gift . 
i ' m 44 years old , my face is very small , so i read the reviews and took the chance . they came a little bit too open , so they were very loose , so i took them to a store and they gladly closed them a little , so they now are perfect ! 
i ' ve always had ray - bans and always liked the glass lenses . these are made of plastic lenses . i was surprised and disappointed . 
they ' re perfect for me bc i have a mall head and blonde hair . the original black wayfarers overpowered my face . 
they look exactly like the pic and they are the real deal . showed up reasonably quick and i dig my new bans . thanks 
i am a woman with small oval face and these shades look amazing on me i am 5 ' 4 and ordered the 52 mm . elegant and beautiful color . 
stylish and protection from the sun . what more can you ask for ? i have two pairs . one that i keep in my car and another that i keep in my truck . i reserve the oakley ' s for around the neighborhood . . . 
the glasses are stylish and nice , then way you ' d expect any other rayban to be . the only problem is , they make a creaking sound each time i move the plastic part around , so when i move the parts to fit over your ears before i put it on , it always creaks and makes a noise as if the plastic is grinding together / rubbing against each other . i heard other rayban users have had this problem too . 
first off i ' d like to say that i love ray - ban wayfarers . i bought my first pair in the early 80 ' s and was hooked . but that was back when ray - ban was owned by bausch and lomb and therefore the lenses were produced by bausch and lomb , a company who is synonymous with eye health . hence , the quality of the lenses was top notch and crystal clear . in 1999 bausch and lomb sold ray - ban to an italian company and since then the lens quality is just not the same by a long stretch . i now own both ray - bans and serengetis and the lens quality of the serengetis are far superior . trust me when i say it pains me to say this about my beloved ray - bans , but i find myself grabbing my serengetis more and more often for the clarity of the lenses . 
these really cool retro sunglasses fit well , are comfortable and provide excellent uv protection . we have three pairs within our family . 
work well and look nice . i get tons of compliments on the glasses . my only small issue is that they tend to slide down my nose in warmer days . might just be the shape of my face ? 
i bought these for my wife . the first pair we got were way to big for some reason . she was born in korea from both korean parents , so she does not have the nose ridge like an american . these would slide off her nose and wouldn ' t grab on to her ears . we sent them back and we were sent another pair . the new pair fit like a glove and she wears these everywhere she goes . 
ray - ban rb2132 new wayfarer sunglasses , black frame / g - 15 - xlt lens , 55 mm came in quickly and was a wonderful gift for my daughter . she loves it 
quality glasses . very nice . since i have a somewhat narrow face and need 134 - 135 arm i figured i ' d give these a try . no go . they are really just for kids 
feels great , awesome shades . fits perfect . would recommend to anyone interested in purchasing . ray - ban is the true classic sun glasses 
i ordered these black frames for my son to save him money . perfect fit at 52 . in the optometrist ' s office the same frames were $ 180 , i paid $ 79 through amazon . they came in perfect condition , in a nice box with cloth , case , and booklet . they had all the right markings so i knew they were real ray bans . i did order prescription lenses ( polycarbonate / crizal ) from the optometrist and the glasses look great . i haven ' t tried ordering prescription lenses online yet . he is very happy with them . another great experience with amazon . i would highly recommend these new wayfarer frames by ray ban . 
great glasses that provide good visual acuity . no distortion from the plastic lenses . i wish these had crystal clear glass lenses , but for plastic , i ' m happy . these stay on your head even when you sweat because the temples wrap - around the back of the ear . i ' d like to see small nose pads on the to further assist the frames from remaining on a sweaty face , however . i got the real deal on amazon ; not a fake that others report in reviews . compared them to the same model in sunglass hut . the frame bottom being slightly rounded lets in a little light so if you are sensitive to the sun , this style may not be for you . interestingly , these look like costco ' s kirkland signature glasses that cost under $ 30 . i wouldn ' t be surprised if luxotica ( ray ban manufacturer ) made the kirkland signatures . 
i know there is a lot of question as to whether or not these are real or not . i can ' t comment on every pair but i can comment on mine . for 55mm ray ban new wayfarer polarized the price i paid is very low so i was a bit sceptical . right out of the packaging i was dissapointed . the silver ray ban box they came in was obviuosly used before . the sticker everyone says to look for was pealed off and replaced with a sticker that looked like it came from a home printer . this caused me to run it through every test i could find . after doing that , i have to say i feel they are 100 % genuine . all the logos are in the right places , the quality is excellent , did the polarization test and they are polarized . did the sunlight / camera test and saw the metal rod running through the arms . the actual ray ban case , book and cleaning cloth passed all quality tests . this review loses one star because the box should have been new with an original ray ban sticker and another star because there is a small scratch on the top of the sunglasses . it ' s not a large enough scratch for me to go through the trouble of returning and getting another but , come on , right out of the box they should be flawless . not sure why they weren ' t . 
it ' s been a great product and the quality of the material excellent , the price more cheap than local sellers . keep good work , i hope take my bussinnes next time . 
i ordered 3 pairs : black , polarized , 55mm ; tortoise , non - polarized , 52mm ; tortoise , non - polarized , 55mm , so i was able to compare the sizes , colors and polarized feature of these glasses . here we go . 1 . authenticity : all of the 3 pairs were sold by amazon . com , and they all seemed genuine to me . not even a doubt . solid and clear . i did notice that the black pair was missing the engraved " rb " on the back of the left lenses . i don ' t know why . 2 . polarized : the polarized feature doesn ' t bother me at all in reading lcd screens , nor does it improve the view much ( it cuts out a little more light , but not much difference ) . 3 . sizing : i am a small guy and have narrow face . the 52mm is definitely for children : a bit tight ( even for me ) and looks like a toy ; the 55mm looks great , although i feel they can be loose sometimes ( look good , but wear loose ) . i strongly recommend 55mm if you have to get these , unless you are buying for your kids . 4 . looks : they both look great , but i prefer the tortoise ones that are a little bit different but not too special . another thing to note is that other people can see your eyes more easily through the ordinary lenses than the polarized lenses . 5 . comparison to the originalwayfarer ( 2140 ) : later i got a pair of 2140 ( original wayfarer , 54mm , tortoise color ) for my cousin . the original wayfarers are a bit more expensive , but feel they are of better quality : stronger metal hinge , thicker and heavier plastic . size - wise , the original wayfarers are between the 55mm and 52mm new wayfarers . style - wise , the original wayfarers have a larger angle pointing forward . try them out in store and buy them here ! great quality and price . just make sure they are " sold by amazon . com " after you make the selection ( there are many different sellers on amazon ) . cheers ~ ~ ~ btw amazon says free returns on these , and they didn ' t even ask a word when i returned two pairs and paid for return shipping . great customer service . 
these glasses work great - block an appropriate amount of sun and they are very fashionable . couple things to note : - the 52mm lenses are much smaller than they seem compared to the 55mm . if you have a small face , definitely go with the 52mm . - expect to see some light from the top or bottom of these glasses - these aren ' t made to completely block all light . - if you have light colored eyes , i highly suggest getting the polarized version of these glasses . - also , if you have a narrow face , expect these to fall off if you look down . overall , i greatly enjoy this product ! i would recommend it to anyone . 
i received it yesterday , and to my delight , i got what i wanted in perfect condition , the glasses are authentic . look real cool with them on too 
i don ' t know if the other reviewers who say these are fake are either stupid or just got fake sunglasses , but the ray ban ' s i got are real . i would wager the people who say they got " fake " ray ban ' s don ' t know what they are talking about or just trying to scare people . go ahead and buy from here if you want ray ban ' s . amazon has a good return policy if you don ' t like them . 
these are good , but i wish i had gotten the polarized versions of these instead . that ' s my only & # 34 ; complaint & # 34 ; . other than that , go run around in a button up shirt and whitey - tighties while sliding across the floor in your socks . . . 
i really love my new ray - bans . the seller sent me a darker lens than i had ordered , but actually i like the added protection for my eyes . i finally bit the bullet and bought a nice pair of shades . there really is a difference between good sunglasses and cheapies . 
i picked these up for about $ 85 and they were definitely worth the price ! my only qualm is that the lenses are a little lighter than they probably should be . the tortoise is a good look and goes with pretty much everything , though , and i definitely recommend these . 
can ' t get much better or more classic than the wayfarer . these things aren ' t like those jose canseco oakleys that were only cool for a couple years and will never ever be cool again . ever . at least i hope . wayfarers are classic , you can ' t go wrong . 
this is my second pair , i wore the first pair for over 5 years and still have them ( as a back up ) . they are sturdy and fashionable . 
he actually gets complimented on them often . the size is a little tricky . i would go with these for your average man , but if he has a big head go bigger than 55 mm . 
i have to admit i was somewhat reluctant to pay the dollars i did for these ray - ban new wayfarer sunglasses , but i am glad i did . first of all , amazon offered a discounted price and then there is the rest . the glasses are polarized and the optical clarity of these lenses is astounding . i didn ' t know what i was missing . i can see more details and the blue gradient lenses are very useful . the glasses are comfortable and fit my face just right . they come in both 52 and 55 mm lens diameter and i chose 55 mm because i have a larger head . the design of the new wayfayer fits the average face better and the sunglasses are very attractive . the best thing about these sunglasses is the optics . you have to see it to believe it . definitely order the polarized model . 
daughter in law very happy for her christmas present and i am happy that she is happy . it ' s funny how they are making their way back into our lives . wish i had held onto mine from like 20 years ago ! ! 
these sunglasses feature design , ray ban quality and a perfect finish . the price is quite adequate and the product is excellent . 
these are geat sunglasses - comfortable , well made , durable . this is my first pair of very nice , somewhat expensive ones since i typically lose or break them pretty quickly , but the price was unbeatable and the quality is worth it ! 
these sunglasses fit my boyfriend , my sister and me . these look good on anyone , can ' t go wrong . the quality is exceptional and the price can ' t be beat on any other website ; i tried . 
exactly like the description . real polarized ray ban wayfarers . i wish they made them in wider sizes , but these work okay for my big head , and i love ' em . 
i really wanted to like these , but . . . you should try them on in the store first unless you ' ve worn them before . i bought the large and they were still too small for my face . the ear pieces do not flex much - - there is no spring in the hinge area . and if you ' ve been wearing aviator styles with thin frames around the lenses these will be a shock . the thick lens frames will feel like you are trying to look around the center post that separates the windows in your car . they create a blind spot of sorts . if you can live with that - - no worries . they are a great traditional style . just be sure the size fits you as to width across the face . 
i love the sunglasses . however , it took almost a month to finally get the right pair . the first pairs i received had very loose hinges . usually i wouldn ' t be so picky but i have to be for the price i paid . 
you can never go wrong with ray ban . stylish , comfortable , worth every penny ! got them on a good deal for my hubby , will purchase another pair for myself ! 
these glasses have a different look . the matte blue color is definitely trendy . just be prepared to be able to pull it off . . . . 
i did not expect it to be this small . but it is very light . i have yet to see its durability . 
have been wearing wayfarers since the late 70s . this updated design is both modern and classic . love the glasses and how i look in them . 
these are great ! super stylish , great fit , and high quality lenses . i am more than pleased and at such a great price ! 
i originally purchased these in hi back in 2007 . they broke a few years later and i immediately got another pair . those where lost in a rental car a few years later , and i immediately purchased another pair . my advice is to try them on in a store and purchase here on amazon . i think i like them so much because they wrap around my face and offer superb protection . hands down , the best , sunglasses i own . i think my next pair will be the matte version , however , i cant seem to find those polarized . 
i had little knowledge on the sizes , for a woman i ' d say these look and fit perfect . they don ' t fall off when i bend over . sexy look , i got them in black and love them ! 
i had to return these ray - ban sunglasses , they were way to big for my small face . i reordered a different pair . 
initially i bought one pair for my brother . when they arrived ( together with other items i bought from amazon ) , i asked my husband to try them on . they looked good on him and he liked them because they were very good in the sun . so , i ordered another pair for him . he simply loves them esp when he ' s driving . very good sunnies . highly recommended . would like to get a pair myself . 
had for over a year not a single complaintnot the most gental person with glasses and these have heldup fine 
i am not knocking the seller . i recently got my first batch of contacts and needed some polorized sunglasses to use . i purchased this set and the quality is awesome , very sturdy . the only problem i had were that the top of the glasses was low to let light in . even though i would raise them high on my nose . i need some top coverage on my glasses since i drive a lot . i returned this pair . i purchased oakley straight jackets and that pair i love . 
these glasses reflect the excellent standards that ray ban sets for their products . they feel like a quality product that will last a long time . 
got a pair of these about a month ago . they ' re very cool . many compliments and inquiries regarding these glasses . 
if you gonna buy a pair of sunglasses , buy ray - ban - - whatever style you fancy . slick , elegant and priceless . just wish my head weren ' t so big , but that does not detract from the quality of these sunglasses . look at the world through those polarized lenses - - and you will never take them off again ! 
these glasses fit perfectly . these were a replacement for another pair of ray - bans that were broken by a friend . i thought i was getting polarized lenses , but they weren ' t . i was a little disappointed . i must ' ve clicked the wrong one . 
this jacket is a nice jacket it came in a woman ' s fit extra - large as that is what i ordered and i also bought shirts that were extra - large but in a junior fitso maybe need to specify that it is an women ' s size 
love this black warm up jacket . i have two and the other is white . i can pair with anything with these two standard colors . fits great ! great material no ironing after washing needed if removed promply . 
this jacket is good size , plenty long enough , has many pockets , washes well , dries easily , stain resistant and sturdy . recommended ! 
did like the color and quality of the product just for me ran small . would buy again the next size . 
a very good warm up jacket . fits well . always need to size down with dickies scrubs . i would recommend this jacket . affordable 
sturdy seams , strong fabric , no loose stitching . a bit larger than i thought it would be , butthat ' s not a fault in a jacket . . . fulfilled a dress code requiring white tops and still let me sneak inthe occasional white - based light print scrub top underneath . . , and added2 more roomy pockets for all my assorted nurse stuff and pencollection . . . great product ! 
liked the design of these jackets with the pockets and slit on the sides thing . color didn ' t thrill me because it is so blah but that ' s what the employer wants , they get . good quality compared to shirts i got and pants too . ran just right size wise . 
i brought this in a size too big and washed it once and lined dried and it still shrunk . but its still a nice jacket . 
this white scrub jacket fit nicely and amazon exchanged it for me with no hassle as always . i did like the cherokee jacket better though . it got 5 stars instead of 4 . 
same as others . should have listened to the other reviews . a little bigger than i expected , but ok . big pockets for all my things . thanks ! 
washable , no ironing needed , inexpensive and neutral colors available . i going to get another one . one warning it gets hot in the summer . 
i purchased this jacket several months ago and have worn it countless times . it ' s comfortable , washes well and does not fade . i also have the matching pants , which are just as comfortable . i would highly recommend this product . 
durable and comfortable . i usually wear a small shirt / jacket size . the small is roomy enough to comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt or regular scrub top under it . 
seriously , i wear an xs normally - this xs could fit two of me in it . i ' m not surprised by the material being rough and stiff ; i have the classic dickies v - neck scrub top and the material is the same and i actually find that that is what makes it more durable over time . as for dickies yes , they normally run a little larger or baggier in areas , but this jacket really is absurd . if you are a small framed person , this will most definitely look like a large glades trash bag on you . 
like these pants . good for the price . comfortable . they were a little on the big side . i ordered a large which i usually ordered , but they seemed a little big . which can be good . . . or bad ! would recommend . 
basic scrubs , but somewhat disappointing purchase because the listing doesn ' t state that they are giving you the eds variety . these are good solid scrubs that hold up well to wear and tear . but beware if you are on the heavy side , the material has no stretch at all , until the normal scrubs . so while i can normally wear a medium , these are uncomfortably tight . good quality overall and fast shipping , but be careful with the sizing . 
have been buying these scrub pants locally , but it is such a hassle to run by the store before they close at 5 : 00 p . m . these are the same items and now all i have to do is click and buy and two days later , they are on my front porch . the landau quality is obvious with these scrubs and they almost never wrinkle after drying . thank you amazon ! 
if you are under 5 feet 3 inches these have a great leg length . if you are any taller they will be too short . they do run large . size down 
i really liked this scrub nice fit and nice quality material also , i liked getting my scrubs at a reasonable price also , thank you , 
the workmanship is good , and the fabric is good , but i found that the legs were a bit too long , and the rise was a bit too shallow . i know how to lengthen the rise ( and shorten the length of the legs in the process ) , so for me it ' s not a problem , but if you don ' t sew , be aware that the legs are a bit long , and the waistline rides much too low on the hip . but , that might be just me ; fit is such a personal thing . 
did not fit well , was too small , the pant has good material and i like the product . i would tell others about the product . 
i have been a nurse for 30 years . my primary field has been ed . until 4 months ago i wore the white dickies painter pants . the fit my needs were comfortable and long lasting . recently the new cno decided that we should have a uniform appearance . i researched scrubs to find the ones that would fit my needs . these do . my walkie goes in the right leg pocket ( perfect fit ) my trauma fiskars go in the left top leg pocket leaving the lower pocket free for a shopping list when i go to supply . the three belt loops allow me a belt for my multi tool and key clip . the zipper cuts down on time when the diuretic kicks in . the fabric is heavier than some other scrubs i have seen and i had no shrinkage on the first wash and dry cycle . to top it all off they keep me looking like a professional . if you are and ed nurse or a hard working nursing supervisor i highly recommend these scrub pants . 
comfortable ! i can wear these everyday . . . & i do because i brought about 6 pairs in a variety of colors for work ! 
i was surprised by the great quality but didn ' t realize the pants were low cut . i sent them back , too bad . 
i am in nursing administration . i have to look professional . looks really good and fits great . i would recommend them to anyone . 
i love love love these pants ! i own several colors of this type of dickies pants . i love the elastic band in the back , which gives it a bit of a stretch . but i also like that it has a drawstring to adjust the tightness at the waist . i own these pants in a x - small petite size , and the cut is perfect ! the length is just right without the back part dragging on the floor ( gross ) . and the cut is flattering . unlike other brands , where my legs are still swimming in a size x - small . these have enough leg room , yet form nicely to my legs and butt without it being too loose or too tight . i also love the cargo pocket on the right thigh . it allows me to place heavier items if i don ' t feel like putting them in my scrub top pockets . the material is of good quality . i wash my scrubs after one use , every week , and i reckon these will last for a while . i can ' t say enough good things about these pants ! 
i love these . i ' ve got big hips and thighs and these pants have a modern fit without being cut so close to the skin that i look like i ' m about to hit the club ( i have this problem with a lot of scrubs ) . at the same time , they aren ' t cut like the one - size - fits - all scrubs that you see so many of that assume that the wearer has a giant , square butt that comes up to their shoulder blades . inexpensive , too . i wash these at least once a week and they ' ve been going strong since i bought them 6 months ago , no fading or obvious wear . 
i am not going to lie . . . these are the best scrubs out there . they are so comfortable , look great , and even better make you look like you have a figure . 
i like them . . they are long . . but everything is long for me . . . they will be long for most people though i am guessing . . but that is the way with shorts . . i love the fact that they have a zipper . . . i still don ' t know why every scrub pants don ' t have zippers . . . but for the price these are excellent . . . have just worn them for 30 minutes so far as i have to get them hemmed . . . but they feel comfortable . . . they are not the softest . . but i know that will change after a few washes . . . i would recommend them 
very pretty candy orchid scrubs . not very soft like a lot of dickies but hopefully after several washings they will soften . 
very bright , which took a little getting used to , but my patients love it . the m tall is a great length on my 5 ' 6 & # 34 ; frame ; i seem to have really long legs . i have a lot of room in them . 
if you are petite and want scrub pants that dont fall off dont get this pants . i ' m 5 ' 3 and 129lbs and i got an xs and they fall off . i have to constantly pull them up . it ' s a bit annoying , but other than that they are ok . 
good product , wash great , true to size . i ' m 5 ' 10 ( female ) and have a 34 inch inseam and these are perfect length . 
liked them - all i can say is don ' t throw these in the dryer ! they were worth the price but not very sturdy to heat . 
i usually wear petite small but this pair are too small . also i didn ' t realize that they are low - rise which i don ' t like especially for work . . . . just not fit for nursing movements at the bedside . also the cargo style of this particular one just does not fit me right . i ended up returning them and got full refund . 
light weight , not flimsy and is color fast . great fit too . has cargo multiple pockets on legs bilaterally that are practical in the way their situated , this makes them very useable . botton and fly adds sensiblility . dickies have array of colors to choose from as sell . 
my husband is an er nurse , and his er requires nurses wear navy - colored scrubs . dark colors fade so badly . we ' ve tried cheaper scrubs to save money . unfortunately , they faded horribly and didn ' t seem to look as good as long as these scrubs do . he ' s been an rn 12 years now , and despite trying several of the cheaper brands to save money , we ' ve always come back to these , and think these wear the longest and keep their color the best . 
i wouldn ' t say these are entirely one size larger than normal , i would say its about a 1 / 2 size larger than normal . it doesn ' t matter to me because i don ' t like things hugging me to death especially when i am trying to work ! i would recommend them ! 
hey they are white scrubs and are cost effective . they hem easy using stitch witchery ironing tape . they are comfortable . over all a good purchase . namaste ' 
the pants are pretty good by itself , unfortunately , the size chart was not clear enough and i bought one way too big , i cannot wear like it is , and have it tailored will cost me more than the scrub itself . there it goes my 18 bucks + s & h . . . damn it ! 
these scrubs pants are nice enough and fit as expected . the color is a little lighter than pictured . i would recommend them to anyone needing cheap scrub pants . 
the material is not bad , but the white scrub bottoms are so see - through it leaves nothing to the imagination , underwear or skin color . don ' t let the picture fool you , the fabric is less than paper - thin . don ' t waste your money . these are being returned . 
comfortable and flattering . makes my legs look longer and thinner . i am 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; with 27 in . waist and 33 in hips when not sucking in . i like the yello tie , too 
i bought 4 pairs of these pants / scrubs , black , olive , tan , and grey . 3 pairs are perfect . the black pair is labeled the right size , but it is actually a full size too small , or it shrunk way too much in the wash . i can still fit them thankfully , but i can only used them for office use . which defeats the point since i bought them to work on the floor with kids on asd spectrum . the other 3 pairs are awesome . they wash well , don ' t wrinkle , are slimming and look professional . i will order again but i ' ll double and triple check all the sizes before and after the wash , instead of just checking the label . 
excellent fit . gives you a feminine fit with room to maneuver . the length is good for someone who is short like me . i am 5 ' 0 & # 34 ; 
we tired of being asked if he was her son or my husband so i bought 3 sets of scrubs here on amazon . . . . no more identity questions . . . they look great and fit him well . . . i prefer black to blue or any color because i think it is more professional . . . nice quality at a great price . . . 
i was hoping these would soften up in the wash but so far they have not . i don ' t wear them but since i washed them , i can ' t return . i would if i could . 
i am short , 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; and it ' s hard for me to find petite pants that fit right . several brands of & # 34 ; petite & # 34 ; still drag on the floor or get caught on the back of my sneakers at work . these fit perfectly ! ! i love them so much i bought them in several colors . they are so comfortable . 
i have been on a mission to find scrubs that are durable , comfortable , and fit in an aesthetically pleasing manner ! these scrubs do not encompass most of these features . they are durable , but the fit is not ideal . they are too loose , around the waste , but they have the right length . as a result , i am constantly needing to retie the drawstring , since my pants are always falling down , which is not ideal in clinic . the cut is also not flattering . the material is not soft , and it can be irritating at the end of a long day . i have found other scrubs that i prefer ( greys anatomy scrubs by barco ) , so i won ' t be buying these again . they are generic and inexpensive , so they do their job , but i want scrubs that are more comfortable and fit better . 
very comfortable and a great fit . i would definitely recommend these to a friend or a family member due the comfort and durability . 
im 4ft 10 inches tall and was happy to find i didnt need to worry about hemming another pair of pants . theyre about an inch long on me but ill deal with it , im super petite in size . 
bought these in size medium for my husbands dr . shots costume for halloween . he ' s 5 ' 11 and 185 pounds . fit him perfectly ! 
ok , maybe i ' m the only one surprised at this . . . in trousers & jeans i am a solid size 10 so there was no way i would ever consider ordering a small unless the pants were unisex . these guys are long & loose , and i feel quite slovenly wearing them . in fact i feel so sloppy wearing them that i ' ve begun to over - accessorize ( just what the hospital needs , one more over - accessorized italian girl ) & am considering upgrading my gymshoes to a clog with a heel to just look more professional . if they were anything but scrub pants i would have probably taken them to the tailor to get sorted out . . . . but they have a drawstring , for goodness sake . . . . maybe dickies are just not for me as my experience with the scrub tops was just as meh . 
i am vertically challenge and this pants just fits right . the petite scrub is what i just needed without the extra cost of getting it hemmed for my height . 
just a tiny bit too long , otherwise excellent fit and quality . tried others since residency . i get only landau now . 
these pants are most definitely a more comfortable material but they run a tad too big . i do own a sewing machine so i was able to hem them by myself and that made me much happier with my purchase ! 
if you have to wear scrubs , at least wear these . they hold up wash afer wash and are comfortable for 12 hour shifts 
they are ok but they were not a good fitting for me . i think it might fit better on others . so thats why i gave it a 3 star cause they were not good for me . 
love theses scrubs . vey comfortable and easy care , may need light occasional ironing but usually not . great color verity . flattering fit . 
i love the way these bottoms fit . the elastic lining in the back is a great way to keeping the pants from sliding down . and i totally love the color ! 
this is a really cute scrub top . runs a little big though but i can still use when i ' m bloated or feeling fat days . arrived on time 
excellent fit for 6ft , 180lb man . material is a little coarse . . attracts cat hair and lint like crazy but maybe after a few washes that will diminish . i ' m pleased with these scrubs and would recommend . 
theses have great pockets for that extra room and wash and wear great . they are cool light fabric and soft not rough . great buy ! 
i ' m pleased with this purchase . as a plus sized woman it is difficult to find scrubs that are comfortable ( not to big , not to small ) . i will be ordering another pair shortly so that i have another pair for my clinical . i love the cargo pocket , i only wish it had cargo pockets on both sides . i ' m giving them five stars for the fit and color ( they match my scrub top perfectly ) . the drabacks are not having cargo pockets on both sides and there is no pocket in the back on the women ' s cargo pants ( i have a pair of men ' s that have pockets on both sides and a back pocket for money , credit card , etc . ) . 
dickies is great work wear . lasting color and durable as well . the fit is relaxed but not too loose . i will be getting another set . 
i love these scrubs . i will be purchasing more of them . the matching top is a great scrub too . lots of pockets in both of them . 
i have used these regularly for a year and they still look great ! durable and comfortable to wear . good buy . 
these scrubs arrived quickly . i had ordered them previously from another company , but amazon had them for quite a bit less money . plenty of pockets - - perfect for my nursing student son . 
altogether i now own 7 pairs of dickies scrub pants , 4 are part of a scrub set . they are well made , colors don ' t fade , seems don ' t come apart , material holds up to repeated washing and the rigours of my job . i purchased a few cheaper scrubs to save some money and ended up regretting it . you really do get what you pay for . i now use the cheap scrubs when i am painting or cleaning . no more cheap scrubs for this girl , paying a little more for scrubs that will last longer and fit better saves money in the long run . i have never regretted buying any of my dickies scrubs and i will buy more in the future 
these pants are really comfortable but still a tad too long for a petite size . i had to hem about 2 inches . . . my friend commented that they look like yoga pants . 
received this product a few weeks ago . used it several times already . its a compact umbrellas that folds up small . strong spring - loaded automatic opener and closer . the wind vents are very useful so the umbrella can withstand normal windy , rainy weather . quality construction is better than average as the & # 34 ; spokes & # 34 ; are thicker than the typical compact umbrella spokes that bend / break . highly recommend . 
i used to have a model made by sharper image and when i couldn ' t find it anymore , i went to this model . my biggest issue is the wind in my area and flipping my umbrellas inside out , always breaking the frame . this one has survived some abuse and it works great . 
i have used this umbrella a few times . the wind does little to affect it . bottom - line : works very well . light weight and compact . just has a blah color . . . . . so you know it ' s raining . . : ) 
shed rain is a excellent company , have used their products before and their umbrellas out last other umbrellas under normal use esp in the midwest . 
it ' s made of frp ( fiberglass - reinforced plastic ) . so , it ' s a plastic . supposedly to be of better quality and stronger - but it seems it bends pretty easy . one made with metal would do better . the handle is kinda small and might be difficult to hold it when the wind blows . i would keep it if it was no more than $ 20 . the good thing is that it ' s small and fits in my jacket ' s internal pocket . 
if you ' re looking for an umbrella that can protect you from the elements , this isn ' t it . while the design and construction both seem great , the umbrella is too flexible to function properly . a strong gust of wind will push in the sides of the umbrella , negating its usefulness , and i ' ve also had it turn inside out twice in the first week of ownership . definitely not what i was hoping for for three times the price of a cheap umbrella . . . 
these are super sexy without being too high . they run a half size big so account for that . they are a soft leather and they wear great ! 
these pumps are perfect ! i got them in multi . the heel was about 2 1 / 2 inches and were even prettier in person . love , love , love ! please make more multicolored low heeled pumps . i hate stilettos ! 
i am a nine west nuncio fan . this is one of those shoes that you pray they don ' t discontinue until you can afford to have every color . the heel is the perfect height for a day at work , but the pointed toe is sexy too . it takes me about a day to break them in to perfect comfort , but it is all worth it . 
i bought these pumps in november for wear with pantsuits , slacks , and dresses . i don ' t like extremely high heels because i am tall and also because i like to walk quickly ( i find very high heels to be a hinderance ) . i got them in black . they weren ' t too exciting but functional . or so i thought . . . i didn ' t wear them that many times - maybe twice a month maximum . i have 5 pairs of black heels counting this pair . notwithstanding this relatively infrequent wear , the plastic cap on the heel wore completely through to the metal by june ( yes - within 7 months of relatively infrequent wear ) . i wasn ' t pleased . normally i have a good experience with nine west shoes , so i was surprised . i wonder if one of my shoes was defective . 
these shoes are hot . i mean really , really hot . nice lines , great shape , perfect height . love them . and comfortable ! i want more in other colors ! 
this shoe is fabulous . nice soft lambskin leather . this pointy toe is the most comfortable . there is no discomfort when walking at all and i am 300lbs and the heel sustains me quite well . i wear size 11 with regular shoes and sandals but a 12 in closed to shoes . this is very sleek and professional an yet comfy and stylish enough to wear to church or to hang out . 
these shoes are so pretty and well made . the heel isn ' t too high and they are one of the most comfortable pairs of nine west shoes that i have purchased to date . 
these are cool , but they ' re not so thin as to be worthless - - about what you ' d expect from the illustration . good construction . no problems with loose buttons . half cotton and half polyester . i wish they were full cotton , but the polyester will make them last forever i guess . 
he is a former marine and he blouses the top and sleeps just fine . at least his pj ' s have plenty of material . 
washes and dries nicely , and my hubby looks good in it . i plan to buy him more such pj ' s as needed . 
these pajamas are good for every season except winter . they have survived the first washing with no damage , discoloration , or shrinkage . the collar is narrow ( i don ' t like collared pajamas ) and not too intrusive . i would recommend these pajamas . 
merchandise was shipped on a timely basis . the fabric of these pajamas is very flimsy , and the buttons were barely on the shirt . had to sew all the buttons on before my husband could wear them . do not recommend 
beautiful deep navy blue with white piping and buttons . a classic pajama set . size is precise . my only complaint is the top is cut straight from armhole to hem , no flair , no extra room . if you have a tummy : ) get the next largest size . large seems to be made for height of approx . 5 ' 8 " , so consider going up a size or to a tall , if you need longer bottoms . all in all , a typically exceptional izod product from a trustworthy flordia retailer . very satisfied ! 
my wife had one of these on our last trip and i got one for myself . it works great as a sling unit and hides well . i like the shallow pocket that serves to hold credit cards and such . 
extremely well made and i can see it lasting for many , many trips . the neck cord is easily adjustable and the average person should be able to wear it around their neck , waist , or cross - body . i ' m tall and thin and all three modes work for me , as they do for my average ( and proportionately ) sized husband . the cord is a twisted metal cable , sheathed in fabric , designed to prevent pickpockets from cutting and stealing the pouch while worn . it was stiffer than i initially expected , and a silk cord would be more flexible and comfortable to wear , though that would completely defeat the pouch ' s purpose . likely , i will wear it around my neck while breezing through the airport and around my waist or cross - body the rest of the time . the pouch will hold one ( maybe two ) passports , cash , and credit cards . it ' s not a purse , but a great pouch to secure basic valuables against your body . as a hardcore geek traveler , i give this product two thumbs up . 
this is a handy pouch designed to wear under your clothes to protect your valuables . my advice is to leave valuables at home if possible when traveling overseas . i did that and had no problems . a friend had her iphone stolen when it was set down on the table at a sidewalk cafe . i wore this at the airport under my clothes . don ' t do that ! ! i think i exposed some of my assets trying to remove it to get through security . lol ! 
i ' m not sure if the slash proof thing will really come in handy but it definitely provides peace of mind . my friends did make fun of me saying that instead of having my money stolen i ' d be choked to death instead if someone was really trying to steal my stuff . . . 
i need this product for when i go fishing to the beach or park i wear shorts sometimes they don ' t have pockets i put my money i ' d 
great secure pouch to wear under your clothing for security , breathable mesh on the back side to keep it cool against your skin . 
very good quality . it has just enough space to fit everything i need . i would buy it again . : ) 
i am excited to use this . i will be doing some travel in spain and you have to worry about pick pockets . i have heard they will also cut through the normal straps . if you have the wire inside the neck band they can ' t cut it . 
like the security but be aware that the most risky times for your info to be stolen is not while in your purse , but when you have it out while using it . equally risky are the info readers that that are illegally linked up to the machines that you swipe your card through . sooo with this you are helping you security but nothing is as fool proof that being said i would like this better if it could be thick enough to hold a larger phone and a thin card holder and a pear of thin reading glasses . just a 1 / 2 inch more interior width front to back would be outstanding . i can fit my cell plus a super thin credit card holder w / small change purse built in , . plus a pen . thin reading glasses do not fit . even with less in this it can be tight to get things in and out of it . hopefully the manufactures will make a new and improved version w / more wiggle room 
my cousin was looking for a safe wallet , when traveling abroad . . . i told her about this wallet from pacsafe and i purchased it for her and she loved it . 
i have a pacsafe purse i use most of the time once i am at my destination , but in transit and when i am engaged in more hands - on activities , i want to leave the purse behind , but have essentials with me . this bag is great for that purpose . the neck cord extends long enough to allow me to wear this cross body if i wish , but the shortened length is perfect to keep the pouch - and my valuables - securely out of sight . in either case , the cord rests comfortable on my neck . the zip compartment holds my passport easily ( mine was renewed in 2013 and is considerably thicker than the one that was issued 10 years earlier ) , but is not rfid , nor is large enough to hold an extra rfid sleeve - which is the only reason i didn ' t give it 5 stars . another compartment is shallow - but very nicely sized for credit cards and hotel key - cards . the third compartment is fully large enough for currency , cell phone , or even my nikon cool pix - but would be rather bulky holding all that . i plan to keep passport , boarding passes and credit cards / currency in the pouch during my overseas flight . judging by some of the activities my tour has planned , i will most likely use it cross - body for a good bit of our excursions . another great pacsafe item . 
bought this for my 5 year old nephew . he liked the fact that itis easy to put on and off . 
i bought this sandal for my active 4 year old with the hopes it will be less smelly than a similar pair i bought from oshkosh . i bought a size larger first , but they were too baggy / large . there is no toggle / bungee adjust for this pair , unlike the h2 model . i was very satisfied for the price - buying in february meant they were about 60 % less than retail ! we ordered both the black and the tan , and both are slick & # 34 ; leatherish & # 34 ; and more attractive than the cloth / canvas of keen h2s . both look like they can be hosed off as easily as crocs . they also look tidy enough to wear with his easter outfit . i am very pleased with this purchase and i will stalk this model in future for clearance / secret sales ! 
this was purchased as a replacement for my son ' s keen sandals . this was better than the h2 keen because it lets the foot breathe more . my son has a problem with sweaty feet in the h2 , it has been less of a problem with these . 
these shoes are great ! i purchased size 6 youth for myself ( i am women ' s size 8 . 5 ) and they fit perfectly ! exactly what i needed for my beach / adventure vacation . the youth colors were more fun ( and cheaper ) ! 
from reading reviews people said to size up but when they came in they were way , way too big . i sent them back and ordered the correct size my son is in now and they were still about a half size too big . 
my son just turned four and loves superman . he was so excited when we got this costume ! overall , it ' s pretty cute . he says he feels super strong with the built - in muslces , and has been running all over the house saving the day . pros : it seems fairly well made . my son has been wearing it around the house for a few days now , and i see no seem issues . cons : the sizing is a little off in our case . my son is tall for his age , and though this costume says small is for four to six year olds , there are a couple of inches hanging off of the boots - seems way too big for a four year old . the cape is also a little uncomfortable , as the weight drags it back against my son ' s neck . while running around the house i see him pulling at it frequently , but he doesn ' t want to take off his superhero cape ! 
this costume is great . awesome for the price . it is very detailed . it looks like it might not last long when you first see it but after many times my nephew has worn this the costume still looks great . he probably wears this and other costumes more than he does regular clothes . he is about to out grow it soon . since it is still in great condition we can probably pass it on to another family kid . 
nice superman costume . seems reasonably well built for the price . fit well and looked nice . don ' t think you can beat it for the price 
my 4 year old grandson was so happy to open his package and find the costume . he loves to dess up as one of the super heroes . i made a costume box for him at christmas last year and i just keep adding to it . when his friends come over they all pick a costume . most of the costumes have come from amazon and have lasted very well through lots of little boys putting them on and taking them off . 
this is a good deal for this costume . it ' s going for much more money on other websites . my son is 7 , wears size 7 tops and jeans . i ordered the medium sized costume and it fit perfectly ! 
i have not seen this on my nephew yet but the costume looks cute . i gave four stars because for the price it does seem a little & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; so i am hoping they will fit good . wish they made zipper backs for the price though ! 
i bought this for our 10 year old who is pretty tall and slim for his age . ( size 12 - 14 costume ) it is still a bit short in the legs . this is a common problem , so i won ' t judge too harshly there . one thing that is strange is the muscles on the upper body , though . they are not stuffed with cotton , but are actually stiff because there is a firm foam lining that part . they won ' t hold their proper shape because they came out of the package " smushed " and it held that same shape . my son isn ' t heartbroken over it , so it could be worse , but it does look really odd . one thing i did not like is that there were two layers of packing tape along the opening of the package that looked randomly placed , very much like someone had opened it then lazily resealed it with a couple lengths of tape . ( the way it was folded on the packaging supported this . the garment wasn ' t faced out , but rather simply stuffed inside . ) it was in no way factory - sealed . overall , it looks like it will last for the day ( unless he gets rough at recess ) and that ' s really the point anyhow . this is absolutely a case of the price being right for a one - time - use product ! 
just what i wanted , just in time for halloween . fit my 3 year old who is in the 30th percentile perfectly . there was definitely room for someone taller or shorter though . . . . hard to get off to go to bathroom by himself . still wearing it 2 weeks after halloween . it does snag easy but you get what you pay for ! the velcro on the cape is sewn on the wrong direction causing some rub on the neck . . . but superman forgets this very quickly : ) i will probably have to trash it in a few months but it was well worth it . 
this is the perfect costume to teach children blind allegiance to a fascist state and willingness to become a faceless disposable minion for the ambition of corrupt officials . 
i bought this item for my son . it basically looked just like the description shows . he seemed to enjoy wearing this costume . he commented that the mask should have been larger because in the photo it covers the whole face and head , but in reality it does not . also , at the bottom of the feet it did not cover the whole foot as shown in the picture . it was poorly made . somewhat like a piece of material with a strap of velcro . he said that besides these two minor mishaps , he would still recommend this costume to others . 
i got it for a my 4 y . o . grandson , we like it , but did not wear yet . all our grandkids want to wear star war costumes the year . i hope it will durable enough . 
my son wanted to be a trooper for halloween so i bought him this costume , it is well made and will last a few years . i llike how the feet covers the shoes . i had to cut the plastic on the mask so that he could see better , this was not as easy as it sounds . i had to use tin snips because the plastic was so hard . 
my son is almost 5 years old . i would say he is in a solid size 5 in cloths and this costume is pretty snug on him . he cannot wear anything underneath because it would be way too tight ! he like it though and it looks cute on . 
love love love ! the perfect costume for my grandson who plays in it on star wars play dates with his preschool pals . 
great fit , awesome details , decent pleather - ish material . . . not thin see thru nylon / polyester , one of the coolest batgirl ( or batman ) mask at this price point that i have ever seen . worth it . daughter loved it ! ! 
it is so real ! my 6 years dauhgter love this costume . it looks like leather but it is a kind of plastic very light and soft . superb 
i have to say , this costume exceeded my expectation . it is a black sheath dress with a cape that attaches by velcro . the belt is plastic and fabric and ties in the back . the boots also have velcro on the bottom so you can attach them to the child ' s shoe and the gloves are easy to put on . my only concern is the size - as i purchased for a 4 year old and it fits her just right ( no extra room ) although the size says 4 - 6 - but the bag says for a 3 - 4 year old toddler . i think this is for a 4 year old at most - and that most 5 - 6 year olds would be too big for it . but that said , it looks awesome . much less expensive and a much greater value than what you will find in the stores in october for halloween . 
very cute costume . my daughter loved it . only downside was the mask left a little mark on her face ( which is why i gave it 4 stars ) . however , if you don ' t use the mask then the costume itself would be a 5 . 
the costume says its size 4 - 6 , and fits children 44 - 48 " . when i received it , however , the size small package says it is 2 - 3t . it is tiny . i ordered for my soon to be 6 year old who wears a size 5t and is 44 " tall . this would never fit her the way it fits in the photo . she should be well within the range stated , but instead the costume is sized for a toddler . had to send back immediately and replace with a medium , which is for children 4 - 6t . looks to be good quality , but very unecissarily confusing ! 
my daughter really enjoyed this costume . it comes with several pieces , including a small attached cape ( can be tricky to get on ) , gloves , and rubber like belt . the belt itself is a magnet for dirt and gets dingy and grey very fast . but the material is neat - shiney and thin so it helps create the batgirl illusion . in all , we liked it . 
we just received our wonder woman costume and my daughter loves it ! it is good quality fabric , she just wore it for about four hours while playing karate and it is as good as when i got it out of the box . i would recommend it to anybody who loves superheroes . 
it was so adorable on my daughter but it was very small . in fact though it fit her just fine the skirt was way too short to look appropriate for a child . she only tried it on and never wore it again . 
the costumes are very pretty . the seller was fulfilled and fast . the fixture head a fair bit . all very well 
a great costume that allowed my daughter be wonder woman , it was using an entire week while living the adventure of the greatest heroine of the dc comics 
costume is adorable but a little big in the boots and small in the headpiece . it is very reasonably priced and arrived quickly . 
this was very stylish , very well done for a costume . however , the only negative comment i have is that the headpiece is extremely small . so small , my daughter cannot wear it . i ' ll be looking for another headpiece soon to make the outfit complete or either make one . the one in the bag won ' t do . 
my daughter loves this costume . she wears a 3t - 4t and this costume fits perfectly . as stated by the other reviewers the headband is too small and the boot covers are too big but they are not key parts of the costume for my daughter . 
i need to be a superhero this year for halloween to go with the rest of my family who will be batman and robin . i looked at a lot of wonder woman costumes and all of the ones for women are " sexy " with a low cut top and frequently a bared midriff . well , i just want to be a nice rated - g wonder woman so i thought i would try a child ' s large size because i am petite ( 5 ' 1 " ) . the costume surprisingly fits great and is very cute . my husband likes it because it looks a bit cheerleader - ish ( men ! ) . the costume is a one - piece with a belt to add . the shirt is a good length for me hitting alittle above mid - thigh but i will wear it with legging or tights . the headband , shoe covers , and wrist wraps are also cute . 
my granddaughter is really into wonder woman right now so we paired up the costume with a book and coloring book to give her a wonder woman christmas with some learning attached . she loves dress up so this outfit fits the bill . it ' s very cute and seems to be well - made . 
the medium size costume is supposed to fit a child 50 - 54 " tall . my daughter is 50 " tall and the costume is extremely short , probably more appropriate for a size small or x - small . the headband was also extremely small , it couldn ' t even fit my shitzu puppy ' s head . the belt was way too small . the boots appeared to be appropriately sized . i sewed elastic to the headband and the belt and they now fit correctly . however , the skirt on the costume cannot be altered and my daughter will need to wear shorts under it . i think someone tossed different sized parts of the costume into one package and sold it as a size medium . 
i bought this costume for my 5yr old and it fits great she is now the super hero we both love ! 
ordered 2 - one for each daughter . much better quality and material than your typical halloween costumes . runs big though - size down ! 
just got this for my daughter for halloween and she loves it . it comes with everything you see in the picture ( which makes it so much easier ) . it is easy to put on and is not to short for an 8 year girl . 
we ordered the medium for my 5 . 5 year old - it is definitely a little big , but i was glad because i thought she would be able to play in it for quite a long time and grow into it . ( she is about 44 " tall and 40lbs ) . however , after wearing it a total of 20 minutes - once to simply try it on when it arrived , and once to show off to her grandfather when he visited - it began to fall apart ! she and her sister each wanted to try on the headband and switched it between them a couple of times , literally just putting in on their heads as headbands are meant to . within minutes , the entire black outline on the headband star had flaked off completely . then , walking towards me , i suddenly noticed the hem between the skirt and bodice had a huge 8 " rip where it had separated . this is after , like i said , only about 20 minutes of wear during which time my daughter ran back and forth a few times . i couldn ' t believe it ! upon inspection , also , the stitches were all solidly intact , which means the red fabric of the top piece itself actually had ripped apart . in the past i have bought costumes for my kids at various toy stores for much less money , all of which the girls have been able to wear for years , sharing between them . this year i splurge on a more expensive costume because my daughter loves wonderwoman , and i end up with this sorry piece of junk . i would not recomend this costume to anyone ! ! i now have to keep her from wearing it ( since i have re - sewn it and redrawn the star ) until halloween so nothing else falls apart before the holiday ! the makers of this costume should be ashamed . 
the wonder woman costume was a medium for our 6 yr old grand daughter . the dress was a good fit , the leggings were way to big , but i don ' t think a small would have fit . we had to keep fixing the leggings . still it will be able to be worn again . 
wonder woman wore a leotard so i guess i shouldn ' t be terribly surprised that this skirt is super short . my daughter is 135 cm and we ordered her a medium , which should be good for someone who is 5 ' . not so , very very short . but still cute and they have a lot of fun . the headband is crazy small and doesn ' t stay on but it is a cute costume for a lot of fun . 
this product arrived on time and in great condition . we ordered a medium and it fit perfectly , she ' s 7 years old . it wasn ' t too tight or to loose . 
seemed to be better made than some other costumes we ' ve bought and it really did look adorable on her . she really liked it ! 
such a cute costume ! it seems very well made , and has held up well to my daughter running around the house in it saving the day . i love that the cape attaches on the shoulders via velcro , much better than the around - the - neck cape on my son ' s costume , which irritates his neck . this costume also came with cute accessories , including the shiny boot toppers and the gold belt . the top is also a very soft velvet - like material , with little gold bands at the sleeve . a great pick , we ' re very happy with it ! 
at first i was going to get a size small for my 5 year old cause she wears size 6 clothes but realized the size chart that it wouldn ' t probably fit her . so went with a medium ( size 8 - 10 ) and it fits just right . so make sure you look at the size chart before you get a size that you think would fit your little one ! it isn ' t sized the same way regular clothes do for kids ! i wish it was a little bit bigger for my daughter so she can fit it a long time and play dress up with it after halloween but it looks like she will grow out of it fast since it just fits her now . usually halloween costumes do end up a little bigger but not this one ! in all though the material is great and it could fit over my daughters clothes if it is cold for halloween by us . and yes i also can see the boots end up sliding down a lot but i could deal with that ! she is very happy with it and excited to wear it ! she even wants me to get the adult costume like this so we can match lol ! but we will see if i even have any money by then for it ! 
my daughter has worn this costume many times over the past year and it has held together very well . it fits her and is comfortable . 
i bought this for my daughter and it has lasted longer than any other costume she has had in a long time . she looks adorable in it ! absolutely adorable ! the boot covers are kinda cheesy and do not fit right but the rest of the outfit is perfect and looks so cute . 
i can ' t believe how high the quality is of this costume and how little you pay for it . we buy spider - man costumes for the boy , and they are terrible in comparison to this costume in terms of materials used , the time it must have taken to manufacture , etc . i highly recommend this costume for your little girl . 
i bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday and she is in love . she wears a size 5t and the outfit is a little loose but not too bad . perfect for her to grow into . the boot things are a little weird but the rest is well made . especially for the price . 
we didn ' t buy this outfit as a costume - we use it as an everyday toy and boy , does it get the use ! the imagination is just unbelievable as our little one runs around saving the world in this outfit . it ' s just soooo cute seeing them out there running around with that cape flying in the back . plus , they love swinging on a swingset in it to see the cape fly in the air just as if batman was swinging from a building . great , great fun , they wear beautifully , wash well and just are a great addition for your playchest . highly , highly , highly recommend ! 
great batman costume . great look . especially the muscle chest . unfortunately the build quality is particularly poor - i doubt it will be around for another halloween . 
my 4 year old grandson was so happy to open his package and find the costume . he loves to dess up as one of the super heroes . i make a costume box for him at christmas last year and i just keep adding to it . when his friends come over they all pick a costume . most of the costumes have come from amazon and have lasted very well through lots of little boys putting them on and taking them off . 
my boys were batman and robin for this halloween . my oldest wore this costume ( 3 . 5 years old ) . it fit him perfectly and was almost too small . the construction was very poor of this costume . loose strings and threads . i love that the mask and cape were one piece but the closure was really itchy on my son and he kept saying it " hurt " he also wore this once without a shirt on and his skin was very red like after he did . almost chemical burn like ? it healed up in a few days . it was very odd . it looked adorable but was not at all well made and i ' m still concerned about my sons skin turning red . 
this costume looks great on my 7 year old . love the cape color ( blue and black ) . my son wears everyday to play around the house with my four year old who is robin lol . so cute . 
this costume turned out great , size accurate , my son love it , and its very well made , shipped quickly and i recommend it , , 
got the toddler size for my 2 . 5 year old for halloween . it is so cute with the muscles ! he does not want to take it off . it ' s a little big , but i ' m glad he ' ll be able to play with it for a while after halloween . 
these are incredibly soft . modal is an excellent material ! they are more expensive , but very high quality ! 
i never understood spending over 20 bucks on a pair of underwear . now i do . i ' ve replaced all my underwear with these . i never went totally cheap on underwear , and they can last a very long time . . . with that in mind when it ' s time to get new ones splurging a bit doesn ' t matter . i ' m glad i did . breathable , comfortable and fresh all day . 
calvin klien is worth ever single cent . yes there not cheap but man do u get quality over and over and over . i love em so much , i have bought almost every color they have . i highly recommend you buy these . . . . . . . 
i bought these along with another brand on here to test them out . these are very soft and comfortable but i found that they were shorter than i originally thought . they are closer to briefs than boxer briefs i think . there is also no fly so just fyi for you guys . all in all i like them but not as much as i like the other pair i got on here that were rated the top on amazon for boxer briefs . 
i loved these to begin with , they fit extremely well and hold everything in place well . after a few months of use they stretched out a ridiculous amount , now they do not hold everything in place at all - they might as well be boxers . i recommend " calvin klein men ' s prostretch trunk " they are made of a thicker material that seems to be holding up much better than the " calvin klein men ' s micro modal trunk " . 
i experimented with these and really like them . the fit is good and they are very comfortable and sleek . i will order a few more . 
exactly what i was looking for . these are very comfortable and durable briefs . you can not go wrong with calvin klein clothes . 
they are thin and very soft on the skin . the low rise is very comfortable , and easy to wear all day . 
i purchased these a few years ago , at first they were the most comfortable underwear i have ever worn , but with extended use they loosen , tend to bunch up and all around feel uncomfortable . . love the fabric , i own their undershirts made of the same fabric and love them but the underwear do not pass the test of time . 
really comfortable material , not exactly the cheapest , but the fit and quality are very high , only trunk underwear i find comparable are some of the emporio armani microfiber trunks . 
it feels as if you were sitting on a cloud ! these are so lightweight and comfy ! ! i ordered both , this version , and the low rise version . overall , i like this model better . the low rise version tends to be a little tighter in my opinion . it is expensive , but it is worth it . just like what they say : " you get what you paid for . " i will definitely order more . edit : after a couple hours walking with them , these tend to ride up from the back . i am going to try to go a little smaller to see if they will hold in place , but other than that , they are really comfy ! edit again : okay , after a while , these do not hold place and start to become baggy . i do not know if the product i received is not good , but these do not hold place . i will order another to see if it is a quality issue . 
yep these are worth the money . not sure i ' m going to fill an entire drawer with them , but they are comfortable enough to get a few pair . i like the fact that they are thin and breathable . the cup doesn ' t offer quite as much support as other boxer briefs i own but this is ok because that just gives the whole assembly room to breath . 
i have several pair of these . they are very thin and very soft . the legs do tend to ride a bit but they are so thin you barely notice . they hold everything & # 34 ; in place & # 34 ; well and are nice enough for evening or day wear . 
my lady loves these ! however , they are also very comfortable and stylish . the modal material is very thin and works for those who sweat a bit more . the material also has a very good stretch to it , so you do not need to worry about any of the material getting to loose . i recommend ! 
my husband loves these boxer briefs . at first we were a little cautious because of the price , but after buying a pair and wearing them , they are completely worth the price . quality construction and materials make these boxer briefs hold up over time . 
in my quest for perfect underwear : ( thong , trunks , boxers , briefs , whatever ) these are better than good but not spectacular . the fabric is super soft and comfortable . it breaths well is perfect for those hot summer days . the picture is a little deceiving . there is something of a front pouch but it is not that well defined and does not proved nearly the support i was hoping for . the legs are pretty good and , as most trunks do , ride up a little but not too much . 
bought one blue and one black . both are comfortable and fit well and are much better than the tighty whities . you ' re woman ( or man if that ' s how you swing ) will like the style upgrade as well . 
the fabric is soft and comfortable but very stretchy . it is not as supportive as older versions i have had with other fabrics which i found better for sports . i liked the older versions and the under armor version better . 
i ' ve had a couple pair of the cotton version of these for a while . i needed some new ones and decided to try the micro modal . these are so good that i ' m replacing all of my underwear . i know , that sounds silly , but these are really that good . the micro modal breathes and wicks better than cotton . my wife has even started pilfering my dresser when she goes horseback riding . 
the material is cool to the touch and very comfortable when put on . great cut too . will purchase more for sure 
very soft and comfortable , flattering and wearable every day . i purchased one pair and then bought two more shortly after . 
one more customer , echoing same comments as previous buyers : - shocked at price , but purchased based on customer reviews - fantastic fit . not droopy or saggy - extremely comfortable , softer than cotton - looks great , not like tighty whities - four , not five stars , because durability is not proven yet 
these are a good fit . snug where you want it and room where you need it . finally calvin has given us room up front to breath . 
for those who need to insert male guards the extra room in the pouch is welcome , also the full fit and the ability to pull the stretch fabric up to the waist helps . i am borderline between l and xl . the l is snug , the way i like it . 
i loved these underwear . they are so lightweight that you feel you have nothing on . yet , they provide support and breath for a very comfortable fit and feel . definitely worth the money because they are designed extremely well . 
simply put , this offers the most amount of comfort for a pair of trunks . they offer great support / fit , and have comfort that lasts longer than any other pair of underwear that i ' ve ever owned . they fit great , aren ' t restrictive , and provide adequate support . i won ' t buy anything else . 
great for the hot days in summer . feels like you aren ' t wearing anything at all , i wish they made them in boxer style though . 
soft and silky feeling , but for the price . . . i would opt for something else . support isnt really there , but very comfy ! 
this is without question the best pair of underwear i ' ve ever worn . i will tell you why , and how i know , but there may be some uncomfortable details about how it feels to wear it ( what some might consider tmi ) . so you are warned . first of all , the underwear is incredibly soft . the modal fabric ( apparently it ' s called & # 34 ; modal ; & # 34 ; i didn ' t know there was such a thing ) feels like a nice sunglass or glasses cloth . light , smooth , soft . second , the elasticity makes the underwear conform gently to the buttocks and package . no sense of restriction , no borderline wedgie , and no tightness or difficulty adjusting . third , the fabric never stretches over time . i wore my first pair for a day and a half , including overnight ( gross , i know , but it ' s worth testing these things ) , and it remained soft , supportive , and in the right place the whole time . even the heat and sweat of my work environment ( a foundry ) could not get these things to sag . fourth , the fabric is quick drying and breathable . when you ' re hot and sweaty , there is the slightest sensation of clinging , but not anything like the oppressive stickiness of cotton . and you know how cotton briefs remain wet , heavy , and uncomfortable after you soak them ? these things dried in less than 10 minutes . fifth , these keep one ' s package nicely separate from one ' s legs . let me explain . i was a boxer guy for a long time . then styles changed ( pants became less baggy ) and i & # 34 ; filled in , & # 34 ; and between the tighter pants and my thicker legs there was less room for excess fabric in my groin area . so i switched to boxer briefs . much more comfortable , but after a few hours of wear the fabric stretched , leaving a pocket between my legs in which elements of my anatomy would stick together most uncomfortably . so i would hike the waist of the underwear and roll it down ( so it didn ' t hover around my bellybutton . it was irritating . none of that with these . finally , these are attractive . fashionably low waist sits comfortably above hips . short legs give one the comfort of briefs with the looks of a boxer brief and the synthetic fabric should hold it ' s color . i will never go back to another brief unless calvin klein stops making these . 
after my first pair , i will never wear anything else . pricey but worth it . i looove them . my girlfriend loves them . 
i normally wear boxer shorts , but decided to try the cotton version of these when i saw them on sale . i liked the fit of the underwear and when i decided to get a second pair , i opted for the micro modal trunks and i am very glad that i did . i agree with the other reviewers that these are probably the most comfortable pair of underwear that i have ever owned . the underwear fits and looks great . i travel a lot and i always wear a pair of the micro modal trunks on the long haul flights . plus the soft , light material air dries quickly which is a bonus if you have to do laundry on the road . however , i do have some gripes . the first pair of these underwear that i received started falling apart after the first wash . i used the gentle cycle and air dried the underwear , but the seams began to unravel . kudos to amazon for quickly replacing the defective pair . the other gripe that i have is that the calvin klein name which is printed on the waistband does not line up properly at the seam on the back of the underwear . instead of reading " calvin klein " it reads " calvin cal inklein " . i know that this is trivial , but when you pay so much for a single pair of underwear and for the calvin klein name , you would expect them to get the logo correct . the quality issues prevent these from getting 5 stars . in summary , simply an amazingly comfortable pair of underwear . if it wasn ' t for the price , i would own only pairs of this underwear . 
they are the softest i ' ve found and fit pretty well . carefull if you have some muscle in your butt or thighs though since the leg length is a little on the shorter side and increased butt or thigh size exacerbates the issue . i ' ve had issues with some competing brands having little to no space in the crotch despite thier advertisements ( they aren ' t even stitched to have space ) but these provide a reasonable amount of space if you like it nice and snug . 
soft to the touch , the fabric smooth and comfortable fabrics , i love it although the price a little expensive . 
they ' re a little snug ( probably shrank in the dryer ) but still great . they feel great and are very comfortable . probably one of the best boxer briefs i own . armani also makes amazing boxer briefs . 
i bought these for my now ex . he loved them . i think they are probably the best pair of undies he ' s ever had ! lol ! 
i ' m a little embarrassed to admit it , but i like buying expensive underwear . to clarify , " expensive , " to me , is anything that ' s not $ 10 fruit of the loom 3 - packs from target . i wanted to see what the fuss is about so over the years i ' ve purchased underwear from hugo boss , american eagle , emporio armani and others . the majority of my purchases have been comfortable enough or sharp looking , but none have been as comfortable as these calvin klein micro modal trunks . they feel amazing against your skin and truly , ahem , support you instead of just jamming all your bits together . i will slowly but surely replace the remaining hanes and fruit of the loom briefs with these . they feel like a dream and they ' re worth every penny . 
these are classic fake black market ck underwear . the label was really crude and they were incredibly small for a medium us size . very thin material as well . do not buy . you will be disappointed . i will never buy clothing again on amazon . plus 22 bucks for one pair ! ! ! ! zero stars ! ! ! 
these ck briefs are of very high quality , and the material of which they ' re made is very silky and soft . hopefully , they will perform as claimed for a while , but only time will tell . i bought a 3 - pack of very similar ck briefs ( just not as silky and soft ) at costco for around $ 22 . 00 . the difference in price makes me wonder if i paid way too much for these . 
while this underwear is initially great , they do ride immensely after a bit of walking around . i say " initially " because , when you put them on for the first time , they really do feel magical . i ordered a pair , and because they felt so wonderful when i put ' em on , i rushed to see if they had different colors on sale as well . indeed there were , so i got another pair . now , for $ 24 ( as of this writing ) , they should feel like you never want to take them off . when you put ' em on , they conform to your body immediately . i had a pair of cks years ago , but they gave me wedgies , so i stopped wearing them . i figured now , what with all the rave reviews on amazon , i ' d try the micro modals . maybe it ' s just the way my body ' s made , as i do have larger - than - normal hips for a guy , but i find that i adjust myself after a short walk with these on , and i shouldn ' t have to do that with $ 24 undies . i look forward to switching to my hanes , when it should be the other way around . i won ' t give them less than 3 stars because the fact is they feel great when not walking , and look great too ( around the house in private , that is ) . but they get no more stars than that because i should feel comfortable in them all the time . 
these are ok , the boxer brief version of these is much better . the legs are shorter and don ' t support as much . 
based on other reviewers i made my purchase , the fit was great but these hold in heat and by the end of the day . . . let ' s just say they were funky smelling . i still have them but only wear them to the gym still having the same results . wash and hang dry , a hot dryer will ruin the material . 
soft as cashmere , cool , breathable , gentle unbinding support ; probably the best underwear i ' ve yet to slip into ! the waist is a little high , giving that old fashioned grampy look but the uncompromising comfort trumps styling here ! 
i bought these as a gift for my husband . after the first wear , he came home from work and said , & # 34 ; i have never really thought about my underwear before , but i love these ! & # 34 ; he thought they were incredibly comfortable , didn ' t ride up , and i think they look great on him . bought a size large , he is 5 ' 8 & # 34 ; 180lbs 
i read the reviews , i bought the trunks and i was as equally impressed as most . going to buy many more . 
cotton is forgotten . . . . . love ' em ! these are very comfortable and i hope that they hold up over the long term . easily recommended as of now though . 
i love these trunks ! they fit so well and are so comfortable under jeans or dress slacks ! i would buy again in a heartbeat ! 
very comfortable with great fit . a bit expensive so value is lower but nice . very comfy feel and stretchy fit 
i have always been a fan of calvin klein underwear - - but the body line in cotton tends to lose its shape and elasticity after wear . not so with the modal fabric . it ' s soft and keeps its shape . i wish it had a bit more engineering in the pouch area for more support and enhancement like the 2xist lines . that ' s why i give it four out of five stars . 
i ' m never going to wear anything else , its good for the gym and good for date night with my wife . 
the band is a bit too narrow , but its a nice looking boxer , very fitting and stays well in shape , even after an active day 
my husband , due to a need to switch from standard boxer to a tighter fit , ordered 15 different brands of boxer brief . this item came out as # 1 for comfort , fit and quality . very soft , not too tight , keeps shape and does not bunch up or roll down during the day in a very active job . 
for a long time , i bought value packs of hanes underwear . $ 8 for a pack of 3 - why bother paying extra to get one ck brief when i can get 9 pairs of underwear for the same price ? then i got one of these as a gift and slowly started replacing all the underwear i owned with these . i prefer boxer briefs since they feel like the best of both worlds . the support and tightness of a brief , but the style of boxers . the material holds elasticity to not ride up . the material is very breathable . these are silky smooth , soft , and form fitting . it ' s like wearing lotion . the male form isn ' t the most beautiful thing to see , but these are shaped well enough to look good on guys . there isn ' t a flap in front , which may or may not bother some guys , but the way this thing is cut and the way it makes a package look it worth the trade off . guys can be vain too . it might not be victoria ' s secret sexy , but this is victor ' s secret and is about as flattering as a guy can get . i ' ve washed these over and over and they are holding up very well . the elastic bands on the cheaper underwear from hanes and other brands eventually wears out and begins to fray . i haven ' t experienced that with these boxers at all . over time , i ' m sure that these will make up for the higher cost since i haven ' t had to replace any of the ck underwear i have owned in the past few years . these are also very good for road warriors who need to pack light . they compress to almost nothing and are feather light . the micro modal material also dries very quickly , so for a road warrior / traveling businessman who is stuck for a few extra days more than expected , these can be quickly washed in a hotel sink at night and be dry a few hours later . worth it for the price ? definitely . if you are a guy ( or buying for one ) who has never bought underwear outside of value packs from walmart , try these out ; just be prepared to buy more to replace your entire underwear drawer . i don ' t think i can even go back to the value packs of underwear . they issue that stuff to convicts in prisons to punish them for their crimes . a free man on the outside deserves to have good underwear . 
best pair of underwear i ' ve ever worn . i bought two more and plan to replace all with these . thy are a bit expensive but go on sale on amazon occasionally , down to like $ 20 . worth it to me . 
not too tight , not too loose , soft , plenty of room for privates , and it keeps you drythe perfect underwear . 
i got this to match the ck micro modal crew for a christmas gift for my hubby . hubby finds it very comfortable and wears it a lot . 
after years of hunting for the perfect underwear for my husband , i ' ve finally hit the jackpot ! he absolutely loves these - " the most comfortable ever " to quote him . they are holding up really well so far . update : after several washings these have become very loose in the legs and as a result things that you want to stay in start hanging out . too bad , started off great . 
it ' s is simple when it comes to designer . they are awesomely comfortable and fit . bought 2 and now i am placing an order for 5 more . they simply are the best . 
there is no excuse to not wear fine underpants , and these are the finest i have yet found on this earth . i own several pairs . warm , cool , supportive , breathable , light . . . treat yoself . 
very soft high quality material , fit is good and the legs don ' t ride up hardly at all . only complaint is the piling after a couple of washes . 
i like these a lot . the material is oh - so - soft and the ladies love them ! i ' m 5 ' 11 , 170 lbs , and ended up going with a small . i think i still slightly prefer the steel over these though . 
i have no complaints about these . they fit well and look nice . they are on par with the jake joseph brand but a bit longer which i don ' t mind at all . they can hold up to any physical activity but they are not my go to for that . 
for the longest time i would would wear under armour shirts as undershirts . not because i was trying to suck it in , but because i liked that it was thin yet fitting and wouldn ' t bunch up under shirts . well luckily i was introduced to these since then ! these have everything i like about under armour . it is tighter , it doesn ' t bunch up , it keeps me cool or warm depending on weather , and it is long enough to tuck in . it really is great as an under shirt and fits extremely well ! ! 
these shirts fit close to the skin but are exceptionally comfortable with almost a silky feel . but , luckily there is no silky sheen . i typically wear a small t - shirt , but i ordered mediums , which fit perfectly . order a size larger than you usually wear unless you ' re looking for a compression fit . they are very long , so they stay tucked in all day . i love that they don ' t create that bulky big fig look around my waist under my dress shirts . i should also note that they are slightly sheer but look fine with a dress shirt and open collar . 
this is the second time i purhase these shirts and i ' m very satisfied with the high quality of them . totally recommended if you are a thin guy . 
this makes a good sleep shirt or something to lounge around in . it also makes a great base layer . the modal material is super soft and comfortable against the skin . 
nice if you have a real tight body . it will expose every little fat you ' ve got because the fit is way too tight . i recommend going 1 size bigger . 
bought these boots for a christmas present . they seem to run big . other than that they were nice snow boots . 
i bought these boots for my son who is working in the northern mountains of new mexico where it has been cold for a few months and snowing for a few weeks . i hope these boots will do what the ad states and keep his feet warm and dry 
boots are very high quality . . . they deserve 5 stars . . . . . this based on my own examination . . . i did not use them because the post office basically sliced the package in handling , so they arrived unusable , but to be fair . . these boots look extremely well made . the seller took care of me but i thought these boots still deserved a review . 
these boots are ok . they are comfortable but they run big . if ordering online , i would suggest ordering a half size or a whole size smaller . buyer beware . 
bought 2 pairs for my sons with winter coming they needed waterproof , warm boots . they have only worn them once but they said they are comfortable and warm . so far so good . 
hola gente : just great , for everything ! ! i used this boots to go to my job too . saludos , allan . 
the boot fits well i just had to buy soles that were fitted for me and thats all . great buy 
looks great , size is a bit larger after being in them for a bit , but all and all great shoe , came on time . and does the job it needs too 
i like the 6 & # 34 ; boot , light - weight , and durable . i use this shoe mostly for riding my motorcycle . very comfortable fit . 
just as other reviews have said , order at least a half size smaller ! they run big ! they are a bit heavy but not bad enough to not buy them . haven ' t wore them yet to see how they hold up but they look to be constructed pretty well . pretty pleased with the purchase of these boots for my son for emt school . . . 
these shoes didn ' t cost much , and there ' s reason : they ' re not worth much . i ' m not saying they ' re bad , just ok . these are the kind of leather shoes that always manage to look like vinyl ( they ' re supposed to be leather ) ; that don ' t quite ever break in properly ; that grip , but not enough ; that fit , but a bit clumsily ; that aren ' t hot , just not comfortable . and the support is just all wrong . a six inch boot is problamatic to start with , so the collar ( at the ankle ) has to be made well : these are too wide , as is the last hieght inside the shoe , from the top of the toe to the top of the toe box , to the arch ; just too roomy in all the wrong places , and my feet are dead average . i wear them , they look fine , but if i dont lace the last two lugs ( from the arch to the ankle ) outside , the collar will eat my ankles alive . in the end , i ' m afraid they look and feel cheap . 
very comfy slippers . i ' m not crazy about the looks - - they look a little " orthopedic " but being so comfy makes up for that ! 
very well made and comfortable . handy velcro so you can adjust to your width . i have washed them and they washed up great ! love these slippers ! ! ! 
i was so pleased to find these slipperson amazon in lilac and in my size ( 8 . 5 medium ) . but , before they could be shipped amazon ran out of this size . i searched all over the web , including the daniel green site and learned that the lilac has been discontinued and amazon seems to be the only site that still carries them . i ended up ordering the 9 narrow which proved too narrow . they were not available in a 9 medium so i ordered and received the 9 wide . as of today , these are no longer avalable so i ' m glad i got them in time . these are great slippers , exactly what i wanted , lilac , terry cloth & cozy & washable and good for warmer months . the size 9 wides are a bit too large when i wear them barefoot but they are adjustable which helps and with socks they are fine . i wish i could have gotten these in my size but i am glad to have gotten them at all . if you want great lilac spa style slippers go quick to amazon & see if they have your size . if you don ' t mind pink , white or blue you can get those in pretty much any size . i do recommend them highly . 
super comfy , durable and love the adjustable upper . the soles are thick and solid which is unusal for a slipper . guess that ' s why they ' re not cheap . 
these are very nice , comfortable house slippers in their manufacturing concept . i do like the slightly raised ( firm ) sole with the soft padding in the footbed and heel . these two features give much better comfort and support to the foot , arch , and heel , thus keeping a lot of unneeded pressure off the knees and back when walking and standing - - much more than other department store , flatbed or foam - cushioned , house slippers could ever offer . it is also nice to have available exact shoe sizes and the adjustable velcro top strap . if these slippers were only about these features and at a better price , they definitely would deserve 5 stars ! price , though , brings these slippers down to 4 stars . while these are better slippers than most house / lounge shoes , they do cost considerably more , and i don ' t think there is that much more comfort , style , or design that warrants the twice or triple price from other shoes available . the next star demerit is due to , since i ' m not a sock person , especially in loungewear and walking around the house and never in warm weather months , i find the 2 + inch long embroidered name tag firmly sewn into the fabric of the footbed of both slippers very annoying against bare feet . it would do daniel green much better to use a simple iconic logo in much smaller embroidery and without the irritating nylon tag . better yet , either on top or on the side of wrap - top of the slipper . these aren ' t fashion statements anyway , so if the name has to be there , why not somewhere it is not so annoying to the actual comfort of the feet these shoes are suppose to provide . socks do alleviate this annoyance , so if you ' re one that must wear , like to wear socks these shoes wouldn ' t be a problem for you in that area . these do work nice on chilly / cold nights when you want to wear thicker socks as the strap does adjust well . 
very attractive and comfortable and easily adjusted with the velcro strap . i definitely would order this brand and model again and would recommend it to any woman . 
my mother adores these slippers . they are comfy and don ' t make her feet sweat . they wash up in the washing machine and are machine - dryable as well . love them . they are always the best gift for my mom ! 
they are exactly like the picture , my husband says they are very comfortable , he wears them all the time , even around the house . lol . 
pretty good so far and it has been a couple of months since i bought this . i am a size 32 and it fits well . the reasons for 4 stars is , i am not sure of its durability , i already see some white threads / elastic fiber . hope it does not completely fall apart . 
purchased these for my son for swim team based on the reviews . yes , the fabric is nice and it fit him perfectly , but after one wearing and swim meet the hole where the tie goes has already started to rip . not a small rip but at least an inch . i am going to try and sew as he needs it on a daily basis . i am not sure if it was a defective suit to begin with , but i will tell you , when we received it the box was crushed . it may have been returned and re - sold . from now on this is something i will go to a store to purchase . 
i don ' t have any complaints about the quality of the product . i wore a lycra speedo suit prior to this one and it was definitely bigger . i ' m a 32 in the lycra speedo jammer but probably should have ordered a size up . 
after about 20 pool hours , i am delighted this pair of swim shorts isn ' t dissolving , becoming transparent , or relaxing its stitching . it ' s what i was hoping for . the fit is a bit small , but you want a skin tight suit , right ? 
this swim suit fits as expected and the string at the top is very sturdy . the color is a shade or 2 darker than the pic on the site but that is good thing for me . i have never owned this fitted style of suit before but i love it . i can not wait to swim in it on my vacation . it arrived on time , was packed well and is good quality . my gfs like it so much they want me to order the other 2 colors as well . 
i have 10 watches that i love to wear with different outfits . i have been paying $ 5 and $ 6 to get the battery changed . this kit is saving me money hand over fist . it is so easy to open the back of the watch and replace a dead battery . what a great idea ! all the items in the kit are useful including the brush , the tweezers , the back opener and small screw drivers ( one phillips and one flat head ) and the knife . it is very sharp so be careful . i highly recommend this watch battery replacement kit for anyone who wants to save money on their watches . 
this was a great item . it does everything that i expected . i can now change the batteries in my collection of watches 
i have been getting charged for changing batteries , changing links quite excessively as of late and i figured , why not do it myself . of course , as a beginner , i wasn ' t sure which tools to buy ( even after reading conflicting reviews ) , so i purchased the 16 - piece se set , the se watch case tool with adapters and this 10 piece set . unlike the others which are made in china , this one is made in india . i . toolsthe tools in this battery replacement set are : - two mini - screwdrivers - watch case opener ( horizontal and not the usually two - three tip tool with adapter ) - seiko case remover - plastic tweezer - non - magnetic tweezer - dust brush - knifeii . removing watch case backand this is probably the tool that i actually have had more success in removing case - backs with a hole on the caseback and that is using the watch tool remover that came with this set . it was easy to use and it ' s funny that a few jewelers were unable to open the case with their watch case opener ( the blue object in picture ) , so i was glad to see that this thing came in handy . i used the screwdrivers from this set the most than what i have in my 16 - piece as it looks more sturdy . i liked how it came with the brush , because if you are opening older watches , you ' ll notice crumbs or dirt that could have gotten inside and so the brush comes in handy . the knife looked like i can cut myself easy with it , so i preferred to use the knife case opener for older vintage watches to remove the case back . these casebacks have no holes or divots but by putting your knife to an angle near the lugs , these type of cases then remove easily with the knife . i also look at the seiko opener and plastic and non - magnetic tweezers as great tool additions to this set . iii . pricefor those who want to change batteries , it ' s a pretty great deal for under $ 10 . iv . overallthere were tools that came in handy and were very useful for several watches that my 16 - piece set was unable to open . i do recommend this set as an addition to the 16 - piece set but if you are looking to remove case - backs , the blue object on its own is $ 4 so , it ' s worth owning as i found it easier to remove the case for some watches . the brush is also a nifty addition and literally , you ' re getting quite a bit for this cheap set . now knowing what i do know after buy three se products , if you are going to be changing batteries on quartz watches and also removing casebacks and links , i recommend the 16 - piece se set . but because this 10 - piece comes with items with each selling for $ 3 . 99 - $ 4 . 99 each , it ' s a worth addition to your 16 - piece watch fixing set as it has beneficial tools such as the sturdier mini - screwdrivers the brush and most importantly the case removing tools . it ' s also not a bad idea just in case you have problems or you lose a tool , you can look to these extra tools as a backup to your pre - existing tool set . but if you need to purchase one , this one is great for removing case - backs and for changing batteries . it ' s very affordable . . . but once again , you may find the se 16 - piece more suitable for you . especially if you want to start removing your own links . and for batteries , it may not remove all cases and even the 16 - bit set may be ineffective for challenging watches , so a se watch case tool with several adapters may be what you need . but once again , for the price of this 10 - piece set and how much the items inside it cost quite a bit if sold piece - by - piece . it ' s a steal ! definitely recommended ! 
i use this watch battery replacement kit all the time . it has saved me quite of bit of money not having to take my watch to a store to have the battery replaced . 
i would rather replace batteries than buy new watches . i had been using small screwdrivers to remove the backs of watches . sometimes , i attempted to remove the backs with steak knives . i couldn ' t always get the backs off . when i recieved this kit , i removed the backs from three watches that i thought i would have to take to a jeweler . i think that the kit has paid for itself ! the reason that i can ' t give this 5 stars is that there were no instructions . i had ordered a watch repair guide that explained how to get the backs off using this equipment and / or other tools that i could have ordered from amazon . 
i am very pleased with this battery replacement kit that i have used especially since it really works well and was a great buy . 
if i could give zero stars i would . i have ordered cheap watch products made in china for the last time . these tools were so bad , and cheaply made , there was no way i would even attempt to use . there were rough edges on every piece and fit and finish was none existent . i don ' t recommend , spend more for higher quality . 
if you watch the u - tube tutorial by jewelrysupply . com , she covers the use and correct application of " most " of the tools in this kit . i actually went in and did a cost analysis of these same tools at different web sites , and this little toolkit is worth the investment . i am an avid watch collector - - from expensive to " cheap " and fun watches . icould spend a small fortune to keep my little watch wardrobe keeping good time - - thus , the purchase ofthis kit . the only thing the kit does not have is a piece of leather ! ! ! another post here gives excellentadvice on keeping it safe . these tools will damage your thumb on the opposite hand that is holding the watchback ; if you slip off and gouge the tool into that finger ( thumb ) holding the watch case . be vigilant ! wear a leather glove on the hand holding the watch back or , as in the video on u - tube , use a piece of leatherto hold the watch back and protect that hand holding the watch back - - all it takes is a slip , and you ' re runningto the emergency room for a wound that you could have avoided . this kit is worth the price . 
this cap sits quite high on my head . i am accustomed to low - profile as more ' baseball cap ' type , versus trucker style . in this case the cap looks more like the kind beaver cleaver wore ; or , like on the kid in the godzilla movies . ( maybe that ' s what is meant by " vintage . " ) the fabric itself doesn ' t appear time - worn ; more like the twill of a texaco shirt when new . it ' s tough to be too critical of an $ 8 hat . otherwise , the three - star rating would be lower . 
i love the style . and the fit is on the money . i am glad that i made this purchase . the curved bill is the way to go . 
this is basically a economical hat that is of good value . the reviewers who say that this is small are partially correct , the circumference is perfectly adjustable , but the actual volume of the cap ' s dome is a bit shallow , meaning if you have an elongated cranium , the cap may sit on the tipy top of your head , however , you would probably need a really large noggin to notice . the color will be lighter than the picture ( i have the brown / stone ) and the brown is much lighter than picture on here . the hat is not structured , as clearly stated in the description , so it is floppy and won ' t look rigid like the pictures . overall , the quality , texture and price are great and the shipping was really fast . 
this is my third one and it ' s very classy that you can wear with just about anything . this is an all time winner . 
i realize this is an adjustable hat , but it ' s pretty small and would suit a younger kid well . for adults its ok if you ' re a pinhead . oh well . its cheap . 
i purchased this hat in the burnt orange color which is really nice ( not at all like the hunter orange i was afraid it would be ) . the quality is good and i would definitely purchase another . 
its a good cap while it lasted but its worth it since it only lasted for 2 years and it shrunk . 
summer time and i was looking for a hat for my 9 yrs boy . the stone color was available at a good price and the delivery was quick as always . 
it ' s a great looking cap , only negative as of now is that the upper material is a bit thin , but i ' ll accept it since it was so reasonably priced . btw i was looking for something unmarked , without being a walking billboard for for some name brand . 
i purchased two . they fit great on my size big head and they look great as well . it ' s nice cause i don ' t feel like a walking advertisment . 
very nice cap , good quality and design for this price . very resistant and good fit . very recommended for this price 
this hat is super comfy . great price , durable , and handy . i play lots of sports outside in the sun and because of that a hat is very necessary . this hat works great , keeps the sun and sweat out of my eyes . only bad thing i can say is that it now has sweat stains all over it but as much as i use it that ' s to be excepted . this hat is worth every penny . i love it and you will too . 
buy this shoe ! ! ! i don ' t think there was anything other than a fitting to know this shoe wasn ' t going to fit my feet . i want this shoe so much but it is not fashioned for ugly fat feet such as mine ; size 10 wide . too bad for i would purchase at least 2 pair . had to return : ( 
these were a gift for my daughter and she loves them ! they are high but very easy to walk in . we both have them in several colors . 
don ' t get me wrong i love the shoe - i purchased the taupe - for some reason the right shoe fits comfortable the left sits slightly lower over my big toe and its actually the stitching that gives me grief - but hey , i purchase shoes based on price and look - the material is quite stiff and not being leather i ' m unsure if things will get better with wearing - i think the 1st few wears will have to be for sit down events - i ' m normally 8 . 5 in mia shoes but this particular shoe to me feels a little narrow compared to other mia styles . the ball of the shoe tends to be a little behind your natural ball perhaps too far back giving a sense of instability - i constantly feel like i ' m going to topple forward so if you ' re not a veteran of high heels i ' m thinking this might not be the best shoe to start stepping out in - based on my last sentance these are not for use with alcohol , sloping surfaces , lengthy walks , or dancing . . . . just sit or stand and look pretty ! ! 
i am so happy that i will never have to walk in these because they are impossibly tall and ridiculously stiff . wow . 
nice shoes very cute and sexy , just the size order was a little to big ( order a size 8 and needed a size 7 . 5 ) . 
considering i didn ' t pay much for these , i wasn ' t expecting much . arrived a day early , but when i tried them on i noticed how stretched out they were when i took them off . i don ' t have incredibly meaty legs or ridiculously long legs , but they stretched out far more than i had expected them to . i ' ve paid about the same for better tights - they ' ll do , but i don ' t think i would buy them again . you get what you pay for . i must admit that , being a ginger , i have a hard time getting tights that are close to my skin tone , but these were almost spot on . for those of us who don ' t tan often , the color is just right . 
i found these to be very soft and complimentary . they do stretch considerably and should be treated with some care . that being said , for this price how can you beat them ? i like the different colors they offer as well . 
i got the plus sized light blue stockings . they are a very pretty color in person and they are truly plus sized . at first i was worried i couldn ' t wear them because they looked so small , but they stretch pretty good ( keep in mind i have thick thighs ) , and they don ' t stay stretched out when you take them off . they do a little bit , but they go back to their original size . 
too small and won ' t stay up . nothing more to say , but i have to write twenty or more wrods to publish this . 
i really like these thy r really soft only problem is u have to be very careful with them the run so easily . but the color and feel r great i love them my favorite is the pick and blue but this is ok just don ' t get plus i did not mean to but my friend loves them and thy r ok for me just silly me i got the wrong size lol . ^ _ ^ 
i bought this as a toe right and its awesome . ive always hated toe rings , thought id give it another go , and this one is great . i cant even tell its there . ive showered and slept w / it on and have had no issues 
this is an okay silver ring . it had a scratch on the side and inside , so i had to exchange it , but then after i received the exchanged ring , it was a little looser on my finger than the original ring . oh well ! the seller was very prompt with service , though , so i do recommend the purchase . 
i love this ring . the only thing i really have a problem with it is i rubbed it up against a wooden post and scuffed it like it was made out of butter . 
i ordered two of these , they are small and dainty and look great as a thumb ring . i ordered another for my best friend because she liked mine . if you like small and simple , they would look good on any finger ! delivery was quick and products arrived in great shape . i would definitely recommend ! 
just lovely - - simple , elegant , perfect fit , easy to slip on and off , thin enough not to be too overwhelming , but the perfect width for my thumb ring . 
i love this little thin band . i wear it on my thumb and it is thin enough that it doesn ' t bother me while i am working . silver is my favorite colour when it comes to jewlery and this little ring shines and silver is so easy to take care of . i love it ! sterling silver 2 mm 1 / 16 in . thin wedding band / toe ring / thumb ring size 8 
this is a very nice ring for the money . it does bend and get dents easily thou . has a very nice polish and comfortable . i got this ring to wear after i had a baby to replace my wedding ring set . i ordered a half size bigger and the ring fits great . i think for the money , its wonderful for a great stand in ring or starter band . 
not crazy about the lack of luster , but what can you say ? it ' s great for stacking , straight forward , cool for a wedding band if that ' s what you want it for . might definitely want to dip it in something to make the shine return because it will go away . for sure . 
i love this ring . i wear it on my right pointer finger and it is so shiny and light i forget i ' m wearing it . i might have to get another one for my left thumb . 
i bought myself two liked them so much i bought 6 more for my grandsons they love them no tarnishing o wear mine all the time and no problems with them at all they deserve a 10 star . 
it has a nice shine but i had some other sterling silver rings before and i don ' t expect it to stay as shiny . the thickness ( or thinness ) is great for me for when i play guitar . not as fancy as some other rings but it ' s simple and does the job . 
i ordered two of these rings in a size seven to wear on my thumbs . they arrived bright and shining and after near daily wear they are still gorgeous . for an inexpensive alternative to white gold or platinum , these are certainly the way to go . my only recommendation would be to check your ring sizing elsewhere ( unless you already know it ) . amazon ' s ring sizing guide is off and if you order these ( which are true to size for me ) based on amazon ' s measurements , you will likely be disappointed . 
great ring ! has a charming glow to it . realy comfortable ! i wear it on my thumb , people compliment me all the time ! 
this is way more better than what i expected , i will make sure that i will keep the senders information to make other orders , 
i wanted to use this ring as a thumb ring since i broke the last one i had . i love it . . it looks good . . im very happy i got it . . fits good . . and hasnt broke or ya know turned color lol . . all good from me . . 
i actually ordered this for my thumb and it fit perfectly ! it is made very nicely and no sharp edges ! i get compliments on this regularly . i wear other rings on my other fingers to compliment it ! it works ! it is already polished so no need to polish ! very nice ! packaging is nice and arrived quickly too ! thank you so much ! 
when i saw this i knew my mom would love it . it ' s totally unique . i was worried because some of the reviews make it sound like garbage . this is not my impression at all . the item has a good weight to it . my only complaint is because it ' s top heavy it tilts forward . when it arrived we had to take the chain off to get the stones in . so i don ' t see how the stones can " fall out " because the chain keeps the locket closed . it appears to me the locket is designed to hold 3 - 6 stones . after i helped her put the stones in ( which took a delicate touch ) she put it on and has been wearing it since . no problems . she just loves it . it ' s elegant but casual enough for everyday . 
i love this ! i just ordered 2 and it is beautiful and did not fall apart its just right in the size and the stones are darling ! i would recommend it highly . . i think the price was worth it because in a jewelry store it would be a lot more . i love jewelry and this is definitely a great find . just beautful ! 
my wife loved this pendant and being able to add or remove stones makes it very personal and unique to each mother and her children . 
my daughter gave me this , and so i ' d never tell her ( but she does frequently comment that she cannot see the stones ) . 1 . you cannot see the stones inside when you ' re wearing it . . . . . i guess you just have to enjoy knowing that they ' re there . . . 2 . the clasp is very tiny and cheap . 3 . the loop that the chain passes through is . . in a very odd place . on the back side of the pendant , so it ' s just oddly lumpy and hangs awkwardly . . . i don ' t quite understand why it was designed this way . not something i enjoy wearing , except that my dear daughter got it for me . . i can fix that clasp problem . and i guess a jewelry could redesign the loop a bit , for me . but . . you still couldnt see the stones . . . a lot of fixing to do here , such a shame . 
my mom loved her necklace . i would recommend this necklace as a gift for any occasion for that special woman in your life . 
it ' s very beautiful and arrived very quick , the packaging was very nice . but , i don ' t know if it ' s a one time defect or if it ' s the workmanship . on the front right side of the heart , it has an opening all the way through . it doesn ' t look like it ' s broken , just seems like it wasn ' t welded together as it should ' ve been . it doesn ' t affect how it works ( open or closing ) , just irritates me . gives a perfect heart a flaw . forgot to mention , i bought it as a gift to give my mother . i gave it two stars because it ' s still pretty nonetheless , but it ' s not worth that price . the most i believe it ' s worth is $ 25 . 
my 11yo dil hated this . why ? i think packaging . when you package something cheap then it feels cheap . the actual product isn ' t bad , just poorly presented . 
not the best made necklace . the stones that go inside look pretty cheap , but you can hardly see them so it doesn ' t matter . 
cute locket but certainly not a piece of fine jewelry . it comes with the entire set of birthstones but you can only fit a few in . three stones fit easily , five will not fit at all and four is a squeeze . 
in the proper size , this bra lifts the breasts off the ribcage , giving a more youthful silhouette , and makes you more shapely by bringing them a little more toward center , making one look thinner . so , up and center . this bra provides plenty of support with a natural look , no padding in the cup area , but does have some special stitching on the armpit side of the cup for support . it ' s hard to see in the photos but works well . the shoulder straps have some padding , making them a little wider and more comfortable . fabric is soft and comfy . you ' ll feel prettier and thinner . i got a professional bra fitting and bought a couple of these at the lingerie outlet store , and am now buying other colors on amazon . btw , amazon ' s price is $ 2 cheaper than the outlet store ( and that doesn ' t take in to consideration the cost of gas to drive thirty miles one way to get there . the bra consultant said that most women have to go down one size in inches and up one cup size . that ' s exactly what happened . i thought a larger cup size would make me look bigger , in fact , i look smaller busted , more shapely , and trimmer . all in all , a great investment , and my most favorite bra ever . 
i love this bra ! i ' ve bought it a few times over the years and size has remained consistent . great for larger busted ladies . comfortable and supportive . 
the bali bras always fit me nicely . it fits so comfortably that i can barely tell i have it on . the only criticism is that there is no padding in the cups , and when you ' re slightly overweight and over the age of 50 , and you have a t - shirt or smooth knit top on . . . . . just fill in the rest . i detest that look on anybody , but the bra is lovely and the fit is perfect for me . 
the fit is great , it is confortable and offers good support but the cup fabric is too thin . if it had lining i would have loved this bra but it does not so i am going to return this one . 
i chose this for the color , style and price . all met my expectations . it is very comfortable and does the job it is supposed to do . 
i have ordered a few so obviously they work for me . they give you great fit and comfort . i would definaetly recommend . 
fit poorly and made me feel like madonna in her cone bra ! sent this one back ! 
i had bali bras before and thought this one will offer same support and comfort like few others . it offers good support , minimizes at least 1 & # 34 ; , but it ' s not very comfortable and the sizing is not very accurate . i ' ll continue to try and , hopefully , i ' ll find a good 36d bra for myself . 
bras are the hardes garmet for me to find a perfect fit . the straps are comfy , the cups have great support without being restrictive and give coverage without being stiff . 
this bra is very comfortable and it fits perfect ! sometimes when ordering a bra , the sizing can be off , not this bra it is exactly the size in the cup and around , so no guessing ! 
i like bali bras as they seem to fit me the best . i ' ve been trying different ones as my new favorite had been discontinued by bali . this is comfortable , has wider straps so doesn ' t dig in . i ' m a ddd , so comfort and support is what i ' m looking for in a bra . concealing is also a plus with the soft taupe color . 
the bra did not fit the description . no lift or good support . also the bra is so thin that you can totally when your nipping . i don ' t recommend this bra . 
and i have been wearing these for quite some time . whenever it ' s time to replace a bra , the bali live it up seamless underwire bra is the first and only one i choose . i know how they fit , i know how they look , and it is the best fit of any bra i have ever had . 
after reading that the bali women ' s live it up bra is the best design for those of us who are no longer ` perky ' i immediately ordered one in the same size i used to wear in bali . i am round - busted , full in the middle as well as the sides , and clearly the new bra isn ' t designed for my shape . it squeezes me to the middle and over the top , creating a too - small - cup - bulge . i highly recommend this bra for any woman who wants a little more cleavage , but it isn ' t for those of us who are already quite full in the middle . the bra is very well made , the straps are comfortable , the lift it provides is great , and the push to the center creates a surprising amount of additional cleavage without the use of padding . i gave this bra to my daughter who loves it and would award it 5 stars . she has asked me to order two more for her . if you would like a little extra cleavage , then this would be a 5 - star bra for you ! amendment 8 / 28 / 2012 : ordered this bra for myself in 38ddd which is one cup - size larger than my previous order and now i see why it continues to be my daughter ' s favorite bra style . the larger cup size eliminated my uni - boob problem mentioned above . the lift is surprisingly good , yet comfortable . the straps ' wide " comfort " portion extends completely over the shoulder which makes it so much more comfortable for us heavy breasted women . in most other bras , i have found the comfort part of the strap is too short . i highly recommend this bra with the caveat that , if you are packed into your current cup size , or if you are very round busted , order this bra one cup size larger . my daughter knew from the get - go that this is a 5 - star bra , now i know it , too ! 
it gives fabulous support and has great shoulder straps . the fabric is silky and the cup gives a nice profile . 
being a 42ddd , it ' s very hard for me to find bras . so when this came in , i really wanted to like it . unfortunately , there are some flaws that keep me from loving this bra . first of all , the straps are not fully adjustable , which i knew when ordering , but the straps are actually very big and slide around a lot . secondly , the & # 34 ; petals & # 34 ; on the bottom / side of the bra are aggravating ! i ' m constantly itchy where they lie on my skin . and lastly , this bra is thin ! i know a lot of bras in larger sizes don ' t use any padding , but even when i wear this under a thick cami and t - shirt , it ' s slightly see through . the cups and band fit true to size , and well enough that i will be keeping the bra , but it ' s not my go to . 
fit is ok and the price is right , its just a little itchy but i am hoping that will go away with the wash . 
this bra is very comfortable and sexy . it is well shaped and the straps can be adjusted to suit anyone 
i have big boobs . there , i said it . i have such big boobs , in fact , that the largest cup size ( ddd ) of this particular model is just a teensy bit too small to hold in my particular sweater puppies . but i buy them anyway because bali got it right with this one ; in fact i ' ve gone through several because they ' re the only bras i wear . the under - wires , though they will eventually break ( it ' s inevitable if you are blessed with enormous melons ) , are comfortable , which is hard to be if you ' re an underwire . the cups themselves are soft and cozy , and there are no seams - no bullet bras here ! the straps are padded where they should be , as opposed to way too far in front like some of the more " just add more fabric to the cup " types of extra - endowed bras out there . . . those folks don ' t realize that the massive mammaries drag the bra * forward * . . . which means if you leave the straps the same as for the b - cuppers , those half - conceived padded bits will be somewhere on the front of the shoulder , doing nobody any good at all . lastly , you should know this is not a minimizer . at all . and why should it be ? ! be proud of your assets ! don ' t strap em ' in like they did something wrong ! let them be round and bouncy and pleasant for all to behold , including you . grab one of these accurately - sized bras ( measure yourself first , check online for the way to do it properly ) and a v - neck t - shirt , and let em ' be happy hooters . the only thing i wish for this bra would be a few more cup sizes , and more color . . . if i could , i ' d buy this bra in every color of the rainbow . i ' d buy two of each , in fact , and some for friends as well . 
yes , it is itchy . i have tried 5 different bali bras and they are all itchy ! like really itchy , immediately itchy . only bali . what is that about ? anyway . . . the cups were a little small . on the top and bottom . a little quadraboob going on there . the bottom of the cups have no support , although the sides have a little . did someone forget how gravity works ? perhaps it is made for another shape , but it didn ' t work for me . 
i always wear bali bras . but this one is terrible ! the underwire painfully poked me in the underarm area , the entire bra felt abrasive on my skin ( very itchy ) , and the cups are very sheer ( no & # 34 ; highbeam & # 34 ; coverage ) . 
have purchased this bra in stores for years but got a better price through amazon . as a well endowed woman , i love this bra because it really does hold it all together . lifts ' em up and keeps them there . 
i love this bra . i wear a ddd bra and anyone who wears this size knows that most bras this size are not pretty . well this one is . it is also very comfortable with great support . i would recommend this to anyone . you ' ll be pleaantly surprised . 
while not a big fan of underwires in general , i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this bra is . i was looking for a seamless , soft - cup bra - - not pre - formed , foam cups like so many out there today . this one fits my needs and is very pretty too . the straps are wide enough to be comfortable , there are 3 sets of clasps in the back , the underwire is covered with soft fabric and helps shape and define - - all good ! one thing that might be helpful to other interested shoppers is that my regular size is 40b but 40c fits in this bra . i guess that may mean that the cup size runs a bit small . anyway , i liked it so much that i now own three and will probably buy a fourth . 
this is a fantastic bra for the price . it is comfortable , supportive , provides lift , and the cups are nicely lined . the only reason i am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cups seemed to run a bit large . i am 5 ' 2 " and 140lbs and am pretty consistently a 34dd . the dd cups were too big and wrinkled when i tried the bra on , so i exchanged the bra for a 34d and i am extremely happy . you may just want to order 1 cup size smaller than usual 
does the trick and will last a long time , like bali usually does . . . will buy another . bali quality for affordable price 
this bra was super comfortable , but that was about it . under a tee shirt it showed parts of my body i buy a bra to keep covered . the cups are not molded , and it looked suspiciously like something you ' d find in grandmas laundry basket . so it didn ' t make it past the try on stage before i stuffed it back into the shipping envelope and sent it back . 
this bra has a lovely soft cup with a little extra support on the outer side to help with the lift . the fit was perfect for me ( 34d ) . i can wear just about anything bali makes in my size , that is why i stay with this brand . 
some reviews of this bra say it does not have enough support . i am a 44ddd , and i have no complaint . rather , i say this bra gives plenty of support and is very comfortable . also , it does not have the wires pushing up in the middle , as some other underwires do . wonderful , supportive , and comfortable . 
this bra is fine and does fit comfortably . i needed a new black bra so it did the trick . thanks . 
as soon as i got this out of the package i loved the fabric , solo soft . it fit nicely . and felt comfortable to wear . have not tried wearing it for lomg hours yet , but it feels like it isgoingto be comfy . 
i have always bought the playtex 18 hour bras because i believed in the advertising that said they were comfortable . unfortunately i was never satisfied . it was pure happenstance that i was in a store that sold this bra and i bought it because the aisle was clogged going to the playtex bras . i tried the bra on when i got home and was ecstatic with how comfortable it was . i am very top heavy and most bras dig into my shoulders and the underwires are just plain uncomfortable . i wore it for the entire next day with absolutely no discomfort in the straps or the underwires . in fact , this bra is so soft that it almost feels like a second skin . i decided right then that i needed more of these bali bras and bought 2 more from amazon . if you are the type of the person who cannot wait to get out of their bra at the end of the day , i encourage you to try this bra . i believe you will be pleasantly surprised with the fit and feel of the fabric . i will never buy a playtex bra again . 
im a size 38dd and thats the problem to find a bra that supports me but doesnt make me feel like im carrying a neck brace , bali always does the job cleanly and comfortably , no extra lace that shows up under my shirts and the material is soft and wears well all day im very happy with this bra and amazons price is fantastic 
i love these . no stress on shoulders yet great support . this is the second time around i ' ve chosen these , stock up . 
this did not look good or feel very supportive for my large bust . i ended up returning it , even though i do like some bali bras . 
it is a lovely bra . i am happy that there are several colors to chose from . will definitely purchase another one soon . 
i took a chance and ordered my first bra online and i ' m glad i did . this bra fits better than most bras i can find these days . i ' ve reordered twice . very comfortable . 
i like this bra . the only issue i have had with both that i own is that after a few wearings there is a scratchy spot right between the breasts at the bottom of the band . i think it ' s the way it had to be sewn to get the slight ' curve ' look . other than that it ' s fine . 
reading reviews i bought this bra for the lift and support . i am wondering where the lift and support is ? the bra is rather flimsy , underwire is not strong , and the side lifts do nothing to lift and support . i am a bali fan , but this bra is a waste of money for large busted women ( 36c , size 6 petite ) looking for a good lift . the straps are wide , so if you are one who doesn ' t like showing bra straps with tanks , tees , this bra ' s straps can ' t be hidden . amazing that photo shows a lift , but on me the bra buckles and stiples at the cup tops . will not be wearing this one out of the house . comfort ? well , because it is so flimsy , i guess you could say it is comfortable . my sugggestion is if you are small busted it may work for you . 
i am 25 and quite amply - busted ( 38 ddd ) , and it seems that my choices are cheap udder holders or $ 70 cacique bras in ugly floral prints . i had one bali bra that i have stretched out , but i use to sleep in , so decided to give this one a go . i couldn ' t have asked for a better fitting or better - looking bra for the price . it offers the support i need without pinching or digging in , and the elastic in the straps is minimal so i don ' t experience sagginess . though there is some thickness on the shoulder straps , they are not wide enough to peek out of my sleeveless work shirts . plus . . . these bras are pretty . they ' re simple and soft , but attractive enough that i feel kinda sexy wearing them ! they perk the girls up but take the strain off of my back . yes ! 
this bra that i purchased from amazon fits great . thinking this is a great bra . . . let ' s go to a local store and buy a 2nd was an eye - opener . they didn ' t seem to be the same bra in that they fit so wildly differently . i am happy , however , with this amazon bra - - extremely happy because it actually fits ! it doesn ' t seem scratchy to me at all , and it looks nice . i can ' t say how durable it is , but it laundered well and needs to be line dried , which is easy enough . i got this bra in a 38dd , but wear a 38ddd in olga and in wacoal , and both bands there are a little too snug . the bali is very comfortable , and i can wear it on the last setting comfortably , giving the bra a potentially long ' life ' since i can tighten it as it relaxes . really good bra . 
i have tried other brands and i find bali fits me the best . it feels the most comfortable and give me the best support . i highly recommend this bra . also the price was so much better then i found anywhere else . 
when i was younger , i lamented i was too flat chested . now that i ' m over 50 , the opposite is true . age , gravity and weight have made my upper section look like one big blob . i used to have a thin waist ; now it appears non existent ! i decided i needed a lifting bra to separate my bust from my waist again . the ones i ' ve tried , however , made me look like nurse diesel from the movie high anxiety : pointing straight out as opposed to perking me up ! so i realized i not only needed lift but some minimizing as well . being a 40c , i didn ' t want a lot of minimizing though . due to amazon ' s liberal return policy on clothing , i decided to try four different minimizing , lifting bras . the bali live it up bra ( this one ) had no lining which was its major drawback . the cups were also a little too loose at the top so the look was not as smooth due to that . it lifted and minimized well without making me look flat chested . i liked the wide comfort straps but not the three hook band . it might have worked in a smaller cup size if it had some light padding . the olga luxury lift minimizer had no lining , which allowed for too much show through . the cups fit well , but it had a wide three hook band and felt a bit tight . it was one of the best minimizers of the bras i tested - - if that ' s your main goal . in my case , it made me look too flat chested . the bali passion for comfort bra ( 3385 ) also had no lining , allowing for too much show through . like the other bali , the cups were a bit loose at the top making it look wrinkly . it felt tighter and less comfortable than the bali 3353 . also , it minimized a bit too much and made me look flat chested . the vanity fair age defying lift bra was the best of the lot . it was the only one of the four that had some light padding . i didn ' t want any show through if i wore a t - shirt so some type of lining was essential . the straps are comfortable and the band only has two eye hooks which i prefer as opposed to the wide bands with three . the lift gives me more of a youthful silhouette and the minimizing feature makes me look trimmer without appearing flat chested . i can actually see my waist again ! it is also a very smooth look - - perfect for t - shirts . 
these are my & # 34 ; go - to & # 34 ; bras and the only ones that i ' ve found that fit me just right . the quality of the fabric and the construction has remained a constant in the many years that i have been buying and wearing out this particular style since i first found them at a kohl ' s store . buying them through amazon has saved me tons of money and headaches as i ' m rarely in places where i can just go shopping . the only problem i ever have with these bras is that the plastic underwires eventually just break . this can take 6 months or 2 years and it doesn ' t seem to matter how i treat them . i don ' t find this a huge problem as this just gives me a chance to try out some new colors every now and then . i love the wide shoulders straps and the four hook back on the ddd size . so comfortable ! 
i purchased this bra for my sister in law . not only was the fit fabulous , but so was the quality and price . 
it ' s a bit smaller than i expected . if you ' re between sizes , order up . it is comfortable , and the padded staps are nice . 
i wear size 34d and this bra fits me well . the material is soft and silky . the straps are adjustable and on the shoulder area there is a soft padding so that the straps don ' t dig into your skin . the cups are not padded but there is a lot of support . overall this bra is a basic yet comfortable one and for the price , you can ' t go wrong . 
i have this watch in sort of a mid - green color , and i ' ve beat it to death . runs like a top , does everything i need . plus , i ' m a scuba diver and have had it at depths of up to 110 feet fairly often without problems . it really is water resistant . true , the watchband dies pretty quickly , but i found several places to buy a replacement for an average price of $ 12 . . . one is a sports outlet with three initials in the name - the 18th letter of the alphabet , the 5th , and the ninth . i ' ve had mine for over a year and the battery ' s still going , but admittedly you probably do have to take it to a jeweler to have it replaced . good luck ! 
i ' ve been wearing timex ironman watches for over 10 years . it ' s true that the fabric or velcro bands get stinky ( usually permanent old - sponge odor ) , and i ' m not even a sweaty or stinky person . so , i get the resin ( soft plastic ) , which is stink - resistant and washable . true , the resin band does have a tiny resin ring through which the remaining band is threaded - and this breaks off in maybe a year or two ; but you can just cut off the remainder of the band off ( the part with the spaced holes ) , and still wear it just fine if you ' re not easily embarrassed or very finicky ( no one notices , as fas as i know ) . that ' s what i ' ve been doing with my current two pairs for the past three years ( one is mine , one was salvaged from a male friend ) . ( fyi : i just saw a $ 12 replacement band for ironman sold on amazon . ) the batteries have lasted over four years . what i love most is the indigo light to see what time it is in the dark , especially before the crack of dawn . ironman is very durable and dependable , too ; scratches have never been an issue . i own many movado ' s and skagens , a seiko and a swatch . . . but the ironman is far and away my go - to no - worry watch . i feel lost and get upset when i can ' t find mine . . . good thing i own two ! ! i ' m 5 ' 3 " with a 5 - 7 / 8 " wrist ( small ) wrist , and this fits perfectly - at the perfect wrist location - using the smallest band setting . this watch looks fine on average - size males i ' ve seen , but - if you ' re a big - type guy - you probably want a big - ger watch . this measures about 1 - 3 / 8 " at it ' s largest diameter . ok , i love this watch . . . thought i should give it my endorsement . hope that doesn ' t make the price go up and the inventory go kaput : / 
i ' ve worn timex ironman watches for the past 13 years . they are very decent watches for a relatively inexpensive price . i prefer the resin strap watches because they don ' t retain odors like the cloth straps do . i can take or leave the flix technology , it activated itself sometimes when i didn ' t want to , and wouldn ' t work when i did . i just relied on using the normal indiglo button . these watches typically last me about a year and a half , and it is always the same piece that gives out . the small retaining band for the strap breaks inexplicably in the middle of the night , and i end up with the excess end of the strap flapping and catching on my clothes and falling off . the new watch straps are about half the price of what a brand new watch costs , and i find i prefer just to pick out a new watch because after the year the paint on the face has started to chip and it looks ragged . it ' s also a refreshing change of pace to get a new color . 
please note : the watch is fantastic . it ' s the description of the size that is the problem . as i now see another reviewer mentioned , the watch should be advertised as women ' s not unisex . i have subsequently purchased the men ' s version of this watch , the timex men ' s t5e901 . i absolutely love the watch . the functionality is the same as the & # 34 ; unisex & # 34 ; ( women ' s ) , but the strap and face on the 901 are larger . this is the perfect workout watch , especially if you swim as well . it ' s low profile but very functional . ladies , this 961 is the right size for you . gents , i ' d suggest considering the 901 . 
as an aquatic director my arm is wet every day . this watch is small , light , visible , loud , and won ' t get soggy ! perfect ! ! i hat big bulky watches . 
this is a good watch for the money ! 2nd one in ten years , used for work in the concrete field . it does take a licking for sure . the band it comes with is bad ! i just replaced mine with a leather band . 
i really researched this watch and found it on several online sites . i purchased from amazon . com since i have purchased many items here and have had great satisfaction . as far as this watch , the picture is a bit misleading as the bezel on this watch is more of a grey color than a silver . the watch also is almost all plastic with no weight to it so i am a bit skeptical to its quality . i have always owned timex so i am willing to give this watch a chance , but i am a bit disappointed . also the watch band was advertised as a buckle band , but came with a velcro band . i had to purchase another band . i do like the features of this watch . 
this watch looks like a 15 - 25 dollar watch , i put a new band on it and it looks ok . i do like the options it has and the indiglo , but the dial being plastic really puts this watch in the lower end category . it does keep time well . 
i bought this watch almost a week ago and like it a lot . it has a lot of features and since it is all plastic it is light compared to my metal watch . i found out that it has a feature i didn ' t know about - a snooze alarm ( do nothing when the alarm sounds and in 5 minutes the alarm sounds again ) . also , you can put this watch into night mode which means that the indiglo stays lit for 3 seconds while rotating though functions at night . the directions included were wrong and it was by calling timex that i figured this out - hold in the upper left button ( button 1 ) for 3 seconds to switch between day mode and night mode and not the lower right button in the directions ( button 3 ) . the rotating bi - directional bezel dial is a must for me . some other expedition watches with bezels are only for show and not operational so be careful . unfortunately the bezel is plastic on this watch and reminds me of gray pvc piping with black paint . it has 2 digital time zones and 1 analog . . . hence the 3 advertised but if you sync the digital and analog time then it ' s only 2 time zones . the second time zone only allows you to set the hour so i put the gmt time zone here . i like the calendar function on this watch . the year needs to be set on this along with the month and day . this means that it knows when a year contains a leap day and when it does not . also , setting times , dates and alarms are simplified by this watch allowing you to switch between whole numbers - to set 5 : 55 it gives you the ability to switch between each of the 3 fives . then there ' s the included black velcro band . what a waste . it needs a black twist o flex or black commando watch band . i opted for the black commando watch band since it can also protect the watch . 3 times now in the last 5 days the digital functions have frozen on me . twice when the chimes were on it stuck with an annoying ring that wouldn ' t stop . i found that this watch can be reset with by simultaneously pushing all 4 buttons at the same time . this resets everything except the analog portion of the watch and then you need to spend time setting the alarm and 2 time zones . bottom line is that the watch is nice but not aesthetically pleasing . it would have been nice to have an all metal watch with a rotating metal bezel that was analog and digital . this is a nice casual watch that is comfortable since it is light . edit : after having this watch for a month and looking at other brands of digital / analog watches i am convinced that timex has a corner on this market and that i made a good buy . other digital / analog watches i ' ve seen don ' t have a second hand and the digital display looks squashed and ugly . i like how the second hand makes a neat quiet sound and the time is easily visible from any angle . . . while the hourly chimes and indiglo light give me the best of both the analog and digital world ! ! i wound up getting a nice gray and black plastic / metal clasp band for $ 10 at a local jeweler that looks great ! edit 2 . . . 3 months of use now ! well i ' ve had this watch 3 months now and there isn ' t a scratch on the bezel or crystal - this is a very durable watch . . . even if it is plastic . i love this time piece ! i ' ve been looking at other brands digital / analogs and haven ' t found anything yet that i like more than timex . oh , more about the band . i ' ve replaced the band with 3 different styles now . you will need a 20 mm band where it goes into the watch ( the distance between the lugs ) . i tried a black twist o flex but didn ' t like how the one i had moved side to side . . . it was adjustable unlike the ones you buy on the watch already . i ' ve now settled on a black metal fixed band that easily adjusts at the clasp ( i found both on ebay for under $ 20 each brand new ) . hopefully timex will just do away with the velcro band and sell these watches with black twist o flex bands that are not adjustable . did i mention that the bezel actually moves and is useful ! why do watches have stationary bezels ? edit again . . . 6 months of use now ! i ' m still lovin this watch . i put another watch band on it . . . 4th band now . i went with a black 20mm modena ridgo ridged italian rubber watch band with a metal locking clasp ( i bought it here on amazon for $ 12 and like it a lot ) . something that i realized recently about it is that the crystal is recessed just a bit because of the bezel . not all dial watches are this way . i have a relic dial watch that is flush with the crystal - this is not good if you hit the wall with your watch . recessing the crystal the way timex has done protects your watch crystal . another reason timex has a customer for life ! 
i purchased this watch to take hiking on the appalachian trail . the watch stood up to the challenge . i was very impressed with the watchband . it ' s velcro material was comfortable and easily fit my large wrist . i was able to take it off and attach it to my backpack when not wearing the watch . the movable dial on top allowed me to keep an eye on the time i was taking between breaks or over miles without having to remember exactly what time i started . it all a very durable watch . 
i bought this watch to replace an older timex that had the equivalent features . my previous one had a stainless steel housing and band , and was more formal looking . but i have true dress watches , and this was for everyday wear . compared to my older model , this one has a back that is attached with screws , which i expect would make it easier to change the battery . it is rated water resistant to a lower depth . and it has a velcro band . i can ' t give a lower rating because of the band , since you can buy a version of this watch with other bands if you want . the advantage of the band is that you don ' t have to worry about taking out or inserting links to adjust the size , but you get a less formal band . a cloth band can potentially be irritating , but it has not been a general concern for me . you get an analog and digital display , two time zones ( the description says 3 but the instructions and my experience say 2 ) , which i find very convenient for travel , and a chronograph / lap timer , which i find generally useful for timing things . you also get an alarm and a count down timer , so it ' s easy to figure out how much time has gone by or how much is left . the instructions are a bit cryptic , and it ' s not always intuitive how to set each function . but for the ones you use regularly , it should not be a problem to learn . the minute or hour hand will sometimes block the window at the bottom , making it impractical to see the current date . but that might be true of all analog / digital displays . 
i ' ve owned three of these watches , they aren ' t pretty , but darn they work well . a number of years ago , i decided to upgrade from this watch , and buy a victronix swiss army watches that was a bit nicer looking . after going through four bands on that watch and the bands no longer available , i needed a new watch . well , here you go , back to the old standby . in fact today , it ' s less expensive than what i paid many years ago . the watch face is large and easy to read . i like the ivory color and the large analog hands . one requirement for me was two times on my watch . i travel a lot and i always set the analog hands to where i am and leave the digital time with home time . this watch works perfectly for that purpose . the band is nothing special to look at , it is functional . both the analog and digital time is very accurate . the packaging is super nice . timex has done away with all the fancy plastic landfill packages and gone with a very simple red cardboard box . i like that a lot . no waste , no landfill garbage , just a well protected watch . it ' s wonderful to be back with my old friend the timex expedition watch . 
this item was also a gift to a young teen who lives several hours from where i live . according to his grandfather , he put it on and is wearing the watch . i may see this young man this summer . 
a little hard to set up at first but once i figured out the button system it was a snap . really love the nylon strap . it is cool to wear and looks very stylish . would recommend this watch to any active person 
firstly , this watch looks better in the photo than it does in real life . it has a cheap plastic look and a flimsy feel and the band should be ashamed of itself . now that i have the negatives out of the way let me roll in the positives . you get a good watch for the money with tons of features . despite what other reviewers have said about bits and pieces breaking and falling off , i have not experienced this . my watch has held up very good . i must admit that i only wear it once a week and have not subjected it to it ' s true purpose . . . outdoor activities . as an avid collector and lover of wrist watches i rotate my stock . features : the alarm is quite loud , louder than my other expeditions , it actually wakes me up . the three times zones are useful for travelling . 24 hour countdown timer is very handy for those who need it , and although i don ' t use the rotating bezel , others may find this useful as a second timer , for whatever reason . all digital expeditions have a stopwatch so nothing new there . indiglo night light is adaquate , with the night mode feature being a bonus . i have found this watch to keep very good time , only losing a few beats per month , like all timex quartz watches . i recomend this as a good knock around watch , but if you ' re looking for something really sturdy that will hold up well out in the field then look elsewhere . go for g shock or a pathfinder or a citizen protek or the like . all in all a good watch for the hard earned you will outlay . 
i love the looks of this watch , but it ' s a terrible design . the wrist band did fit my large arm . timex makes a watch i love - the expedition indigo with a alarm that has two stems and it ' s all analog . it is also discontinued , so i bought the last one i could find . this watch was supposed to replace my favorite , but it ' s a poor alternative , despite the title . this watch glows , but it ' s hard to find the right button ( there are 5 to fumble with ) . the indigo lighted dial is much dimmer and nearly useless to me . the digital part of this watch is hard to program and not very useful for it ' s stated purpose . i hate what you have to do to set an alarm or to monitor it . the date display is hard to read and poorly designed . 
i bought this watch for my son so he would have a good watch for boot camp . . . . sad . . . it started falling apart in the first month 
i ' ve had one of these for a couple of weeks . i wear my watch on the inside of my wrist , and when i used to have a similar watch in a thick metal case the noise of it hitting my desk was distracting . while still thick , the plastic case on this watch eliminates that for the most part . it has the same mechanism as the old watch , and so far has kept perfect time . one other big advantage over the old design is that the hands are so short they don ' t block the digital display nearly as much as before . but unlike the old watch , only the hands are luminous , and it isn ' t as readable in poor light without using the illuminator - which is still on the left side of the case , making it a bit awkward to use if it ' s on the left arm . i have no idea what purpose the bezel serves , but the crystal is recessed inside it , so maybe it ' s there for protection . it ticks quietly , and has a loud alarm . only big strike against it so far is the factory strap . it looks and feels like canvas , and would probably last forever ; but it ' s ugly and it itched , so i replaced it with a leather strap . those plastic things that hold the strap to the watch are very tightly fitted , and it was a royal pain to get them off . 
i got this for my niece and she loves it and wears it all the time with her many pink outfits . 
my ten year old daughter is happy with how it looks and feels and was able to figure out how to use all the functions on her own . 
i bout this for my eight year old , she loves it , wears it everyday and it has been dropped , stepped on , and abused , and still works perfectly . very durable for an active child . 
love this watch . could not find it this year and really wanted it for my other granddaughter . the features are great for a kid ! my granddaughter sets timer and or alarm for when she is to be back home and the indiglo light is a plus . a very good quality watch for kids . water resistant as well . highly recommend . cost is reasonable . 
functionally this watch is great , a young girl ( say , 7 ) can understand its functions and the timer and alarm all work fine . the reason this is getting 3 stars ( and that ' s being kind ) is that the strap when done up around that same girl has its end sticking up . this is because her wrist is small ( even though above average dimensions for age ) and so only half of the velcro attaches , with the rest stuck up at the top . there is also a huge timex logo in the way of where more velcro could go . as a result the strap comes easily undone . this is frustrating because it ' s such a stupid oversight on timex ' s part . if not for that logo in the way they could have had more velcro and then no problem . i have had the same girl try an adult female timex with a rubber strap and lots of holes and it actually fits just fine , so that ' s the one this will be replaced with . timex , fix the strap and actually allow young kids to wear it and then you get five stars . 
good 
ken looks good in this outfit . he has few pieces but , he can look good inthe clothes that were bought here . 
this hat has a slight shortcoming in that it doesn ' t have a true " pouch " effect in back or on top . the description says that it ' s supposed to have room for long hair or dreads , but mine won ' t fit unless put in one tight braid , and it ' s very jammed in . there ' s not enough fabric or gathering in the back / at the bottom to stuff it all up and in . my hair is past - my - waist long , but many people have bigger hair than i . not a true dread hat . besides that it ' s a great hat . i like it so much i ' ve ordered it in other colors . 
love this hat ! got it really quick . i will def be buying this hat in different colors . fits nice , doesn ' t bother my ears . 
because the price is so affordable , i was surprised that the material is high quality , andthe fit is perfect . it is one of the best bargains around ! 
the price for this was great , and it is a nice , soft " newsie " style hat . the only caution i have is that it does not fit a bigger head . i wound up having to transfer it to another cast member with a slightly smaller head . but it looks great onstage ! 
great for the price , and it was the perfect look for my female team rocket grunt cosplay . however this hat is not for people with big heads . overall i have a somewhat small head and this hat is still a snug fit . 
i was recently at a space themed kid ' s party and the birthday boy received one of these from his parents right before the party started . he was absolutely thrilled to have appropriate attire for the party . like most little kids he enjoyed dressing up and it made the theme even more fun . 
my son loves this costume , and still wears it all these months later . it is very realistic looking and they have taken great play out of it ! i was not impressed with this seller , though , but other than that , were happy with the purchase . do not get the boots that are advertised as going with this ( sold separately ) as they are terrible ! they don ' t fit properly , are nearly impossible to get over shoes , and look ridiculously big on . . . 
my son loves his costume ! he wore it for career day at school , then decided he wanted to wear it for halloween as well . ( he was originally going to be iron man . ) it is really well made , and the hat that comes with it is nice as well ! 
this is a super cute costume that my son wore to school for his famous american project . he was neil armstrong and this worked out well for that part . it ' s well made and it fit him perfect but beware my son normally wears a size 10 in pants ( we bought a 12 / 14 ) so in my opinion this does run a little small . my son is about 4 ' 9 and 60lbs . 
super great suit that we bought for our daughter . the quality is really good and the suit looks like a real nasa outfit . she loves it so much , she wears it monthly . getting small though . . . : ) 
this little treasure box is just beautiful ! it has such a magical touch . they are small in size so don ' t expect it to hold a bunch of jewelry . however , it is a fun little box with little drawers that makes it perfect for any little girl to stash a few trinkets . 
i have purchased 3 now as gifts for 5 year olds and their eyes light up when they see these . it is beautiful inside and out and looks like it is very well made . the song is nice and the tiny & # 34 ; secret & # 34 ; compartments make it so fun ! 
i rated it 5 stars because of my granddaughter ' s delight . she does not notice the imperfections of the printed paper , nor the almost crude little ballerina . it is small and just right for my 5 year old granddaughter to carry around , which she has done for some time . i think it rather sturdy . 
my granddaughter loves all the hidey spots and uses it to save her money and little jewelry items . she loves winding it and watching the little ballerina turn . a nice gift for a little girl ! 
i so want to give a four or five star review for this little ballerina box . it ' s gorgeous ! the cunning little drawers ! the sweet , soft ballerina paintings ! it plays swan lake ! but , oops , it did play swan lake . the wind up mechanism broke after only a few days , and now the ballerina does not twirl and the pretty box is silent . my little girl still likes it , and maybe this is just the way of ballerina boxes , but i wish it were more durable . 
the box looks quite charming on - line . the reality is that it is a small cheap looking item . the drawers are tiny . it will be very difficult to get anything out of the side drawers unless you use tweezers . 
i had been looking for the perfect ballerina jewelry box for my daughter for a while . i saw this one , and loved it ! my daughter loves it as well , and she loves how it has drawers in different spots on the box ! 
i purchased this for my 5yr old for christmas and she absolutely loves it . she ' s very much into her ballerina tutu and shoes , and will play the music and store her & # 34 ; little treasures & # 34 ; in it . nice little box for kids . 
nice supportive shoes that aren ' t totally flat ( this is suprisingly hard to find ) . i also sometimes have problems with slip ons that come up to the ankle with my high arches ( cant get my foot in the shoe ! ) but this is not at all a problem . very cute with the design too . i ' m a 9 . 5 or 10 and take a 10 in these . 
i love these shoes . i put them on and forget i am wearing any shoes . they fit right to my foot so well . i wore these at a conference where i was running around all day . i gave them a 5 star rating because they are so comfortable and for not being leather , ( vegan ) , they were a great dressy shoe . 
these seem absurdly narrow for c / d , but they have become more comfortable over time . great cushion . well made . i love the slip - on sneaker comfort disguised in a work shoe . 
these shoes run small . i always wear size 9 but after reading other reviews i ordered 9 1 / 2 and they are a little tight . you should definitely order a half size up , or maybe even a full size up if you want to wear socks or add your own insoles . these shoes don ' t get a 5 star rating because they have & # 34 ; faux fur & # 34 ; insoles that don ' t come out ( or at least i haven ' t found a way to get them out yet ) . i would rather use my own insoles , and i only want faux fur in my slippers or maybe winter boots . 
got these for my daughter , a college student , and she loves them . she can slip them on to ride her bike to school . they are comfortable like tennis shoes , but cute and stylish at the same time . she is an art student and has to stand for hours for some of her classes and these guys have enough cushion and support to keep her feet comfortable . 
i bought this for my 2 year old to wear at his plane birthday and he liked wearing is backwards . it was cute for pictures and perfect for his head . 
this feels so real ! my daughter wants to be a pilot when she grows up . so wanted a pilot cap . i ran into this and spent the $ $ $ . boy it ' s good quality . good size . she loves wearing it ! 
the pilot hat was great in size and everything was perfrect , this was also for my son career day which he was outstanding as a pilot because i made the shirt and the pants . i also received my stuff on time . i must say thank you to all the staff of amazon . 
my grandson loves hats he ' s two and loves imaginative play we bought this for christmas so he hasn ' t gotten it yet . was a little dissappointed that it was soft and thought it would have a firm crisp shape but i guess soft is better for play . its different from anything else so i ' m sure he will love it 
my 5 year old loves airplanes and pilots . we got him this hat and he just loves it . he looks very cute and it fits well . looks well made , too . highly recommend it . 
my niece loves being in charge or her own ship or airplane or any other moving object she can imagine ! this captain ' s hat is a great piece for playing make believe ! 
luv em 
these look much better in the pictures than they did when i received them . i bought them as a gift and was too embarrassed to give them . i sent them back and bought a better ( but more expensive ) pair . 
i had some cabelas polarized sunglasses that were getting old and they didn ' t sell them any more . so , i stumbled on calcuttas . i got a different model and like them a lot . the sizing is a little tight on the back of my head - i ' m hoping they loosen up some to be more comfortable . in terms of sun blocking , they are not super dark , but fine for low light to normal sun light . i like them and would buy them again . 
great looks and good vision . only thing that is a bit annoying is they are a bit tight on my head . otherwise i would recommend them whole heartedly . 
i broke my sisters sunglasses when we were on a trip and so glad to find these so i could replace them . she was very happy . 
this hat was not quite what i expected . i noticed that when i put it on it did not look right . the top portion was too soft , and kind of " mushroomed " out when i put it on my head , making it kind of silly looking . i returned it . at least that was easy . 
although the hat smells like chemicals , its adorable ( and hey , i suppose i know for sure it ' s new right ? ) i will certainly order more colors of this hat , but i will look for another seller . my hat was over a week late and when i got the box it looked like megatron and his transformer friends had played football with my package ; while i can ' t fault the seller for what the postal service does i can absolutely fault them for their piss poor service . when i kindly and concisely asked for a status on my week late package , the following is the response i received : " hello . please contact amazon / fba team . they handled your order and will have information . " really ? could you at least pretend to be sorry or care ? got it , it ' s a straight forward situation and not " your problem " ehats , but your manner of handling customers and the impression it leaves is 110 % your problem . i am not impressed . 
i bought this for a work hat . most hats do not fit my head . this one does , and the color works well with all the dust that im around . i happy i bought it . 
i love & # 10084 ; this cap ! it is the most comfortable cap i have ever worn ! ! love the green color , have had it for about 8 months , washes well , holding together . i want to get one in black . i wish all caps were this comfortable ! ! ! 
i have one of those extra large heads ( to house my gynormous brain ) and this hat does fit , but it looks a bit strange on me as if there ' s not really enough material on the hat for extra large heads , like 80 percent of my head is covered then the adjustable band gets the other 20 percent . it would be better if they increased the size . 
this hat looks cute and good quality , nice price . i was worried about the size but just fit good size . 
i recommend this cap . the quality is great , and the color is really cool ~ ! worth for that price ! and you can change the size of this cap too . i ' m really happy about it and i just love it . 
this is a well made low profile hat with an adjustable band . it ' s a great hat for people that don ' t particularity like hats . 
made in chinaquality constructionfast shippingreasonable price . 100 % cotton . the only reason i gave this cap 4 stars and not 5 is because of the color . it could have been better in my opinion . it ' s not a khaki with green in it . it ' s more of a desert khaki with red . 
i was satisfied with the quality and style of this product . i recommend this product to any customer , and i like the comfort of this product . additionally the delivery from amazon was satisfactory and met my needs . 
de un color super chevere , te proteje del sol , te calza perfectamente en tu cabeza , muy comoda , elegente y servicial , recomendada , la puedes utilizar con cualquier tipo de ropa . 
they sent me a youth large , i assumed this hat was an adult one size fits most not a child ' s ! i bought this as a birthday gift for my husband but instead gave it to my 4 year old son . definitely not what i intended . 
i am truly in love with this hat . i also bought a blue one . i love it so much i think i ' ll buy more colors . 
this cap is so cute . . . . put it on and fell in love . nice color of grey . can fit many head sizes . looking for army green now as this short style peak good for me . 
when my fiance got this one he was very pleased . he wore a leather one i bought him for christmas every day and he was worried it would be to hot for summer . but these last few days he ' s wore this cap and is in love with it . its dressier then a baseball hat and a little bit more mature but provides the same coverage though . the material is sturdy without being thick or heavy so it ' s breathable . i recomend this cap for those who dont want to hear its to hot for a hat and sunburned scalps this summer . 
i love everything about this hat fit well and a great weekend or bad hair day hat it worth every pennie . 
this is a good cap . what you can ' t see online - four round air holes at the top sides of it . will probably fit any size head . 
this cap looks good and fits very well . it is comfortable . i really like it a lot . color is good . 
i didn ' t expect the quality to be as good for the price i paid for this . it was very nice quality ! ordered the grey and was pleased with the tone . adjustable in the back for a good fit . will order other colors now . 
i am not a fan of caps but i found this quite nice . price was fair enoughquality a + + dispatch a + + + price a + 
cool cap , not much to say - just another happy buyer ! ps : quality is not super as expected of course , but for me fit is way more important . 
a good hat . yes it is adjustable but my head is just a bit too big for it . i can wear it but it is a bit snug . oh , i usually wear a 7 3 / 4 & # 34 ; to 8 & # 34 ; in hats . if that helps . 
i really like these and the way it looks on your head . it does fit a bit large , but that may be my head ' s fault : ) i ' ll just adjust the velcro part and it should be good . 
i ' m a female with an average size american head and this hat fits me perfect , plus adjusts well . the style is what i ' d been looking for and i ' d like to buy some more in the future 
i love , love , love this hat . it ' s many steps up from my usual baseball cap . i also bought a gray one . maybe i need more colors . 
good price for a decent cover . plan on getting at least one more in a different color . buy one ; you ' ll like it . . 
this is a cool cap , but it cannot be sized larger than medium ( at least the one we got ) . i gave it to my grandson who loves it . 
i love this hat . i have a small head so the fit was perfect . it ' s also very comfortable , you forget you even have it one . love it ! ! 
this hat is as advertized and broke in , good fit and has the right feel for an old pair of jeans . shipment was quick . 
great hat 
really like this cap . . i need caps with visors as i ride a bike and deal with sun issues . i have a few . i decorate them with various little bits of jewelry , and beads , and they look unique . this cap works very well . very comfortsble too . 
i have found that the sandy / reef flip flops are consistent in size and quality - i wear nothing else . wonderful product . 
finally ordered my new reefs . i have three pair from years ago . they are made a bit differently . first , the footbed is textured which is very nice . they are oh - so comfortable . secondly , they will wear just as long as the old ones . it seems products change with time to save money , you expect the same and get less than expected . not so with these . go ahead , order a few pair , you ' ll be glad you did . 
i love these shoes . they are comfortable and durable . i had to order another pair when i lost my first . 
i ' ve always loved reef sandals . these run small fyi . i wear a 7 in pretty much everything and had to get these in size 8 . 
got these after reviewing many different styles and brands . very happy with purchase . can wear for hours walking all day and feet are still happy . with time , shoes have conformed to my feet . will buy again ! 
i normally wear 8 . 5 - 9 in shoes . according to these reviews i needed to order a 10 , so i did . i can ' t ever wear flip flops because it hurts my knees after a while , but i was able to walk around the beach and downtown on our vacation like a champ ! didn ' t even think about them ! i will be ordering more when the weather warms up . 
so comfortable ! ! ! perfect combination of support and comfort . just what i was looking for in flip flops . i ' m very particular and it ' s just about all i wear from the first 60 + degree day till it gets below 60 again . fabric strap is very comfy don ' t even know you have anything between your toes . i do think they run small . i wear an 8 . 5 and usually order 9 because i don ' t like my heel to hang off , not sure if it ' s the placement of the thong portion , but there is way more in front of my toes than behind my heel . so be careful if you are a true 9 , it may be too short . just my observation . i want more pairs in more colors ! 
i read other reviews stating to get a size larger . this is true . i am a size 8 shoe , however , i purchased the size 9 sandals . they do run on the smaller size . i wish there was a little more clearance around my foot ( more shoe around my the bottom of my foot ) , however , they do the job and they look nice . i guess it all comes down to preference . 
i bought these to replace ones that i had worn out after 4 years of heavy use . these are very comfortable and long lasting . hats off to reef for great flip flops . 
took advice from other reviewers and bought a size bigger than what i normally wear . got the sandals and had to immediately send them back for replacement because they were way too big for me . got the one size down replacement and have been wearing them for 3 months . never chafed , never a blister ( unlike other flip flops ) . my one complaint is that even at my normal size they are still too big . i can wear them but they are quite loose and the pad sticks out an inch beyond my foot . my guess is that because these are completely open and not closed shoes that it is possible that i wear a 7 in this type of footwear ( never purchased this type on - line before ; just tried some cheap ones on in a store and bought them with no attention to size lol ! ) i haven ' t worn a 7 shoe since i was a teenager a very long time ago . so , i ' m thinking about ordering another pair in a 7 and keeping these 8s as a spare . . . or give them to someone . they haven ' t worn a bit and are extremely comfortable . best casual flip flops for the money . 
sent these back . i like the ginger better . ginger seems to be better quality and sizing is more accurate . i got an 8 and it was too small . 
i ' m a southern girl , and as soon as the weather hits 60 degrees , the standard footwear around these parts are flip flops . so i can honestly say that i ' ve tried out a fair share of flip flops , and reef ' s sandy flip flops are by far the best out there . they are comfortable , durable , and affordable . plus they look cute with all my summer outfits ! 
arrived on time . wore them during my cruise to the bahamas . sturdy , comfortable and cute ! i ' ll be buying more in different colors . 
i love these reef flip flops . i bought a pair last year ( sized up as per reviews ) and they were as supportive and comfortable as described . i bought exactly the same pair again this year but had to give them to my daughter as half a size larger was too small in this years ' version . definitely buy a whole size up but do buy ! 
i got these sandals after reading numerous reviews raving about them . i personally don ' t find them to be off the chart . they are bit stiff and even though there is a rough bottom to them , i feel like they are kind of slippery on some surfaces . they aren ' t completely uncomfortable but i ' ve definitely owned more comfortable sandals for less money . 
sooooo comfortable but they do run small i ' m usually . true size 7 and i had to return for a size 8 they fit perfectly ! most amazing sandles i ' ve owned . 
i love these flip flops . they ' re so much more comfortable than my rainbows . i only wish i had discovered them sooner . they ' re soft on my feet , yet i can still wear them a decent distance ( as far as flip flops go ) . 
my sister turned me on to reef ' s years ago , but it ' s since been years since i ' ve bought a pair . i ran across these on amazon and didn ' t think twice about buying them ! i am pleased with my purchase and it arrived in a timely manner . they are pretty true to size , but maybe just a hair big . i wear a size 7 . while these fit pretty well , i wouldn ' t be upset if they were a half size smaller . again , the most comfortable flip - flop you can buy . . . get them ! ! ; ) 
this is one of the better - reviewed flip flops besides teva mush ( the original is supposed to be stellar but they ' ve replaced it with mush ii which is supposedly not as good ) . so i bought them and have been pleasantly surprised . i was skeptical about the wide straps . i don ' t have huge feet but i thought they would look a bit masculine and sometimes the wide straps make your toes look funny . but it fits great and feels and looks good . i am normally an 8w or 8 . 5 , but had to size up for a 9 . it ' s perfect . 
i purchased these flip - flops due to the high number of good reviews , and also to test out the brand . however , after owning them a short while , i feel they are overrated ( or perhaps i received a knock - off or defective pair ) . the good : the fit is fine ( they probably run about a half - size smaller than most flip - flops in the u . s . ) the style is okay . they appear just as they do in the picture . i don & # 8217 ; t find them particularly stylish , but not unattractive either . they are quite comfortable ( which is stated repeatedly in the reviews and is the main reason i purchased them ) , but not much more so than other flip - flops i own ( they are a bit thicker than most , while still remaining light on the feet ) . the bad : the material of the flip - flops tends to attract pet hair and dust particles ( not the fabric part , but the rest of it ) , which collects quite badly along the sides when wearing . this seems odd , considering they are intended as foot gear & # 8230 ; most walking surfaces contain these elements . also , the dye in them bleeds onto the feet , which bothered me a lot because it made them seem very cheaply made . i have never encountered this problem before , even with cheap flip - flops i have purchased at local stores . overall , i didn & # 8217 ; t find anything that would keep me coming back to this brand in the future . i will continue to search for a shoe brand i can fall in love with . until then , i will likely stick with skechers ( one of the best brands i have found so far ) . 
i love these flip flops so much that i want more . so comfortable and a try fit . never had any that were this comfortable even on the first day all day . 
i am not able to wear these yet . it is still snowing here in indiana . i did try them out right after i received them . i like the way they look and feel . they are made of good quality . they were all i hoped they would be . i will keep an update , should i change my mind , if the weather ever clears up . these shoes ( sandals ) will match anything . that is the main reason , besides comfort , that i chose these . i haven ' t bought a new pair of sandals in years . don ' t really like having to buy shoes , don ' t wear them that much . unless , i have to . 
i love reef sandals . i bought a pair for myself last summer and i liked them so much i convinced my wife to let me buy her a pair . this is the style she selected . she ' s always saying she wants to buy two more pairs in different colors because these are so much more comfortable than the $ 5 flipflops from old navy she ' s been abusing her feet with . 
i love these flip flops ! ! they are very soft and comfortable from the moment i put them on . no break in period required . 
i have been wearing this flop flop for weeks . they cushion the foot , but feel like wearing slippers . i will look for the reef name if i want more colors . 
these flip flops are so easy on your feet . i have very tender feet , especially between my toes and i can wear these all day . i do find these to be pretty true to size . i wear a 7 1 / 2 , i bought a size 8 . they are just a tad to big , but very comfortable anyway . i thought a little pricey , bur probably worth it . 
i just received 2 pairs of reef sandy flip flops 1 black and 1 brown , while this style does run a bit small it is the original reef style with the wider strap and has the best support and comfort . the timely arrival is a great source of joy for my feet , now i have 10pair of reef ' s . thanks amazon you are the best 
this flip flop was somewhat small , but comfortable . i gave them to my daughter inlaw , she loves them andcommented on their comfort . 
these are the best flip flops . comfortable and long lasting . i can ' t say enough great things about these flip flops . great value , stylish , comfortable . highly recommend . 
these are very comfy and should last awhile given the thickness of the sole and width of the top fabric 
firstly i am sorry i purchased it , the strap part is sort of tight with one side tighter than the other i am thoroughly disappointed , you need tiny slim feet to probably feel comfy in this i an true 6 size but this has a funny feel , waste of money , no i want my money back ! 
these flip flops are very comfy and great for walking , i like them a lot . i would recommend them to anyone . 
based on the other reviews , i expected the sole of these flip flops to be a lot more comfortable than they are which is why i only gave it 4 stars . it ' s a bit like a stiff board and not very cushy , but comfortable enough for me to walk around the house and do errands . the upper part and the piece in between the toes is fabric and very comfortable and doesn ' t rub . i think the bottom will conform more to my feet after i wear them a while . overall would recommend . 
these are a great pair of slippers . i wish the straps were not as shiny but the slippers are comfortable like all my other reefs . i really love them and will get the black . 
they were cushy which was why i bought them . the fabric straps were a little flimsy but workable . the black foam rubber though was a deal breaker . not only will it make your feet black but itabsorbs water and squish squishes and gets slippery . gave them to the goodwill . 
reef does not disappoint , very resistant , looks good , easy to wash , i ware it every day . really love this sandals 
i have been an avid fan of reef flip flops for years because of their excellent construction , great arch support and phenominal comfort . what other flip flop can you wear all day and not have tired / hurting feet , legs and back ? i will always buy any reef flip flop over any other brand ~ no matter the cost since they last forever ! 
i love reefs . i loved that they shipped quickly and fit well . i have had mine last forever before . so far these are shaping up to be the same . i love the cushion on these rather than the & # 34 ; walking on the floor & # 34 ; feel . i could walk in these all day ! 
comfortable and true to size . i ' ve been wearing reef sandals for years and i have no intention of switching to anything else . 
i love these flip - flops so much that i have literally worn out two pairs and have had to buy a third pair . they are great quality and feel amazing . i am a hairstylist and wear these every day in the summer time , even when i ' m working , and my feet never hurt ! they are very comfortable . 
these seem more comfortable than most flip flops but fit strangely . my heel comes right to the back but there ' s too much room in the front . this is particularly odd because , having longish toes , i usually experience the reverse . i ' ll probably return them . 
extremely comfortable , and an attractive flip flop . but , the soles of my feet are stained black every day ! i started noticing black foot prints in the tub . quit wearing the reef , and the footprints are gone ! 
nice quality , i can see that i ' ll get good use out of these shoes but i normally wear a 8 / 8 . 5 and ordered up a size . these are still small . they ' ve improved as the top has stretched out but even the sole is shorter than what i ' d consider an average 9 . i ' ll keep them as i think i can make them work but would order an even larger size next time . 
i have a pair previously i like these sandals they have good soles - to protect your feet wide enough 
i am one of those people who wear flip flops as daily footwear . i love the reef products and the quality is always top notch . 
after repeatd buying of disposable sandals at payless , i decided to get her a pair of good and comfortable sandals ! she loves them ! 
this is my second summer wearing them and they are still in great shape and super cushiony . i generally am trying to wear more supportive sandals and shoes , but these are great for days when i ' m doing less walking and just want to feel comfy . 
i usually wear a 7 / 7 . 5 and order these in an 8 because the 7 ' s are just to small . very comfortable and go great with a casual summer look . 
wife is wearing these at the beach now . she has a high instep , so she loves the arch on these attractive flip flops . 
i love reefs . i have been a long time reef owner for 15 years or more . they are the most comfortable flip flop sandal ; ) i love the basic black too , they ' re perfect ! 
these flip flops are very comfortable & i got them at a great price . it doesn ' t get any better than that ! ! 
flips flops are sturdy , durable yet straps are soft and comfy . for my preference , these are an excellent purchase . will purchase from reef again , without hesitation . 
i always know i can count on reef flip flops - i order them usually a half size bigger so my heel has plenty of room and won ' t slip off the back and that works great for me . this color is very rich and pretty with tan skin . 
i wear a size 5 reef in ginger , but the sandy style runs small and i order these in a 6 and they fit perfectly . i love this flip flop and the colors are great . i ' ve worn them a ton already and they have held up better than my tevas . reef is my brand for flip flops . 
these are very comfortable . i am replacing a similar pair i have had for several years . great product , great brand ! 
the sizing is perfect and they are very comfortable . enough other people have noted on here how amazing these are , the only reason i feel compelled to write a review is that i was looking at old order and realized that i am still wearing these flip flops two years later ! that ' s two hard summer ' s worth of use ( wearing for quite a bit of walking every day ) and two fall / winter / spring ' s worth of use ( wearing pretty constantly when it is warm enough for flip flops in slc ) . 
i like these slippers and they are soft and comfortable ; but they run big . i should have purchased a size smaller , they have room at the back and even looks like they may stretch a bit after numerous wears . the slipper seems like they would have been comfy , but i hate the fit . they have the sizing wrong . 
i bought the awol and bought 2 more different styles . comfort not the same . the color is nice and pretty just not as comfortable 
i already own a pair of reef ' s and i love them . they are 3 years old and still are in pretty good condition concerding how much i wear them . these one are a bit different than the ones i had - more of a foam like bottom , where my other one formes to the shape of my foot ( i love that ) still a great flippy floppy ! 
just as expected , my daughter loved her new reefs . they fit perfectly and were reasonable priced . they wear well also . 
my most recent pair of flip flops were all rubber and , although they are easy to clean , they are not comfortable . this time i wanted a pair that had a more cushioning sole and softer piece that goes over the foot . for flip flops , these are stylish and comfortable and the size is true to my shoe size . ( if there is any question , go to the next higher size . ) these are too nice for yardwork ( will keep the old rubber ones for that . ) 
super cute , comfy , definitely getting another pair in case these wear out . what else is there to say ? i love em : ) 
they are comfortable and sturdy i practically lived in them all summer . but they aren ' t anything special ; just a good pair of flip flops for your closet . 
these are wearable , but i have other reef flip flops that seem much more comfortable than these . i ' m hoping these ones will break in with time . they look the same as my other ones . they are sturdy and fit as expected . 
love them . fit perfectly and even in the worst humidity my feet don ' t sweat . i wish they came in more colors . 
fit perfectly and are totally comfortable , worth every pennythe strap is a bit wide , so will leave a tan line , but who cares 
my other flip flops are sturdier - but as they are all rubber , in the hot texas summer they stick to me . these have a cloth / polyester top so are much better for the summer . not the highest quality - but not bad for the price . 
i love reef ' s and for the price you can ' t pass it up ! i went to a store to try them on to make sure my size was accurate and then ordered them on here . i love them ! ! ! ! 
these flip flop sandals are quite comfortable to wear and seem durable . they give very good support for a flip flop . they look good for everyday casual wear . i inadvertently ordered a size larger than i should have ( kept them ) , but i think they would have been plenty big had i ordered the right size . 
the flip flops were nice . i liked the design and the way they were made . they fit nice and look good . 
first off its not attractive looking . and it feels stiff and bulky and flat . arch support really ? i don ' t feel it at all . it hurt my foot after i wore it a little in the house ( didn ' t even walk around whole much ) . very uncomfortable . can ' t believe the price ! ! ! if this is what reef offers for all other sandals and it ' s considered one of the best ones they have , i say reef sucks . 
i have narrow feet , so sometimes flip - flops are so wide i walk right out of them . these fit really well , and are very soft and comfortable . 
i had a pair of these flip flop years ago and loved them so when i found them again i had to buy them . they did not disappoint ! they are comfy and can be worn all day . they are a little wider than my feet which is the only thing that i may change but i still love them . 
the best all around flip flop for the price . strap is wide which is great for comfort and fit . love them ! 
i love these shoes - flip flops . they are very cute and comfortable . my boyfriend even commented on them . he liked them too . 
these are not size 9 shoes and the straps were too tight . if you want these get them a size bigger than your normal . the also turn you feet black when you wear them . needless to say , i wear them . i should have sent them back , but they fit me and i wore them . too bad . . . . 
perfect cut , totally true to size . ( i wear an 11 ) very comfortable . i had two other pairs of this brand ( not this style ) and they were great , too . i have a wide foot and the straps are a tad tight but after wearing them for a few hours , they seemed to stretch just a bit and with no blisters . i will wear these every day and all summer . 
i have been wearing reef sandy for a few years now . they are one of the most comfortable pairs i own . i hope reef continues to make these particular ones . the strap is so comfortable and they never bother between the toes . arch support is awesome . i love these . 
bought these flip flops for my daughter who says they are comfortable and pretty . she wears them almost until the snow flies . they do not irritate her toes . 
i ' ve been wearing reef flip flops for over 15 years now . each pair manages to last 2 - 3 years before they become the grimy , muddy , yuck outside the door shoe ( only because the sole is worn down ) . you know , slip on to go out and drag the trashcans back in . i can wear these comfortably and walk all day vacation , beach , shopping , around the house they are my summer go to shoe . hail to the reef ! 
i am so happy with my purchase , they fit perfect , i ordered the same size that i usually wear with all shoes and these are very comfortable . . . even the part that goes in between the toes is so light and comfortable you can barely tell it ' s there . these sandals are made well and that being said , they seem to be a great price . also , very cute , i love the way they look and there ' s many color choices . i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good / cute summer sandal . 
i like the way this particular style of reefs fit . and the pattern is cute , especially with ones with color . 
the are just the right color brown and i love the wide strap . reef makes the best and most comfortable flip flops . . 
i love reef flip flops and these are very cute too . love the pink and purple colors because they go with lots of my clothes . 
i was looking for a good all around flip flop with some added support and i am not disappointed . love these ! 
item came super quick . i love sandals and would wear them at all times if the weather would allow it . these are super comfortable sandals . very happy with my purchase . 
i am a huge fan of reef sandals . these are my absolute favorite . they fit well and mold to your feet after a few uses . i buy new ones each year when my old ones wear out . love these . great price on amazon . com . cheaper than local retailers in my area . 
these are good sandals although i prefer the reef cushion flip flops ( i recommend those instead ! ) these are also a bit snug and run small . i normally wear a 7 . 5 but ordered an 8 because i like my flip flops to be a little more roommy . however , even the 8 was snug . i suggest sizing up ! check out their cushion sandal instead ! 
after years of listening to other people talk glowingly about what i had considered to be their overpriced reefs , i am now a complete reef convert . i suffer from plantar faciitis and kept seeing reefs being recommended as the flip flop to use . i wish i hadn ' t spent so long trying to justify the cost of the flipflops against the $ 1 . 99 version - the difference between them is not comparable . i love these sandals ! ! for the first time in a year i can actually walk around relatively pain - free ! these sandals are true to size . they fit snugly / securely , but not tight . arch support is good , heel support is wonderful . i wouldn ' t say the sole is soft enough that totally moulds itself to your foot but it does conform to you ; it has a certain amount of give and it is not stiff and inflexible . i wear these indoors , outdoors , to the beach , on pavement , to the mall . i even had to buy a dressier pair of reefs to be able to wear in less casual occasions ! since buying these sandies , i have since bought 2 more pairs of reefs . the stargazer ( 4 stars ) and the mallory scrunch ( 2 stars ) . 
these are very comfortable shoes . the wide band is great too . they don ' t slip when walking . i am now wearing them quite often and the brown is a great match for a lot f summer clothes . 
the flip flop is very comfortable and has about 1 & # 34 ; to 1 . 2 & # 34 ; of sole and the cushion is not soft but not hard either , that ' s what i was looking for . i ' m happy with the purchase . 
it ' s a great flip flop . it has cushion which is perfect so you don ' t feel like you are walking on the street . they are very comfortable and i would buy them again ! 
love reef sandy flip flops can ' t say enough good things . . . . squishy , comfortable and just perfect . i ' ll keep wearing them as long as they keep making them ! 
i purchased this and had it sent to my daughter - way over yonder on the eastern part of our usa . i ' m on the western side . anyhoo . . . . . . . my daughter sent me a list of flip flops she liked and i chose this pair . i did suggest we get her a size 9 but my daughter insisted an 8 would be perfect . they barely fit and she ' ll make due since i ' m not getting another pair and she ' s not sending this pair back . my suggestion is this : order a full size up . not rocket science . . . . . . . my daughter does love them and they are very well made and pretty . i personally had the same size - up issue with a pair of crocs ( flip - flops ) and i ordered a full size up as it was . . . . . . 
this shoe looks great and is very comfy , but it runs small . order one size up if you can . i wear a size 11m , the largest size available , so the shoe did not fit me well . too bad they don ' t go up to a size 12 , because i would have definitely exchanged them for the bigger size . 
i ' m so glad i ordered these flip flops . they are the most comfortable flops i ' ve ever owned . no rubbing between my toes or on top of my foot . i wish i had discovered these sooner . they are very shock absorbent so the ' d be perfect for anyone with knee and or back issues . i will definitely purchase more of these in the future . 
the only reason i dont have these shoes anymore was because of my new puppy . they are fantastic ! made super well and so freaking comfortable . best ever ! 
reef flip flops are the most comfortable in the world . i wore a pair for the first time to sea world and walked around for hours with no pain or friction . the longer you wear them , the foam begins to conform to your foot . this particualr one is nice because it has thick padding . i ' vs gotten 10 years out of a pair before ! 
these are the most comfortable flip flops ever ! i like all reef flip flops , but for comfort and walkability , these are tops ! i can even hike in these . highly recommend . 
these reefs are so comfortable and true to size . the color is perfect . i love how they fit ! very durable , and will last a long time . i have owned others , and they last for years . i love the blue , so beautiful , yet ladylike . would recommend others to order these , they fit great ! 
does exactly what a flip flop is supposed to . very comfortable actually . seems to be good quality so far . . . i have had them for a month . 
super comfy , super cute ! after wearing these around for a little while , i ' ve decided that these reef flip flops are going to become a summer staple for me . love these ! i want more ! 
i was introduced to the reef & # 34 ; sandy & # 34 ; flip flops about 3 years ago , and i now wear these ( almost ) exclusively . i have driven several places to find these in my size . my husband went to macy ' s and asked for the brown ones . he was told they no longer make the brown . while he was telling me this , i was already into my amazon account , and had the shoes up on the screen . clicked & # 34 ; add to cart & # 34 ; , and in 3 . 5 seconds i had a pair on the way . in brown . in my size . in 2 days ( i ' m a prime customer ) . sweetened by the fact they were $ 11 . 00 cheaper than macy ' s . love , love , love these flip flops . love , love , love amazon ! ! ! 
i buy a new pair of these every year . i love them . they are comfortable and durable ! i highly recommend them . 
these sandals are comfy , stylish , a respectable brand , and affordable . i couldn ' t be happier with this sandal . i ' ve been wearing reefs for years and as long as they keep on making them , i ' ll keep on buying them . 
i don ' t wear flip flops because they hurt btwn my toes . my friend ordered a size 7 that was too small for her . i wear a size 6 so she brought them to me to try . i was skeptical . wow ! i just ordered myself a pair in a neutral color so i can wear them with everything . they are now my every day footwear for summer . 
these are very nice looking and the sole is fairly well cushioned , but the cloth straps over the top of the feet is scratchy and irritating . hopefully it ' ll smooth out a bit with use . these really do run just a little small - i usually take a 7 1 / 2 wide and the 8 fits fine . 
i ' ve only had these for a day but they are so comfortable ! i think these are the most comfortable flip flops i ' ve ever had . i usually wear an 8 . 5 and ordered a 9 . they are a bit short in the back so i think i could have had a 10 but i will still be able to wear these . 
i have about 60 pairs of shoes in my closet - these are by far my favorite . there is nothing like this pair of reefs . i ' ve bought them 3 times over the years . they last forever , are super comfortable - even for walking long distances , and don ' t get beat up at the beach . 
i normally wear size 7 , and i have wide feet ( d ) . i ordered this style ( sandy flip flop ) specifically , because many reviewers have mentioned these flip flips are wider than other styles from reef . it turned out to be very true - they are wide enough that my little toe rest comfortably on the rubber sole instead of hanging out . the stretchy straps also make them more comfortable to wear . however , i do find out after a short walk to the gym , the straps still hurt my feet and left red marks as some of the rubber straps did to my feet . that was disappointing . the most unforgivable thing about these flip flops is the sizing problem . the sole is indeed the size that i ordered , but because these straps are pushing my feet to the back , both my heels do not rest entirely on the sole , instead , they hang outside of the sole about 1 / 2 inch . the improper fit also causes pain at my achilles tendons . i would definitely recommend to order at least one size larger . i am not the only one who complains about the incorrect sizing . later on i found numerous reviews , based on this and other reef flip flops , point out the same problem - they are really one size too small . anyway , i am not that impressed with these flip flops , as they are neither comfortable or visually appealing . won ' t buy them again . 
my son was doing a report on vikings & needed a prop . this helmet fit fine . i liked that it was inexpensive so if something happened to it at school it wouldn ' t be a big loss . he got an & # 34 ; a & # 34 ; on his project & now we have something new to add to our halloween box . 
great prop for our photobooth ! it fits adult heads just fine and made everyone laugh . would also be good for a halloween costume . 
this is a favorite accessory around the house ! we use it for every party no matter what ! so very cool ! 
got this for my husband and he loves it ! it fits great . it was a little hard to wedge the horns in all the way but he finally did it and now they stay in perfectly . did not have to assemble the helmet like some mentioned - just had to stick the horns in . nice comfortable fit but very hot inside ! we may poke holes at the very top for ventilation if it gets too hot . 
guest love this hat for a photo booth . once the white horns are popped into place , they seemed to stay there . no problems . 
perfect helmet to complete my viking outfit - - - - it is a heavy plastic and is very comfortable to wear . the pictures were great , kind of made the outfit . 
we are a family that likes to laugh so we put on these kind of hats to lighten the mood and keep the stress at bay . 
i bought a bunch of these helmets for a viking / opera skit for my sister ' s birthday . they look great , with some awesome detail . they were pretty easy to assemble , although the horns can rotate some in their holes . the helmets are a good size , able to fit medium sized heads well . those of us with smaller heads needed to add some padding , and those of us with larger heads just wore it a little high . i gave it only fours stars because the edges on the bottom are rough and my brother complained that it hurt his ears . this hat would be perfect if they lined the inside with rubber or soft material . other than that , it was the most perfect viking hat i could find . on a note about the company i ordered from , fox martin corp . , they responded promptly and professionally to me about my concern regarding shipment time . the hats ( 6 adult viking helmets and 1 child viking helmet ) did arrive on time and in great condition . thank you to the company for responding personally to me , that was great customer service . : ) 
loved the boots but the extra wide was too wide and there were no boots available in a 1e only a 2e , so unfortunately i had to send them back . 
i ordered these for a friend who stands on his feet for work . he said he liked them . he seemed to be happy with them and they were recommended to him by co - workers . 
a real solid and comfortable boot great for work as they are not to heavy even good for the weekend hanging around 
my husband wears these boots all the time he loves them . they quit selling them in our area so i found them on amazon . this will be the place i look first next time . my kids tease him cause he even wears them with his shorts working in the yard . he is flat footed and has spurs , he says it keeps him from having pain . he loves them and it helps him so what else can i say . 
the size was perfect , the leather is soft , the boots feels very comfortable wearing . i put a thin coat of leather cream on them to enrich their beauty and that was it . i ' m very please with these boots . the price was reasonable . 
this shoe was purchased for my 95 year old mother who needed something that was of good quality and closed in . they were a bit tight for her ; therefore , i ordered the next half size larger . i was happy to see that it came in the next half size because the whole size would have been too big for her . i know that she will be happy with the larger size and will fit more comfortably . 
i have very swollen feet due to a heart condition . i thought these would be wide enough , but sometimes they ' re a little tight . i ' m hoping they ' ll stretch . otherwise , they are fine . color is great . 
due to a recent injury , and a very swollen foot , i ordered ww width . i was hoping to have something that i could get on my foot , since this will take a long time to heal . the slippers that came are actually more narrow than a regular width ! the box label says ww but they are far far from it . i am not impressed . beware ! 
but i find it hard to believe this is supposed narrow . i walk right out of it . i have to return them even though i love to color . 
these are a bit narrow so if you wear ' b ' width - get ' d ' f you don ' t like snug fitting slippers 
the shoes i bought were supposed to be the size i wear but , they are to long . the narrow size is ok but the shoe slides up and down on my heal making them very uncomfortable . i bought some insoles and heal gaurds and am able to wear them . the sole of the shoe was thinner than i expected also . again with the inserted soles i am able to wear them . hope others will fair better with theirs , although i think i will buy a cheaper pair next time maybe they will fit better . 
i like the looks , but they ' re too small . also there isn ' t much cushioning in the sole so not great for house slippers . i think the next size up will be too big so i ' m going to return them . 
fits perfectly using a ruler to measure heal to to and using your normal shoe width . very nice shoe for the price . a two inch heel would have been nice but this is a slipper . nice leather and well constructed . 
the slipper was very narrow in the front , crowding my toes and not at all comfortable . i ' m very disappointed ; for the price , it should have fit true to form . 
nice slippers , can be worn outside to sweep the porch and gather the paper . tend to make my feet hot . do give good support . 
the shoe fits fine , but i need shoes with rubber soles as i am handicapped . daniel green women ' s meg slipperi hope daniel green has a slipper that has a rubber sole . i ordered the product from amazon . 
i love this slipper and plan to buy another pair in a different color . they are very comfortable and have a great fit . 
love these slippers . they are attractive , comfortable and suit me just fine . this was the second time i purchased them . . and i will buy them again . 
this shoe seems to run small and i first got a 9 . 5 and exchanged for a 10 . 0 but disappointed that i didn ' t return for a 10 . 5 because it would have been more comfortable . 
i liked the color , style , and price , but the size was wrong . i usually wear an 8 1 / 2 , it was too small . the item itself was nice . 
these are nicely made and have a soft sole , which limits them to indoor wear . the leather is soft and i like the multi color metallic finish for a versatile look in a nice & # 34 ; around the house & # 34 ; slipper . the wedge gives height without sacrificing comfort . delivered ahead of time . 
this are nice looking bed slippers and you have to buy one size up for it to fit perfectly . i wear a size 10 shoe and the 11 slipper fits perfect . 
these are the only slippers my mil will wear . she took a half size larger in this style and although they are quite snug she says they ' ll stretch . i ' ll take her word for it ! 
these are working out well for my son . we ' ve had a lot of snow and he has been wearing them a lot to shovel the driveway and get around . they ' re warm and holding up well . 
very well constructed boot . these boots are warm and they keep your feet dry , a must for those of us who like to get off of the beaten path . i would recommend these boots to anyone looking or a quality made and well priced boot . 
iv ' e been weraing woverine boots for several years . i have a pair of of 6 & # 34 ; bulldozers that are over 6 years old and are finally getting to teh point where the soles are worn enough that the boots are nearing retirement . the other day one of the upper ( hook ) lacign points broke . i was heart - broken . . . these are my favorite boots . then i saw the fultons . so i decided to try them based on a number of reviews . thet arrived a day early ( kudos to the seller shoe station on that one ) ! i put them on and me feet fell in love immediately . my feet were tired from a day of work and they actualy felt better when i put these on . i walked around a store for a couple of hours adn had no issues . no break - in period ! ! ! 
size was spot on what i expected . super traction and good ankle support . very comfortable shoe . i buy my hikers extra wide so i can insert a gel sole and then change the gels on a regular basis . good hiking boots for a reasonable price . 
hubby and i have been together for over 16 years . he used to work in construction , and has experienced some injuries that make comfortable shoes as necessary as they are hard to find . the ball of his foot is very wide , and his heel is fairly narrow . he wears a size 12 eee . these are the first shoes he ' s been able to wear in complete comfort since we met ! he ' s tried everything , and we were just about to resign ourselves to the fact that he would never find comfortable shoes . the toe - box has plenty of room in the extra - wide width , the heel doesn ' t slip , the reinforced toe isn ' t heavy like a steel - toe , and the shank in the arch is sufficient for all the shoveling he does . and he doesn ' t take them off as soon as we get home at the end of the day . he walks a lot , several miles with the dogs twice a day , and the first couple of days he wore them , he came in looking for them , forgetting that he had them on . the fit is perfect and the boot is very light , compared to work - boots . i didn ' t know i was holding such feelings about his shoes , but when someone you love is never comfortable and not likely to be for a long time , i guess you just live with it . he was so happy and amazed by the comfort of these hikers , i nearly cried with relief . so , yes , we ' d buy them again , and will get wolverines for him from now on . 
i have always been a big fan of bulova watches and this one is my favorite every day watch . it is just the right size and the face is classic . i took it to a local jeweler for sizing , i needed two links added for my wrist , plus i like it a little loose . anyway , he was surprised that i paid $ 200 . 00 less than his retail for the same watch . love it , love it ! 
this wa s a gift to a special person in my life . she loved it . it took over a week to get it but it was worth it . 
i love this watch . i treated myself to it and i ' m happy that i did . bulova is great quality . i highly recommend it . 
i absolutely love this watch . i find myself admiring it on my wrist all the time ! i have a very small wrist , so was afraid it might be too big on me , but it ' s perfect ; not too big and very stylish . love the little bit of bling . i ' ve only had it for a little over 2 months , so will check back if have any problems . so far , though , fabulous ! 
this is a beautiful watch ! the picture here does not do it justice ! i have been coming back to this watch for months watching the price . i finally bit the bullet and purchased it , ( on sale ! ! ! ) . i am so glad i bought it , it is truly beautiful ! ! ! not too big , not too small , just right . 
the watch is beautiful and i loved it . i wore it sparingly so it would stay nice , using an older watch for everyday use . in spite of that 10 months after i got it it no longer works and the metal that surrounds the date window has fallen off and is loose in the case . i think there are some quality issues at bulova . be careful . 
great watch . i was concerned about ordering a watch online , but it turned out perfect . the clasp is a little tricky . it ' s called a " hidden clasp " so make sure you show the user how it works before they damage the watch . the price on amazon was amazing compared to the local retail stores . highly recommend . 
this bulova # 96r19 is really beautiful in person and can be dressed up or down and the chronograph adds style and personality . the watch does not look cheap and the face is not too large even for my small wrist . it is a tad bigger than the traditional woman ' ' s watch but it still is smaller than the larger faces now in style . i actually chose the bulova 96r19 first after seeing it in a department store but being the researcher that i am , i discovered the bulova 96r134 model and i liked it more for the slightly larger bezel , shaded gray face and additional diamonds , especially for the same price . i have added pictures of this watch on my 6 " wrist ( probably smaller than the average ladies ' wrist size ) and some comparison pictures next to the bulova 96r134 . for a watch in this price range , you cannot go wrong with this bulova . i am very happy with choosing this brand and will buy more in the future . 
i have been pricing this watch in retail stores for over a year . last year it was $ 325 . oo and this year it was going for $ 525 . 00 . i was able to get if on amazon for almost half the price and it is the exact watch . love , love , love it ! 
fit great look great ! i like the price ! i really like the style ! good price ! ! ! there light and a great color 
stride rite , what more can you say for childrens footwear ? received days sooner than expected , nice product to get the little guy out of socks for the balance of his summer break , just not big on going into stores these days , very low tolerance for the rudeness of people , thank god for amazon . com . 
perfect for my boys ! nice dressy sandals with a little toe protection . they are soft and pliable . and no blisters ! 
i bought these for my 2 & 1 / 2 year old son and he loves them and wants to wear them everywhere . . . even around the house . i had bought a pair of the same sandals when he was littler but he could not appreciate them as much then . i like the ruggedness of the sandal which is perfect for a child who is outdoors a lot . they seem to be quite comfortable and do not rub on his achilles tendon like some sandals can . i think they are well designed for toddlers and the consequent wear and tear . i would definitely buy these again when he outgrows the current pair . they seem to fit true to size and don ' t appear to be too heavy for him . 
i love stride rite , and this is a nice sturdy shoe for my very active toddler . it fits his foot perfectly . 
bought these for my grandson . true to size . very nice quality and he loves them . he wears them all the time . 
my son is 1 . 5 years old with a huge foot . i buy most of his shoes at the stride rite store in town so i can have his foot measured . he had just been fitted for an 8w sneaker in the store when i spied these online . after reading the reviews , i ordered a 1 / 2 size up . they fit well and are comfortable for him to spend the day in . i really like that even as a sandle they are basically closed toe since he is forever running into things or dropping toys on his feet . they are also nice enough that he can wear them to church on sundays . will definitely be buying this style again next summer . 
comfortable . easy for him to put on by himself . great traction at the bottom . 1 took off 1 start because my son destroyed the front of the shoe within a month . i was expecting better quality from stride rite , but maybe he was just really hard on it so i am giving them the benefit of the doubt . 
i ordered these shoes not because they looked all that great , but because ( 1 ) they were cheap , ( 2 ) the beautiful shoes i ' d ordered for my daughter for starting school were too big , ( 3 ) i remember from my own childhood that stride rite shoes are supposed to be high quality , ( 4 ) i could get them shipped overnight for $ 3 . 99 with my amazon prime , and ( 5 ) i figured if nothing else , since they were so cheap , i could let my daughter draw on them to achieve that stamp of coolness kids so covet . as it turned out , these are quite a sharp - looking pair of shoes , and they are indeed well made . my daughter reports that they are very comfortable , and , shock of all shocks , her friends think they ' re cool . she ' s thrilled . what started out as an emergency backup pair is now her favorite pair to wear . i ' m not sure i ' d pay full price for these ( i ' m cheap ) , but the clearance price is a fantastic bargain . i plan to buy more . 
i love the stride rite shoes quality , i bought this for my son as part of his uniform for school , i really like these shoes they go with everything and always the stride rite shoes are very comfortable for him , he loves this shoes and since i received them he doesn ' t take them off . 
these shoes are for school uniform . my grandson ' s feef are extra wide and it is difficult to buy wide shoes for a 4 year old . these worked really well this year . may buy another pair this year . 
stride rite ' s austin athletic shoe is a well made and versatile shoe . the quality of the leather is nice , and the stitching is strong throughout the shoe . it has a heavy dute sole that should wear well for quite a while , even for an active child . the shoe itself is heavy , not like an ultra light sneaker ( which most kids probably don ' t wear anyway ) . note - there is little padding on the inside of the shoe , which may or may not make a difference depending on your child ' s foot . this shoe comes in w & xw sizes . another great thing about this shoe is that it ' s gender neutral , so a boy or girl could wear it . i love stride rite ' s quality and versatility in the austin athletic shoe . i won ' t buy this style again , because honestly , i ordered one in every size . with the sales / discounts it was about $ 13 per pair , and i can easily sell used pairs for this much at the consignment shop . 
i ' ve been buying this style for my son for 4 years . we ' ve had them in both white and black and just love the quality and fit . highly recommend ! 
it works better than expected . one must keep in mind that it is a polishing cloth and not a substitute for a liquid or cream cleaner . 
i had a ton of tarnished silver jewelry lying around and new they needed to be cleaned . this did the job just as expected and all is like new . 
i hate polishing jewelry but this makes it much easier . no muss , no fuss , no messy creams . my sister got me one like this with a jewelry case for a birthday about 10 years ago and i didn ' t need another one until now . 
if you are thinking on getting few of these - no needthis one is big enough that you can make few of normal sized cloths without any problems and guess what - they all work good : - ) 
i used this with blitz jewelry cleaner and the ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machine , and it worked fantasticly ! super simple yet so effective ! 
this polishing cloth works exceptionally . after using jewelers rouge one wipe with this cloth produces amazing polish finish . . . . highly recommended ! 
mine does not say sabrina . . . it says world . this always makes me wonder if i got the right thing . i prefer to get that which is advertized . 
my husbands ring seemed to be ruined after spending time in a hot tub on a cruise . he has had this ring for about 10 years and always wears it . we are not sure but it might be silver . it has turned a deep charcoal . he used this cloth and it came up bright and shiny again . i was sure the ring was ruined but the cloth did a great job . he did work on it a while though , but well worth the effort . 
i liked how this cloth came with a cover to protect and store . i will buy again once i need to replace . i am very satisfied . 
i liked the product description of this large jewelry cleaning cloth , and the product is exactly as described . i use it to clean all of my sterling silver jewelry , and it works very well . 
this thing works great on my sterling silver badge ! used to use a paste and a microfiber cloth but it would leave very small scratches . this works great especially for the price . 
never bought a jewelry cloth . this one , as far as i can tell , is the ferrari of jewel cloths . i use it in combination with my professional grade sonic jewelry cleaning machine . the result of the dual cleaning process is stunning . the two step cloth cleaning is excellent and for the price plus prime , a no - brainer . 
it works well . i also bought a silver cleaning liquid . this cloth makes the silver very shiny . the liquid bath only makes it clean . this is great for my silver bracelets and cufflinks . 
this item is just as described . works perfectly fine and it ' s huge . excellent for the price and serves it ' s purpose perfectly fine . 
works as described and seems like it will serve many repeated uses over time . it ' s replacing a smaller one i have had for many years . larger size good for large jewelry and other items which need polishing such as statues , dinnerware , trays , and many other items in brass , gold , silver ( sterling ) . 
i do not recommend . silver foam and creams work much better than this polishing cloth . 
this cloth is fantastic to polish up my jewelry after i have cleaned it . workable great on my new and antique jewelry items . 
cleaned my silver as advertise . . but i should have ordered smaller size so easy to keep and cost savings as will discard as utilized . . but anyway works well in cleaning my tarnished silver . . 
nice cloths , but not needed . turns out just regular rags worked just fine . i regretted the purchase . . . size is okay though . 
nice size ! i enjoy wearing silver jewelry , and a polishing cloth is a must - have . it can be used for other metals also , of course , and for silver tableware . 
i love this cloth ! ! ! ! the very first time i used it on some sterling silver jewelry , it made them shine as if brand new . i used it in conjunction with a silver polish i bought at the same time and both are perfect ! 
didnt like it as much as the liquid cleaner scrub scrub scrub and still didnt look to hot 
great cloth to use to clean my ring . 
i bought this and as soon as i opened i used it to clean my very tarnished silver necklace and charm , wow ! ! ! ! it took about 3 seconds to remove all the black , ugly layer , then i polished with the soft side of the cloth and it was shinny as new . this is amazing , i always hated having to use those stinky , slimy and ugly cleaners before , so this is just perfect if you want a clean , quick , mess - free product to clean your jewelry . so far i have tried it only on silver and it has been amazing , but i haven ' t tried it on other materials yet . once i ' m done with this cloth i ' ll buy again and again , because it ' s exactly what i needed : a mess - free , efficient , quick cleaning product that gets rid of the ugliness in seconds . yes , i love this ! ! ! ! . 
worth it ' s weight in silver ! the best polishing cloth for my silver jewelry ever and you could not find it more reasonably priced ! 
this cloth works so well . every piece of jewelry that i clean comes out sparkling . i just get the urge to clean and clean . 
purchased for my church . the cloth works well keeping the altar sets polished . i can recommend this product for polishing metal items . 
durable , and they function just as advertized . i use these for the silver rings on my bagpipes , and the tarnish comes right off . 
i used this along with wright ' s silver cream , and my trumpet looks great . i was really surprised how well just this rag takes off tarnish . the silver cream wasn ' t 100 % necessary , but it does help get some of the tougher spots cleaned up . 
i have one of these , this large , but dirty as can be and its over 24 years old . buy a few , clean someone ' s ring or watch , and give it to them as a gift . many people have no idea what a jewelers cloth is . better than a polish or something not dry ! 
i originally got it to clean up a bronze torc that i have and wear regularly , which slowly tarnishes ( and darkens ) the finish . i wasn ' t even sure it would work , but from all that i read , i was fairly sure that it at least wouldn ' t damage it or scratch it up . well , it not only worked , it worked fast and very well ! it only took me about three minutes to have the torc shining like new again ; very impressed ! i went on to shine up a few pairs of silver earrings and rings that were in need , and again , quick , easy and beautiful ! the best part is that there is no mess like there is with the liquid cleaners , and the cleaning cloth is stitched to the polishing cloth so you always have them together . 
nothing remarkable . the white inner cloth does clean a bit better when damp ( not wet ) and the outer blue one shines things up nicely . it states not to use it with pearls or 14kt gold or higher as it will scratch . i don ' t know if it is just a disclaimer to protect themselves , but i ' m not going to take the chance ! 
i use this to clean my watches and rings and its amazing how much grime it removes and has my jewelry looking like new ! 
this polishing cloth is great . it ' s stored with my sterling silver jewelry so i can give whatever piece i want to wear a quick wipe before putting it on . a couple of the polishing clothes i ' ve had in the past had an unpleasant odor to them but this one doesn ' t seem to have any odor at all . very pleased and will be ordering a few more just to have on hand . 
i like to keep my class ring nice and shiny by using this polishing cloth about once a week . it only takes me a couple of minutes , and the ring always looks brand new . i get about two years worth of use before having to replace it . 
i needed a polishing cloth for my silver cufflinks and certain other jewelry . this cloth did the job . you polish the jewelry with the chemically - impregnated side , and then buff it with the other side . simple , effective , and elegant . rjb . 
i had my order sent to my work address , as i always have . however , this time the receptionist boxed it and forgot about it . i contacted the company , thinking it had been lost in the mail . they graciously sent another . . . the same day my order appeared at work . the replacement was sent soon after i notified them it had not been received . . . so , i want all to know that they were wonderful to work with . . . problem was on my end ! 
i could of polish my jewelry with a wash cloth and get better results then this expensive cloth . i do not recommend this ! 
primary use to polish silver jewelry . works great , makes job quick and easy . no messy chemicals to work about , polishing is completed using one side of the cloth and shiring is completed using the other side . good investment ! 
this cloth worked very well without scratching the surfaces of my silver . much , much easier than the creams and pastes . cream didn ' t work as well as this cloth did . from now on this is what i use . 
this silver polishing cloth is more than just a cloth , it has an outter and an inner cloth and the inner has most of the chemical and does the job ! the other is used to polish after you have cleaned . i ' m getting a couple more and giving one to my mom . 
this cloth performs as described . we particularly like the size so we are not struggling to polish larger pieces . we would recommend this cloth to family and friends . 
love the size . it cleans just fine . wish didn ' t have to clean jewelry but this cloth helps . that about sums it up . 
i am a fanatic about keeping my jewelry clean . i find this cloth does a wonderful job and does it very easily . it is very convenient to use also . 
this is the best polishing cloth to use for silver , gold and other metals . . . . . easy to use with excellent results . . . . good buy 
this is the second review i made on these slippers . i also rated them about two ( or three ) years ago . these are the best slippers i have ever owned . i live in these when i am not at work both inside and out . they are comfortable , durable and look great ! 
i bought this for my father , who has bigfoot status sized feet lol , we usually have difficulty finding shoes that will fit him in the width . but these were amazing . he put them on and absolutely loved it ! the fit was perfect and they were very soft on the inside . worth the buy , and they actually withstand quite a bit of wear had them for almost a year now and they still are holding up pretty good for him and he uses these as his main shoes : ) 
i bought these slippers for my father to wear as shoes in his assisted living facility . i love them so much that i bought another pair the following christmas . i would buy them again when these wear out . they are comfortable and have good tread which is important for my father as he is a fall risk . not bad for a man of 93 ! ! 1 
i have been home bound for a month post surgery and have worn these slippers the entire time . being in february 2014 it has been a brutally cold month , and these slippers handle any and all breezes with ease . these do have memory foam in them , but isn ' t their best feature , although comfy . the best feature of these are the ingress and egress factor , absolutely stunning ! these can literally be jumped into , making these perfect for those that are mobility limited . have not tried to clean these yet , however i do not see that being a stumbling block , they aren ' t waterproof but have been able to handle the light duty snow i have as well . 
very comfortable . only problem was the label where my heel came down on . simple fix - i removed the label ! 
these slippers have a long hard tag on the inside from the heel forward a couple of inches , i ' d guess . why do you make a comfy soft fleece - lined slipper and sew in a very large stiff label to stick the bottom of the wearer ' s feet ? not a comfy design . i had to very carefully pull the incredibly thick , tight stitching to pull the tag out of each slipper ( they were very well attached ) before my husband was happy with these . i wish the manufacturer would lose the tag . great slippers otherwise though . would probably purchase again despite the tag . 
first reaction is it is a good slipper , warm and comfortable . from past experience i get slippers a bit smaller than my regular shoe size because i ' ve never had a slipper that didn ' t stretch and in a short time fit loosely . this slipper fits like expected , except maybe a bit more narrow than expected . i can ' t seem to keep the laces tied . no problems with quality so far , i will update if that changes . 
these slippers are not terry lined , they are fleece lined . i have purchased them before for my husband and wanted fleece , so when the picture looked like fleece inside i took a chance and it was . he has worn a pair of these for the past 15 years or so . i keep replacing them with new ones . he loves them . they have a nice sole and cushioned inside . 
we bought these for the boys this christmas and they just love them . in fact , you can ' t get them off their feet ! they are so warm , cushioned nicely , and they ' re not that cheapo nasty slipper that keeps your feel cold all winter . these guys have some umph to them , and the sole is pretty hard . hard enough to get the mail without getting your feet soaked . guess it pays to up the anty when you are buying slippers . the suede is easily cleaned - just brush it off and go . can ' t say enough good about these - just glad i finally found a pair that was worth the money . i ' ll buy more when these wear out . highly recommend ! 
i purchased these for my husband for christmas . i checked locally for a good pair , and couldn ' t believe the price for this quality shoe . so as always , i went to amazon and he loves them . 
these are well made and are very comfortable , however just a tad small . i usually wear a size twelve and have plenty of toe room . if i do not wear socks they are fine , however a bit snug with socks on . these are quality slippers and look great and you can buy by size instead of the s , med . , or lg . like so many other brands . i probably would order a half size larger next time . i would recommend this brand for someone looking for a quality product . 
i like these slippers very much to wear around the house and they are warm and comfortable in the winter . high recommend . 
these are very nice , they look great and feel terrific , very comfortable . best slippers i ' ve ever had . heavy leather , solid soles , my feet feel well - protected from the vicissitudes of walking around my house . 
these slippers are very nice looking . they also help keep my feet warm . paying a little extra pays off . the only reason i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because the size was off . my slippers are marked what i ordered but must be at least one size too big . on occasion one of the slippers come off my foot while going up the steps . i can do an adjustment with the raw hide laces . overall i would buy them again and recommend them to my friends . 
i purchased these for my son in - law for christmas and he really loves them and he even wore them to the hospital to vist a friends mom since they have outdoor soles - wanted to try them out - since they were so comfortable 
i bought this slipper on a website 2 years ago when i was looking for a replacement to another mail order company ' s slippers that fell apart on me . these have held up well for 2 years and just started to tear around the toes and sole . amazon was easy to order from and the slippers are exactly what i wanted ( matched old slippers ) . they are a bit snug when you first put them on , but that leaves room for a break in , then they are warm and comfortable . also , the soles on my original pair have stayed intact - on cheaper slippers they usually wear through in weak spots . my feet are hard on shoes and these slippers held up well - just tighten the leather straps as they stretch out over the years . 
i ordered a 13 m which was way too small so i am returning them and will be getting a 14 3e . when they arrive i will be updating this post . 
i purchased these for my husband to replace his much worn acorn sheepskin slippers . he was pleased with these , they fit well and he felt llike they were well constructed . we will purchase again if they are available . 
this was a gift for an elderly person and they indicated it was a very good house shoe . 
i bought these slippers for my husband and he loves them . size is perfect fit , quality is really good , much better than many similar products in store for much bigger price . 
bought for my husband for xmas . he loved them . warm and cozy . and he likes that he can wear outside . the sole is nice enough you could wear them out and about if wanted . very nice quality 
my husband finds the slippers very comfortable and of good quality . he will definitely buy them in the future . thank you for a good product and good service . 
very well made and built to last . they were a little tight when i first got them but stretched enough to be very comfortable . i will purchase another pair if and when these wear out . 
i ' ve been ordering these slippers for the past several years now . they are very comfortable and the fit is perfect . they do wear out each year as i wear them a lot , but i kind of expect that . very good product . 
i bought these for my late husband who normally wore a 15 and these were too big , so i think the sizing is right on . i had to return them since they did not fit him . they seem to be well made and will get a work out with the average weekender to loaf around in . 
great shoe that has a comfortable fit . it is well made and looks very nice . i bought them for my 85 year old dad and he said they get an " a + " . 
excellent quality slipper . my size is 10 1 / 2 eee , i ordered the 10 eee and it was too small . so if you are a half size or have wider feet i recommend buying the next size larger . 
these slippers fit perfect and feel great ! i love the fact that i can walk outside and my feet stay dry and warm . they are extremely well made and attractive . they came on time and arrived in great condition . i would recommend these to anyone . 
my son lives in these shoes . he just keeps saying , " these shoes are so comfortable . " 
as soon as i removed these from the box i knew i would love them . they look great and feel even better . i was surprised at how comfortable they were . i wear a size 14 and they seem a little snug , but not painful or uncomfortable . if you have problems with feeling constricted i would suggest going up 1 / 2 size or full size if possible . 
was pleased at the quality and comfort ( according to my husband ) of these slippers . would recommend these slippers . 
originally , i ordered a size 13 , but it was way too small . nicely , amazon replaced them with size 14 ' s as it wasn ' t my fault that the slippers are undersized . the new ones fit fine and were quite comfy . after i wore them for about 2 months , i noticed a gap along the seam formed by the top and the sides of one of the slippers . the gap was caused by the leather ripping apart where the lacing goes . the gap continued to spread . then the second slipper did the same . from the past reviews , it looks like its hit - or - miss whether you get a good pair or not . definitely a miss for me . 
my husband tells me they are warm and comfortable . ordered them as a christmas gift , they arrived on time and in good shape . i would buy from this merchant again . 
these slippers have been around for quite a while now . they ' re comfortable , and have held up extremely well . they look nice too . 
these slippers fit and feel terrific . as important as fit and feel are , durability certainly ranks right up there . these slippers are of excellent quality and made of tough , durable materials . my second pair ( and not the last ) , the first pair lasted for nearly 4 years and the only reason they " gave up " is that i walked through the soles ( outside ) . as these are " slippers , " they performed well above their intended role . you can pay more for slippers but it is unlikely you will find better at any price . 
after over a year of use and abuse , it is still holding up well . i have 3 pairs and forget to take them off when i go outside and they have been wet , but still recover . i ' ll buy more if available . 
i bought these slippers for a family member with flat feet . finding slippers that are wide enough is always a problem . . . especially well made ones . these are very handsome slippers and seem to be well made . the heel is a little loose for him , but that is an ongoing problem with any slip on that is wide enough at the head of the shoe . i would definitely recommend these slippers . 
this is my 4th pair of these slippers . i always have 1 pair stored away still - in - box for when the current pair wears out . ( just in case they discontinue making them ) and it takes a lot of wear to wear out ! they feel like a comfy slipper , but wear like a shoe . for the first few days , the fluffy interior is a bit tight . but that soon compresses and then they feel great . i wish i could find a pair of shoes that felt as good . 
i bought these for my 13 year old grandson . he was excited that he had slippers that fit his size 14 feet . 
these slippers meet my needs very well . a previous pair of slippers i owned had a very gummy sole that didn ' t slip but picked up dirt like a magnet . when they got damp they would leave foot prints every where . these l . b . evans have a flexible rubber sole that doesn ' t pick up everythig it touches . i ' m very happy with them . they are well built . 
warm , soft and easy to put on . my husband loves them and they keep his feet warm when our floors are freezing ! 
my husband loves these and is hard on his slipper , ie wears outside , etc . and these are handling the extra wear and tear . these are attractive and comfortable and were true to size . he loves ' um 
i ' m a c width . wanted something with some level of support / arch and not too wide . this provided neither . returned and went back to llbean . 
pretty good slippers , and the outdoor sole works very well . you can definitely get away with occasionally wearing these outside in the snow to get your morning paper . the lining is a synthetic material , so you should realize that daily wearing with no socks will lead to bacteria growth and odors . my next pair of slippers is definitely going to be a real lambskin slipper with real wool inside , as real wool naturally fights bacteria and odors . 
these are very nice quality house slippers , and nice looking too . my husband was preparing for surgery and a stay in the hospital and asked for a pair of good quality house slippers ; i decided on these . in over a years time of wearing them every single night , they just now are showing some wear and tear . i ' ve ordered this 2nd pair as a christmas gift . 
got these for my dad for christmas . he said they fit perfectly and he loves them . great for wearing out to the barn to keep his toes warm without having to bother with shoes . 
got these for my birthday . they are very true to size and roomy enough for a pair of warm socks . i would order your shoe size . i have only had them for a month but they are my best friends , especially in the morning when i have to walk outside to get the paper . i would recommend these to anyone who wants more than a fleecy sock - type slipper . 
was tight the first day and right the second . the quality seems good . i am comparing them to the $ 12 version i bought at costco . we ' ll see . so far no difference in warmth , fit etc . just costco is man made and this is not . but for 8x the price i wonder if these are worth it . 
i have purchased so many pairs of slippers in the last year . all of them had major flaws . size , fit , comfort , qualitythese slippers fit good . i ' m a 13 they are 14 so order a little big . soft comfortable . stylish , i dont care about that . i will buy these again & again 
first , unlike some other slippers these are quite true to size , i wear a size 14 shoe ( although my last dearfoam slippers were a 13 and fit fine ) i ordered these slippers in a 14m and they fit just fine . the suede leather is quite nice and the footbed is very cushiony . nice thick bottom ( which does add to the weight of the slipper ) but should work good for not only the house but trips to the mailbox or garage . btw for whatever reason when i ordered mine they were $ 36 which was about the max i wanted to spend for slippers but when going back to write this review i see they are now $ 44 . . . . . doubt i would have ordered them if that was the case , but again nice slippers . 4 - 20 - 2013 update : the more i use these slippers the more i like them . very comfortable and sole is usable even outdoors . i would order again without hesitation ! 1 - 5 - 2014 update : still really liking these slippers , i like how the bottom is rather smooth and don ' t pickup or hold crud from say the garage or outside , they are wearing very well with no issues . 
excellent quality . great gift for my brother . . . . . . . . . . he thinks they ' re as good as shoes . fast shipping time . bought a second pair for another gift . 
my son in law requested house shoes for christmas . these shoes were a big hit . he wears them a lot . theyare sturdy enough to wear outside too . 
these run small for the size . i ordered " eee " because i wanted them on the roomy side . they are on the tight side . also i will need to cut off a piece of material ( leather or suede whatever ) that is extending through the inside cushioning material . i will cut the hard material off and glue a couple of cotton balls in its place . i would buy again but a larger size , i purchased 11 eee . 
this one is great . it fits as expected , and warm . the soles are such where you can wear outside , in the garage , anywhere you would wear a shoe . yet the comfort of a slipper . my son loves these . 
these slippers make a fantastic gift . when i bought them to replace a loved - one ' s worn out pair , i received lots of praise and unsolicited compliments on how comfortable and great they feel on your feet . indeed . i wish i had bought a pair for myself , but my current pair are still in ok condition . maybe someday . 
without a doubt the best house slippers i have ever purchased in my 85 plus years . they are a great fit and even greater quality . i would heartily endorse this product and will buy again and again . they feel really great and look great ! these are the first mail order slippers that have been so great right out of the box . after wearing for a few hours , they get more and more comfortable . 
even though the box was crushed when it arrived the shoes were still in good order . they are well made , all stitches are correct and no apparent manufacturing defect . i then attempted to get them on . even though i ordered a eee i could not get my foot in the slipper . back they go ! 
they fit as expected and they are cofortable to wear . i like that the bottoms / soles are easy to clean . i can walk out side with these and not worry about them . 
really nothing to write negative . very comfortable right out of the box . the arch support is more like a good running shoe as well as the sole . i like the color and they are not too heavy . very nice house shoes , but may be a little too warm and cozy for summer ! 
i have a terrible back . finding quality , warm slippers , that don ' t require me to bend over to put on ? ? a god send . comfy , warm , great soles to boot . love them . 
comfy slippers but not the bee ' s knees . they do run small ; my size 9 . 5 foot is still searching for some more room in the size 10 slippers i bought . i ' m sure it will stretch in time with wear . oddly , these are made in that place that starts with the letter " c " and ends with an " a " ( not california ) . had i known , i would have spent a few more $ $ $ to buy from a us source . one annoying aspect is an extremely poorly placed tag on the inside of the shoe , at the instep ( where the elastic band is on the side ) that rubs . again , i imagine the discomfort will lessen over time with wear . i view these as slippers , and would not wear these outside . perhaps to fetch the newspaper or the mail in my robe , but not when i leave the house . unless i want the absent - minded look . . . i am keeping them , but there have to be better and more comfortable choices than these . 
my first pair of these were bought by my lovely wife for me as a gift . after two years ( being the only foot covering i ' ve worn around the house ) of constant wear , they are getting too ratty to go to the store in : ) so i had to get a second pair . am still using the first pair when out in the garage , etc . they fit a touch snug for the first week or so , but then conform to your feet , so don ' t buy them loose ! i wear a 12eeee ( new balance ) , and the 12eee in this slipper works great ! btw - thank god for amazon , and the ' order history ' - it makes repeat buys much easier when you can ' t read the tag any longer ! 
my husband loves his slippers . they are warm . they are well made . they are true to size . glad i found them . they were a very good price for the quality . 
size 14 slippers are hard to find . my husband absolutely loves them . great quality and beautiful . the fit is true to size . 
way to small , could not get them on with a shoe horn . that being said they are a very good . , quality shoe / slipper . i am returning and will find a larger size . 
the only thing they could do to make these better is put a more textured gripping sole on them , to prevent slipping on carpeted stairs . they still have much better soles for traction than any of the other slippers i looked at - they ' re not completely smooth and hard plastic , like the others on the market . they are well made and warm . the extra wides really are extra wide , so the sizing is accurate - you don ' t have to buy a size larger and have extra space in the toe . 8 3e really does fit a size 8 , wide . 
i love these l . b . evans men ' s klondike slippers . they fit well & are well made . the soles are made of thick rubber & the interior material seems to be holding up very well ! 
no fault of the company , bought them for my brother with feet issues and even went a size larger but that did not help him . overall they look and felt like a well made shoe and would have loved them to fit him 
getting slippers that fit is somewhat difficult . . . . too small and they pinch and are hard to get on and off . . . too large and they are too loose on your feet . i measured my foot and luckily must have done it right , so they fit wonderfully . very warm , in fact maybe , if anything , a little too warm . but overall very satisfactory . and , the price is not too high for my wallet ! ! ! 
these slippers are warm , comfortable , and sturdy . you can walk around your yard in them . they do not scuff easily . they look nice . they do not get stinky if you happen to sweat in them ( so far ) . you will not notice you have them on . they fit well - - not tight or too loose , but just snug enough to slip them on and off easily . i bought a size . 5 up from what i would in sneakers . they feel perfect with a good thick sock . 
i had these wings out of the package for about 10 seconds before they started falling apart . talk about cheaply made ! awful product worth about 1 $ . don ' t bother with these . 
my daughter for a holiday costume urgently need wings . we bought these on amazon . for this price , normal quality , they are tough and do not hear and feathers . she still wears them sometimes at home . slightly yellowed with time 
i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter ' s halloween costume . they are not large wings , but they are still a good size for my daughter . they are slightly visible from the front and do not get in the way of her arm movement . 
our daughter need these for a school play . the feathers are in perfect condition and have held up really well . 
wonderful angel wings for the christmas program . fit my 6 year old daughter perfectly . be advised that maribou fluff comes off pretty easily , but the big feathers are pretty durable . 
i had a different vision in mind for decorations , this christmas . the theme i had in mind was " touched by an angel " - and i needed a pair of cheap wings to put up on the door ( instead of the usual wreaths ) . . . so , i picked up one , right from here on amazon and i was happy that i got it in just a couple of days . the end result was that i had an amazing - looking door , while the wings are still in good shape for me to use them again later . . . 
another that is pretty small . looks bigger in picture than it really is . i had originally hoped to use it for my daughter as a prop in a photo op but it is for an infant . it ' ll work for infants but not for older children . 
these wings were a gift and they not only sent them quickly but they were exactly as pictured ! they made someone ' s halloween . thank you ! 
i can ' t stress on the quality you get for ten bucks for this gun . plus , it is made in italy . when you see the gun you can see visually that it is well made and not cheap . once you hold it you will be amazed by how well it feels in your hand and how well it shoots . i bought this for my son and he likes it but i am sure he doesn ' t appreciate it as much as i do . the revolver that holds the ammo doesn ' t pop off which is a bummer but helps in having less moving parts thus making this toy last longer with kids . it has a little door on the right that you slide and insert ammo . you then turn the cylinder and do the same thing 7 more times . when you shoot it you don ' t just shoot 8 straight times . you have to cock the hammer back each time you wanna shoot . this gun is super fun . 
this toy is very accurate . i shot a fly that was 4ft away and the bullets are soft enough that it didn ' t kill the fly . 
wow great toy this company is a very fast shipper also durable , great looking gun shoots pretty good too i bought the soft bullets also because the gun does not come with ammo great to shoot indoors 
i bought two of these , one for me and the other for my little brother . they ' re pretty cool , have a working barrel and hammer . you can also shoot each other without protection ( except eye , always use eye protection ! ) and it doesn ' t hurt or sting but its enough force to know you got hit . be sure to buy ammo for it because it doesn ' t come with any . its a good buy 
realistic and sturdy . my son loved this gun ; you do have to buy caps or whatever it uses to go with the gun , but that ' s no big deal . 
this is probably the best toy i ' ve ever bought , and i didn ' t even really use it ! the gun does not come with any shots so buy a pack or two with your order . i knew this when i placed my order and didn ' t get any shots because i had different plans for it . the hammer pulls down just like you ' d want it to and rotates the barrel to load another shot . the whole this has a few fake plastic screws on it but most of the parts are actually just fused together in production with the exception of the handle , plastic painted like wood , which has a single screw . since i didn ' t get any shots i can ' t say much about the range or accuracy of the gun . what i used mine for was a costume prop . first i unscrewed the handle and popped it off , then using a dremel tool i carefully separated the two halves of the butt of the gun and gently pried the two apart . the inner workings are actually a little complex for a cute kid ' s toy and i was impressed . after opening it i gutted some parts and installed a flag that would pop out the end and say " bang ! " as part of my joker costume . the gun put back together really well and now i have a fun prop on my shelf until i wish to wear my costume again . the orange tip does come out easily if you open it up , but once closed again it wont budge . i do not recommend removing the tip if you ' re going to have this thing outside of a display . i ' m thinking about getting another , this time with some shots to shoot at my house mates . 
seriously , what ' s not to love about a toy 45 ? i love this little toy . it doesn ' t come with ammo , and i recommend you buying a lot of them because the ammo is small and easily lost . make sure you put the ammo at the very beginning of the barrel when you load it or it wont come out . if done right , this gun can be great fun for the family . 
all i prefer to where is black baseball caps with no logo , hard to find without being charged as much as a cap with a logo . a little slow to ship , but the wait was worth it . 
i have lots of hats with glitter and colorful trim , but really needed a basic black one for those bad - hair days when i have to run out to the store for some little nothing that seems important at the time . : - ) i wanted black because it goes with more , so when i saw this " cheapie " at amazon , i grabbed it up ! for this low price i expected it would be poorly constructed , so i ' m very pleased that it ' s sturdy , well - made and of good material . woo - hoo . . . for once i got a real bargain . i tip my cap to the maker of this product . highly recommended . reviewed by betty dravis , october 30 , 2010author of " dream reachers " ( with chase von ) and other books 
at first a tad suspicious of what the quality the product would be even after reading the reviews . i was very surprised by the packaging , delivery speed , considering the christmas holidays and quality of this product . i fully inspected the cap upon delivery and was surprised at the quality of the construction , sewing and the comfortable fit due to the ease of the velcro type adjustment strap in the back . i will be using this cap to attach a military patch and a couple of insignia pins which i believe will look outstanding . i highly recommend this company and look forward to doing additional business with them in the future . 
i needed a plain black cap for work so i ordered two of these . i was amazed by the quality of the caps when they arrived . great value ! 
i bought this cap for my husband two years ago and it is still one of his favorites . it is roomy and not tight fitting . very generously made . 
nice plain functional baseball cap , perfect for sunny days or to shield my glasses from rain . liked it so much , i bought a second one ! 
this hat is a gift for my grand child , have not given it to her as of yet . i did sew the black skull on itvery hard material for sewing decades onto . 
no so bad . the fit is okay . material is standard but good . can ' t beat the price for what you get . 
great ! i love them ! so glad i got these , they look great in the black and the gray . they are a tad long for me , but i don ' t mind with the other undergarments i wear , they are fine . so dark . just awesome . 
some of the reviews made me worry that the texture would be off but these are perfect , silky with just the right amount of sheen . i was also needlessly afraid that the reversible color would show through ( it does not ) . i got these for when i travel . my travel wardrobe is grey and black so these work perfect for me . the size seemed right , i am 5 ' 4 & # 34 ; and 125lb and got the size a . the legs were a little short but they are stretchy enough to work . the charcoal color is a really nice shade of grey . 
excellent , high quality tights made of durable material that doesn ' t easily snag or rip as you pull them on and off . truly reversible ! mine are a beautiful chocolate brown on one side and black on the other . it really is like getting two quality pairs for the price of one . if you ' re looking for comfort , buy them in a size larger . that ' s what i did and they pull up really easy and don ' t bind too much yet they never get saggy around the knees or anything like i ' ve had happen with cheaper tights . i wish i would have bought these tights sooner . until now , i ' d never bought a pair of spanx b / c i didn ' t care about support or smoothing out rolls , i just wanted a comfortable pair of tights . these give me support , smooth things out and are insanely comfortable . win - win - win ! 
i love dresses and wear tights all through the winter . as a plus size gal , i have to go to specialty stores to find my size and they are around $ 15 each and only last one season . i saw these spanx and seeing as they are reversible , at this price , i ' m pretty much going to pay this price for two pairs of my usual tights anyway . i must say that i love these . today is the first day wearing them . the tights i get are not usually this opaque and that concerned me , but they look just fine . the tights are soft and smooth and i feel like you ' d have to have a nail or something very , very sharp that would cause them to get a hole in them . out of the package , i was concerned they would go over my heavy thighs , and for that reason , i sized up . they pulled up smoothly , the material is so soft and stretchy and smooth . i am 5 ' 4 and have a short waist , and the panty goes up over my belly button to the smallest part of my natural waist , and they stay put for the most part , better than any other tights i ' ve ever had . this is my first pair of spanx and i thought the panty part would be much firmer since it holds in but no , it ' s soft and stretchy like the rest of the tights , just thicker . and , it does hold in - gently though . they are not so tight like some shapewear that it ' s uncomfortable , or i want to die after i eat or drink something small . i drove 20 minutes to work and got in my office and the spanx were still in place , smoothing out my plus size hourglass figure . i am wearing a red a - line dress today and have had compliments ! i almost want to say - it ' s the spanx ! another plus - these are thick enough in the panty and have a cotton crotch , so you do not need to wear panties . you can even wear them with a liner if you want . that way , you don ' t have any seams or panty lines . i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because they are long on me and while i don ' t have to adjust the waist much , i do find myself pulling up the legs of these . fortunately , i have a private office and can do this quickly and discretely . when i went to the restroom , i noticed a few lines around my ankle from the spanx bunching up a little . since they are opaque , not so noticeable though . i now wonder if i should size down , but for the price , i don ' t want to risk it . i ' m most certainly willing to live with having to pull them up a few times a day for all the advantages . now . . . off to find some patterned spanx ! 
i needed opaque tights for the winter months and other brands kept falling short ( not actually opaque , not enough stretch , tear easily , etc . ) and i kept having to throw them away . these , however , have not only lasted a long time , are actually opaque and provide a little bit of shaping ( though not much ) . they are extremely comfortable and durable . i ' ve had these since october ( it ' s now late february ) and they look just as new as when i first got them - - even after several washes . i will say that the sizing chart seems a bit off to me . based on my height and weight i am squarely in the middle of size c . however , that size was too small and way too uncomfortable to wear all day so i upgraded to a size d and it was perfect . it could be that i have long legs , or that one needs to size up in general . either way , i ' m buying another one in a different color . 
i love my spanx and these are no exception . they are warm , i like the fact they are reversible i can wear them with different outfits , they don ' t snag , and they are sooooo comfortable . plus they keep my muffin top looking flat ! ! 
these tights were not true to size - i guess it ' s a batch error because another pair i purchased in the same size fit fine . buy one size up to be safe . 
reef charges a little more for a product that is not superior to cheaper alternatives . they are good sand walkers and feel pretty good . i am purely dropping stars for price , after finding comparable sandals for considerably less . 
great fit , and super comfortable , my boyfriend now wants these in multiple colors . he had wider feet but it doesn ' t seem to be a problem . 
great sandals that are extremely comfy . the sole feels very cushiony , and the shape fits great . the bottom also has good grip and is slightly serrated . good for the beach too , because the material gets sand off quickly . 
i have a wide foot size 9 with a very high instep and flat foot . i did order these one size up on the advice of many reviews on here . putting them on for the first time , it was a very snug fit due to my high instep and the fact that the strap is rigid without any give to it . width wise they would have been fine but if they were to fit my instep , the length by ordering one size up would have been too long . if you have a narrower foot with regular or low instep then i would say to order your true size . being that i have a flat foot , the instep was very uncomfortable and the foot bed feels very rigid ( i prefer a bit more ' cush ' in my flip flops ) . i have now worn them several times a week and while i feel they have stretched or adjusted a bit to my foot , they are still by no means anything i would consider comfortable . for comparison , so far the most comfortable flip flop i have worn is an adidas raggmo . 
i have no feed back from the receiver of these sandals but when i saw them they looked good felt good little less give on the straps them expected from picture . 
my first pair of reef sandals ! after hearing from my girlfriend how great they are and buying her at least 3 pairs , i bought these . with munch anticipation i watched the tracking and when they arrived i rushed home to find . . . . . an empty porch . frakking neighbor kids got my gashdamn package ! ! ! ! ! will reorder soon and update . 
kool product . my son is totally enjoying them at the pool side . highly recommend this product . i got it a at fabulous price . 
we wear a lot of sandals , ( flip - flops ) pretty much year round in our family and everyone wears only reef brand . we have all tried other brands , but none last or compare to the reef . i know they say flip - flops are not good for the feet , but we have found wearing reef sandals is the exception . they have the needed support and walking around on them all day , doesn ' t leave us with sore or tired feet . we wear them out , and this pair is to replace an older pair , that has seen its last day . 
fit is good and husband says they are comfy . he wears 11 . 5 to 12m and the 12m fits well . great at a water park and the beach . 
normally i ' ve always liked all my reef sandals , but these were just too small and rubbed wrong in places that normal sandals didn ' t rub me . i sent them back and got a different style and they fit better . 
excellent comfortable walking for walking , shopping , beach , countryside and recommend different activities the product , taketh for future purchases are incredible 
i hate when my feet look too wide for flip flops . these flip flops are a little wider than most other ones so i feel like my feet fit better on them . they also last for years . i had my old pair for 6 years before the strap between the toes broke . 
i didn ' t really know how to shop for sandals , and i was scared to do it online , but these are just what i was looking for . they are right the size i was expecting , and i like the look of them . they have not fallen apart yet , and it ' s been 6 months . this a good product and i ' m very pleased . 
these had a padded upper and molded bottom which made the sandals very comfortable . i would definitely by them again . 
really liked the neon green . not too flashy but different from just plain black flip flops . have owned other reef sandals and a pair i had for years finally fell apart . these were the perfect replacement ! 
if you don ' t mind paying $ 20 + for what looks like & # 60 ; $ 1 in materials , you ' ll be happy . comfortable , seems like good workmanship . 
i have loved these flip flops since the day that i got them . they are extraordinarily comfortable , and durable . the underside of the part that goes on the top of your foot was soft from day one , which was great . the only complaint i could possibly have about these flip flops is that they do have a tendency to hold smell . . . . . and my feet aren ' t usually overtly stinky , but these tend to bring some stink out ! short and sweet : excellent but stinky ! 
i have owned the same exact model of reef sandals in previous years and they were great . my last pair of reefs broke a while back , so i wanted to replace them . i wanted to have the same reef sandals , since the previous pair was so comfortable . i ordered these and expected the same experience , but was heavily disappointed . the sandals are very comfortable , but i think that reef have changed their formula for their materials recently , because they squeak as i walk . within the first 20 minutes of using these sandals , i noticed a horrible squeaking noise . i had my headphones in at the time and was still able to hear the squeaking noise over my music . the squeaking noise continued so i went home and washed them , thinking that it might be a residue from the factory or that it was my feet . i tired many things , but all failed to stop the noise , so i scratched the soles with sandpaper . it stopped for a while , but continued a few days later and still hasn ' t stopped . 
this is a simple and light sandals perfect for my choice . the description matches and fitted as expected . recommended to anyone 
they fit tight to my foot , so i don ' t have to worry that i ' ll step out of them . i like the way they look and feel on my foot . 
but very good ones ! ! the arch support is great . much better than a flat surface . the insole does not & # 34 ; mush & # 34 ; down as quickly as other flops i have used . no blowouts in over a years daily use . . . . . in and out of water . for flipflops . . . . . . the price is a wow but what isn ' t these days ? 
great price , looks good , comfortable , fits welli need to make up thirteen words for this review . three more required : p 
at first i was very displeased with these reef sandals . . . . they seemed too tight and wraps wore painfully on the top of my feet . i thought to myself how is this possible , all the flip - flops i have ever had were too lose , now this ! ! ! but i gave them a few days and things changed . as my feet began to mold to the sole of the sandal they became more and more comfortable . now i can wear them all day with comfort . not only that but they hold snug and don ' t feel like they are always about to fall off . i highly recommend them . . . after you break them in : ) 
these reef sandals are very comfortable . they were used for a few hours and they were great . they will be used often . 
bought this for my spouse to bring on cruises to wear going back / forth to the pool area . great light weight and great for just slipping on / off when in a hurry and don ' t want to put on shoes . great for everyday as well . 
these are very comfortable and soft . my boyfriend loves it . will get another pair in a different color for him . 
i got these specifically b / c i have long and narrow feet ( a width heels , but normal width forefoot ) . regular slippers just fall off my feet after a few steps , literally . these stay on . for wider foot folks , i ' m not sure how they ' d do . . . but for normal and narrow feet , they are great . nice quality sole materials also ( not cheapo fluff ) . 
these were very tight on my feet . but they are very comfortable and well made . had to return it with no hassle thanks to amazon ' s no hassle return policy . 
these definitely need some breaking in when you 1st get them ( very tight ) . buy a size bigger as they run sort of small . i wear a size 9 shoe and 10 fits perfectly . very comfortable after broken in . 
it is a good sandal , but beware of sizing . i am 9 . 5 and asked for a 10 and it was still a bit small 
these sandals are resistant and comfortable . i bought them a long time ago and the soles are still intact , have only deteriorated a little in the textured footbed on the grip . 
these are great . i wear them almost everyday in the summer , and even in the winter they sometime revert to a kind of indoor slipper . 
on a trip to my brothers house over the summer i woke up early and wanted to take a walk outside for a smoke and saw these flip flops at the bottom of the stairs and slipped them on and was amazed at how comfortable they were . i had to have them . wow ! ! ! 
i find them comfortable , sized right . . . not too snug , and are holding up . i live in hawaii , so i use these to walk around town , and i take them to the beach . would definitely buy these again . . . 
fits well , incredibly comfortable , feels good to the skin , i would highly recommend it to anyone . shipping was fast . not that expensive 
these sandals fit great feel great and look awesome . they seem a bit expensive considering what they ' re made of but i havent bought sandals in years so i could just be lagging behind in the times . i would definitely buy another pair . 
i have to say , i love these flip flops . this the second pair i have purchased from amazon . they are comfortable enough to wear all day . amazon has good prices and the best selection for color and pattern choices . 
i bought these for my husband , because his sandals were falling apart , and he refuses to buy himself any clothes . he loves how they feel on his feet and said & # 34 ; oh wow & # 34 ; as soon as he put them on . 
i wear size 10 1 / 2 to size 11 shoe . i have never had a size 11 in any type of shoe be to small . it is to small in this case . i have to eat a $ 6 . 00 return fee in this case . otherwise it seemed like a nice enough sandal , it just cut off the circulation in my foot or i would have kept it . 
these are by far the most comfortable flip flops i have ever worn . the black obviously gets a bit warm in the sun . . . but very comfortable and holds up well to salt water and sand . 
i wear size 11 tennis shoe so i ordered a size 11 sandal . they seem to be rather tight at first and i was worried that i should exchange them for a larger size . however , after a week of walking in them , they seem to have stretched out and are now very comfortable . if you like your sandals a little looser then you might want to go with a size up from your sneaker size . 
my husband is so picky about sandels , finding something for him to ware to the pool or at the lake is a pain . he does like these and thats all i care about . 
got these ' flip flops ' as a replacement to probably one of the most comfortable pair i ' ve had for about 6 years ~ and i must say . . . . these new ones are miles ahead . the contour on the sandal give great arch support , and the banding on the top is very comfortable . the sandal fits a on the small size as i am normally an 8 . 5 w in shoe size , and so i got a size 9 m to fit . but my heel sits right on the edge at the back of the sandal , and i suspect if i was a true 9 , i ' d have my heel hanging over the back . . . . . so word to the wise , get a half size up ( or since they don ' t make half sizes , get a full size up ) . and yes , my foot is pushed all the way forward ( the thong is right there between the toes . . . . ) otherwise , a very very comfortable sandal . im not calling these ' flip flops ' anymore , because they fit so well , that they don ' t make the flip flop sound anymore when i walk . . . . 
good sandals , they fit as expected and adjust to the shape of the feet , they look very good and are comfortable . 
great sandals for the price in a hard to find size . worked out great to wear in wet or dry conditions . 
i am a long - time fan of reef sandals ; however , with very little use ( not even a mile ) the strap on the right side of my right sandal pulled out of bottom . i ' m very disappointed , especially since they are not inexpensive . 
i bought these as a gift for my husband . he likes them very much . he says they are very comfortable . 
i had a hard time choosing flip flops because they all had so many negative reviews . i ' m happy with my selection , though . i wear a size 10 medium or wide and i can often fit a 9 1 / 2 wide shoe . the 10 medium fits my wide foot snugly but solidly . i wouldn ' t recommend getting a size larger and definitely not a size smaller . it ' s actually somewhat of a struggle to get them on after i get out of the shower and my feet are moist . when my feet are dry , they go on pretty easy . i don ' t wear them for any length of time but the first couple of days i wore them all day around the house without any pain or scraping off skin between my toes as someone experienced . i didn ' t need any break - in period . they are not soft to walk on but they aren ' t hard either . i ' m very satisfied . 
good for folks with big feet , not as loose as my last pair ( something i liked ) but still functional none the less . i do like the bit of cushion in the heel , something lacking in some sandal brands ' products , but not lacking here . 
product was easily found on the website and equally easy to purchase . it came within the time frame expected . not exactly what i was expecting , but like nonetheless . ordered another pair that are identical to the ones i am replacing . 
reef sandals in general are durable and very comfortable . these ones are very supportive and are able to be worn for long periods . the part that touches the top of your foot is padded . finally , they look decent and i would recommend them . 
these flip flops covers the length and width of my feet but they don ' t fit on easily sadly , i have to squeeze into them . i normally wear size 13 sneakers for a just nice fit and 14 for a little more room , i now wear boots everyday from bates and they ' re a size bigger , while these flip flops are just nice , the length of the strap isn ' t long enough for me to put it on or take it off easily . i can ' t really return it as i don ' t live in the usa and it takes quite a bit of time and locally , my feet are huge and therefore hard to find flip flops in my size . the only comfort i can take in getting this pair of flip flops is that i ' m only using them when i shower at the office or when my boots are soaked and i ' m air drying them in the office hence i do not wear the flip flops often . i wish that the strap was adjustable which would have been a lot better . 
i was so happy to find white reefs again ! i ' ve only had them for a short while so i can ' t comment on longevity but if they are anything like my other reefs they will last a long time and super comfy too . 
remember when you could say that and not get slapped ? anyway , this is a really great product . still not sure any flip flop should cost more than $ 10 , but these are by far the best i ' ve ever owned . i wear size 13 / 14 d , and these are secure w / out binding ( got size 13 ) . 
plain great and simple . as with my other reef sandals that i ' ve own in the past , i expect this one to be as durable as the previous ones . 
reasonably comfortable and great for around the house or around the pool . . . . . good value for the price . would purchase again . would have liked to see a little more arch suport 
great fit . always concerned when buying shoes online because some aren ' t wide enough for a size 15 . these worked perfect . they are a great fit . 
it ' s a flip flop . the price is right . the fit is nice and tight but not too tight . i like the reef fit and have repeatedly bought more and more of their flip flops . 
its a sandal that fits perfect and seems well constructed . they are comfortable and just tight enough where they stay on the foot well on longer walks . if you have a fat foot it may be a problem . regular foot you will be good to go . 
unlike a lot of other brands and products , reef seems to have kept its eye on quality over the years . they are bombproof and comfortable . this is my third pair . the first literally lasted 8 years before one of the toe thingamaboppers disintegrated . the second pair i decided to replace after four years because they were getting a little gamey . this pair of phantoms continues the tradition . they are well - made and comfortable . i can wear them around the house or wear them on a campsite . if they get dirty , you can always scrub them with a still brush or toss them in the washer . i use a laundry bag . ( obviously , you can ' t do this with leather flip - flops , but you probably wouldn ' t want to take them camping , either ) . i ' ve tried a couple of other brands , havianas and crocs , and the quality is incomparable . it may not be an issue if you just use your flip flops for an occasional trip to the beach or the shower , but if you abuse your gear as much as i do , i highly recommend the reef phantoms . and they ' re only $ 25 . cheap ! 
i love wearing sandals more then anything else , and for the most part these delivered what i wanted . worn almost everyday over the summer , i never felt that the quality was lacking . now wearing them around the house , they do seem softer then they were , and give in a just more then i would like . this does cause minor back pain , and so i won ' t be able to wear these next summer . i had hoped they might last longer then one summer , but hey they were just sandals . 
love these sandals ! they ' re so comfy that i wear them to school and everywhere pretty much ! i couldn ' t find my size in stores so i order through amazon and they arrived promptly and wow ! love em 
got these for my husband because he loved his other reefs and he loves these as well - wears them anytime he needs flip flops ! 
the only brand i buy is reef . amazon has the best deals . i ' m very pleased with the comfort of these and am looking forward to the arrival of my other pair . 
this is my first reef sandal and i liked it . my main concern was the weight of the sandal , it is light weight and fit perfectly . 
great pair of sandals . the arch supports work great as i have fallen arches . they fit to size . they do require some breaking in though . the first time i put them on i went for a long walk and ended up rubbing a soar into the bottom of my foot . they also tend to squeek when i walk from my foot rubbing against the flip flop . i ' d buy another pair . 
i bought this for my husband who is normally a 10 1 / 2 or 11 . the size 11 barely fit on his food . i returned for a 12 which are much better . he says they ' re comfortable . 
this is just what i needed to give to my son that has large feet . he loves the fit and comfort . 
since i live in socal i ' m in my sandals / flip flops a lot ! these are nice causal sandals to wear around the house and they ' re very comfortable ! * i ' m reviewing the black charcoal sandals * 
i have wide feet i usually wear a size 11 - 11 1 / 2 in regular shoes and since their are no half sizes i had to choose the 11 . go up to a 12 ! ! ! ! trust me on this these cut small ! 
i have had a pair of reef sandals for almost three years now . they have more than served their purpose now . i figured that i would never be able to find sandals that were as soft and comfortable . then i found the phantoms on amazon and they have definitely replaced my old reefs . i suggest the plaid ones if you aren ' t sure what to wear them with . they are the most neutral colored . 
my dad loved these . he says the straps were wide enough and the sandal comfortable enough . shoes for him are usually a trial . 
so i purchased a $ 30 pair of tech treads while in florida last year , and they were very comfortable , but i didn ' t noticed they were undersized until i ' d worn them for a couple days . i read later that you should always go up a size when purchasing sandals , so i bought a size 9 of these for my 8 to 8 . 5 feet . the day these arrived , i had to leave for chicago in the morning , and ended up having someone picking them up and holding them for me so they wouldn ' t disappear from my doorstep . they arrived on wednesday , and i finally got to open the box and slip them on on saturday of easter weekend . my first thought was , " omg ! " i wanted to just leave them on all day , but i ' ve already been to one easter egg hunt today , and i plan on going to another , and it stormed all day yesterday and into last night and this morning , and i just don ' t want to trek around in the mud in these . keep in mind that i ' ve had some pretty nice sandals over the years . i lived in florida for over 10 years through my teens , and i can ' t even say how many i ' ve gone through . i ' ve had a pair of slip - on adidas for the last 6 years for the house , plus i ' ve gone through a pair of quicksilver i bought at ron jon ' s in cocoa beach 2 years ago , and the tech treads i got in jacksonville beach last year . these are $ 28 plus tax at pacific sunware at my local mall , and i got them for $ 22 + on here , with free shipping after including a nanostream flashlight for my keychain . . . and these are just the most comfortable sandals i ' ve ever felt . i think once i wear these out , i ' ll be getting a pair of reef fannings with the heel air cushion and bottle opener on the bottom . don ' t think i ' ll ever use another brand of sandal again , and i may even retire my adidas slip - ons for around the house lol . just buy these . . . you ' ll love them . 
i really cant speak to how comfortable or uncomfortable these are because they were way to tight to even have on for any longer than to determine there was no way in hell they would fit ( which was apparent instantly ) . i would suggest getting these in a store where you can try them on first and see how they fit you . 
having wide feet , it is difficult to find any footwear that fits . these sandals not only fit perfectly but are so comfortable that it feels like i am walking on air . they seem to be well constructed . so , i expect them to last . 
nice looking sandals . husband had and older pair with the bottle opener in the sole and he really didn ' t like the fit of these . these do not have the bottle opener and are much lighter than with one with . good buy , should last a long time . 
these were actually purchased for my brother , at his request . he has worn several pairs over the years and very much likes the durability and comfort of this particular shoe . 
i purchased two pairs of the reef men ' s phantoms thong sandals almost two years ago . these are comfortable and well constructed , although the bottom layer sole on one pair has started to seperate from the top . otherwise they ' re in almost perfect condition . i ' ve used them as shower shoes on occasion in some of the places i ' ve worked and they hold up very well . these are comfortable and light . i wear a size 8 1 / 2 to 9 shoe and the size 9 phantoms was a perfect fit for me . please rate this review if you found it helpful . 
i say it ' s somewhat small because i wear size 9 . 5 sneakers and size 9 dress shoes , and for this i purchased a size 10 but they fit just right . people probably will be better served buying half a size larger . but these are plenty comfortable . the fabric toe joint doesn ' t cause discomfort ( something experienced with plastic toe joints ) , and the overall build so far looks pretty good . i ' m hoping these will last me a long time . i purchased them to replace two sandals i used to wear : one because the toe joint separated from the slipper , and the other because they way i walk puts a lot of weight on the big toe and my walking eroded away the big toe area after 2 years of use . 
shorts arrived packed neatly and without any visible damage . when i put them on - the feel was firm and the grip stable . i should use them for a while to get the proper impression from their quality 
nice camo pattern and style of shorts . size was way out of normal range so pay attention to the sizing chart . i had to return mine due to size abnormality . my hips wouldn ' t fit in a smaller small waist size . 
the size was big , i must buy a smaller size to have a good fitting next time . a like the color and design . 
just what my husband was looking for in colors . the pants seem to stretch as you wear them . he doesn ' t like that but they are comfortable for knock about he said . the length is good . the price was good . i like the way they look on him . 
these run to the large end of the size scale but i had read previous reviews and bought accordingly . the construction is good , the pattern is crisp and neat and the fabric does well in a wash and dry cycle . pockets are roomy and practical . can ' t expect much more from a cargo short . great buy . 
i returned the shorts . they were definitely small to size . i was quite disappointed in them . cannot recommend based on my experience . 
i had been looking for these type of shorts for a minute here recently when it occurred to me to give amazon a shot - i ' m glad i did . well put together and a good look 
i recently purchased these shorts for my husband , and he loved them . they are so pretty and comfotable , and definitely worth every penny . i highly recommend these shorts . they have plenty of pockets , and a drawstring in the waist for a perfect fit . these are the best i have ever seen . 
like a lot of folks i ordered too big the first go around . i have a 38 " waist and got the xl first . . . well the xl covers 39 - 44 or so . the l covers 35 - 38 and is perfect . it ' s not really urban camo , just the regular snow camo pattern from years back . i ' m glad to have found this pattern again , , , they match a lot of shirts and cover a lot of mess while working . the look really durable and i ' ll probably get their vintage camo pattern next : ) good stuff ! 
there are some minor differences such as the single stitch on the edges instead of a double , but other than that they are identical from what i can gather . granted i don ' t know the fill material , but it keeps me warm like the real one i still have fro service . just like the real one the threads in the liner will fray due to use , this is not due to the fact it is made in china . 
" poncho liners are part of my household , open - trail adventures like , camping , guiding , hiking , spelunking and other uses . they keep you warm during cold weather and cool during the summer , there isn ' t anything else that comes close to these products . if you take good care of them , they will take great care of you , when you need them . i became a fan from my old army jungle days and would give them 6 stars , if i could ! " * has many uses and also makes an excellent pet blanket ! 
it is exactly as expected and is a warm and durable covering of modest weight . combined with your rain poncho to keep out the wet it can make life a lot more comfortable if the great outdoors turns out to be wet and chilling . it works just as well for napping on the couch or recliner . i ' d still like one of these with a zipper located so i can use it as a poncho under my rain poncho . one with a built in hood would not be bad either . 
don ' t leave home without it . of all the pieces of u . s . military kit i ' ve ever seen ( through 20 + years of miltiary service ) , none equal the wubbie for value for money , utility , and comfort . the original idea was a quilted , water resistant blanket that could be attached to a poncho ( hence the bits of string on the corners and edges ) to make a warm weather sleeping bag . yes , i ' ve actually heard of people doing this , but this is such a limited vision of what the wubbie is capable of . picnic blanket , quilt , bedspread , couch cover , used by itself as a sleeping back , in survival kits , for air travel , pet beds ( with or without human consent ) etc . i used to keep mine by the couch for siesta time , but it kept getting stolen . in germany , soldiers would take an unlined rainjacket and a poncho liner to the tailor and get the best cold - wet weather jacket in the world back . if the camo is an issue , it is available in solid black and olive green , but i don ' t care about the appearance . my wubbie is not for sale or trade . get your own and keep your paws off mine ! e . m . van court 
this is suppose to be a liner for the camouflage military gi type enhanced waterproof nylon rip - stop rain poncho . first of all , it does not have a hole for your head . it is more of a blanket with straps . you are suppose to wrap this around your body and use the straps to tie it down . then pull the poncho over . the reason that it does not have a hole for your head , is because you can use this for improvising a sleeping bag , and to make shelter . use your imagination . a couple of ponchos tied together , with these liners for insulation , and you can have one heck of a pup tent . but back to that hole for your head . just make one . find the middle of the poncho liner , cut a hole big enough , and hem in the edges . now you can tie the laces to the grommet holes of your poncho , and wear this as a liner . i would also get somerothco type iii commercial paracordor asolid rank karate / martial arts beltsto tie the whole thing down around your waist . 
first , let me say that i am typically warm even in cooler environments , so most blankets make me feel uncomfortably warm . i bought this for camping and general use , and seeing as it has been close to single digits since i purchased it i have only put it through pretty mild use . even so i really like the feel , softness , and insulation of this blanket . it felt a little stiff right out of the bag but loosened up quickly . using it keeps me at an acceptable temp , but the whole family seems to like it every bit as much as their fluffy and heavier blankets that make me feel like i ' m being slow roasted to death . 
great product for the money . arrived very quick . love the digital woodland camo pattern . it is also a perfect fit for my poncho . 
i have never personally owned a real military issue poncho liner , so i can not comment as to how close these are in quality or thickness . however i can say they are a great little blanket . i ' ve washed it about 4 times over the last 5 months and it ' s held up just fine . i bought two of them and used one as a ground cover quite a few times for a little star gazing by the fire with the missus . they have a nice cool feel and are semi water resistant so perfect for that . now i use the one she didn ' t claim as a woobie . i carry it in my backpack stuffed in a small dry bag . i have used it to cover up with when stuck in air ports and to shield my self from cheap motel beds . i use it on my own bed as well all the time . i really love this thing and i recommend that if you don ' t have you , you get one . 
what a nice white cap , the fit is adjustable and it ' s very comfortable . when i purchased this cap i had no idea that the mall sold similar caps of lesser quality . ( not flemsey ) 
great hat for the price . i bought a few in different colors and plan on getting more . look and feel great . 
these hats are ridiculously cheap though as it turns out not in price ! nearly transparent , stiff acrylic material , lousy stitching that is coming apart , ridiculous semi structured shape . after i returned the 25 i ordered , i went to wholesalehats . com . great selection . wholesale prices so you buy by the dozen - which was perfect for me as i needed two dozen . i learned what to look for - 100 % cotton , brass clasp adjuster rather than velcro , unstructured shape . i received , for half the price , ( $ 3 . 50 per hat ) a very decent product . not top of the line , but really decent heavy brushed cotton , great unstructured shape , good bill length , and perfect to put the logo on . 
i have been ordering these hats for a few 3 years . in the past i have been happy , but this time the product was made super cheap . not that they were of the highest quality , but i got what i expected before , now it seems like they skimped on fabric . i can see the brim through the fabric on the bill , and the stitches are not even . if all that was not enough , the hat has a permenent crease where it was folded , and is generally flimsy . what a peace of junk , especially since the price has gone up ! 
i like the hat and it looks good . it was a great price especially since it was shipped all the way from china where it was manufactured and arrived to my address in a good time frame . i wore it right away , but got it dirty from messing with the automobile . i washed it twice since i got it . machine washed . it came clean like it was brand new , but the material started kind of ragging out and showing wear that i feel it should not of been showing at two washings . it did keep its shape . it still looks good , but it just looked kind of rough as far as some spots of the material . i like it enough how ever , i would buy another one . so in my opinion it is a good product . 
the cap looks really nice . . bought for gift for someone who loves the caps . . it is simple and nice 
my father is in a nursing home and he loves to wear a white hat . he ran over his with his wheelchair and got oily grime on it . i worked on it and thought it was ruined . my mother worked on it and got it clean ( lighter fluid was the trick apparently ) . in the meantime , i ordered this one for him . when it came it was great . it is better quality than the one he has that we cleaned up for him . i set this one aside and when he does finally ruin it ( and i am sure he will somehow ) , this one is ready for him to wear . i was surprised how nice a quality it was for the money . 
i bought these for summer vacation . i wanted a cute pair that were cheap in case i lost them . i wore them less than ten times before the arm broke on one side . 
these we ' re actually smaller then i had imagined but they are still pretty nice . large lens and good quality frames . 
these sunglasses are easily worth the $ 10 or so . my wife lost her last pair of ~ $ 30 sunglasses like these and honestly she can ' t tell a difference between them . build quality is fine and the hinges are strong and actually need to be broken in they ' re so tight . all - in - all , if you need a cheap pair of sunglasses , you could spend way more than you need to ! but not on these ! 
i was quite skeptical about this when i still risked purchasing it . but can you believe it gave such great coverage around my eyes and gave a great look that i received more compliments . i have a dark complexion and none of the dark shades look good on me , but this size and shape must have changed the look i guess . a must have for all ladies ! 
i go through sunglasses like no tomorrow - i have a very on the go family and my sunglasses end up tossed into the glove box , my purse , wherever . i usually buy a few pairs and keep them for a year or two . i wanted a pair that looked cute but were affordable and you can ' t beat these sunglasses . they ' re nice and large for lots of protection from the sun and give that fashionable jackie o look that matches with every outfit . my husband thought i looked adorable in them so that ' s always a bonus . 
these glasses are perfect and i love them . i wear them when i go to the pool and they are a perfect accessory ! 
bought these in balck smoke for my mom who has sensitive eyes . she ' s been wearing a different brown pair for sometime now and i thought a black pair would be nice . i ' m thinking the quality isn ' t as great as others because she hasn ' t worn them yet ! they ' re cheap but the plastic isn ' t peeling . they ' re just as cute in the image as in person . i kind of want them back ( haha ) . contemplating just buying another pair for myself . hmm . . 
these are not the glasses to buy if you want super durable glasses to wear for the next 20 years . obviously . they are a very cute pair of vintage - inspired & # 34 ; bug eye & # 34 ; sunglasses , styled after something jackie o would wear . they are a nice thick plastic and the hinges work well . if you are looking for something for a vintage look , a costume for a play or party , or just something to add to your accessory wardrobe for occasional wear , these are a great deal . i got mine right around $ 12 and i have been using them for a community theatre production . they ' ve been dropped a couple of times and have held up well to the light use i ' ve put them to . 
i order from amazon all the time and make it a point to read the customer reviews . i had never been disappointed till now . i had been looking for larger sized sunglasses , like all the female stars seem to have . but nothing in the stores seemed to fit the bill . so when i saw so many positive reviews for this item and they were described as " seriously over sized " and " my grandson says i look like a movie star " , and " they look fabulous " i thought my search was over . these are larger than many . but the style is . . . well , there is no style . i got the tortoise brown with smoke lenses . the lenses are dark as many said and that ' s a good thing but the frames are so dark that the print barely shows . instead of looking like a movie star , these make me look like a very large fly . they are awful . i would send them back but it ' s not worth the return postage for a $ 12 item . 
these glasses came well wrapped and packaged . delivery was extremely quick . my daughter wanted " large " glasses and these were perfect for her ! thank you for your great product ! 
i wanted a pair of sunglasses to wear in the pool that were large enough to totally block out the sunshine . these are perfect . i even use them at work since i have a security light that shines right in the corner of my eye . these make my eyes feel so much better . 
these glasses are beautiful ! i bought them to use while i hunt for a 300 dollar pair i misplaced . now i don ' t think i ' ll go back to the 300 dollar pair even if i find them because i like these so much . will definitely look here first when i need sunglasses ! 
i don ' t like spending lots of money on sunglasses . i usually end up losing them or sitting on them or just throwing them in my purse with a case . these are pretty good . nice look - they are a little large - my husband thinks they are & # 34 ; hollywood . & # 34 ; but the block the glare that i want when driving and i like how they look . good purchase . 
i like these , i prefer white sunglasses vs other colors . they keep the sun out of my eyes and so dfar haven ' t broken . they seem like they will hold up . 
oversized but fun . . . might pick myself up another pair to enjoy this summer . . . ty so much for coming out with these . . and ty for the careful shipping 
my daughter purchased these for me when she purchased hers ( in black ) . they are great glasses for the price ; plenty of coverage , keeps the sun out of your eyes and have a stylish look . for the price they are well worth it . the frames are solid but nothing special , but then again , for the price they are worth it . 
i ended up returning these because they were larger than i expected them to be . they are the type of glasses that go from the top of your eyebrows down to your cheekbone and then out to about the end of the hollow of your eyes . i am a fan of big glasses but it was jsut a little too much for my taste . however , the glasses were nice , and felt sturdy enough , and came quickly , so if you like glasses that big they may be for you ! 
i ordered the brown shade and have been happy with it suring last month . it looks better than most oversized sunglasses on me . i always wanted an oversized , since they shield all around the eyes and give better protection , but i was never satisfied with how they looked on me . this one looks much better . 
i love these sunglasses . i even play golf in them . they are great to cover the entire eye region and i am happy with the type of protection ! : ) 
love ! ! ! love ! ! ! love ! ! ! these sunglasses they wear real well and i especially like wearing them when i am cruising in my convertable volkswagen . . . we compliment each other really well . . . i have already received awesome comments on my sunglasses . . . i received the sunglasses really quick too ! ! ! 
i absolutely love these glasses . they look so nice on my face . very chic looking . at first i thought i would look like a fly but not at all . they look very nice . very sexy . absolutely love them . i know friends and family are going to love them . i am going to have to keep a very close eye on them . attach a alarm to them . lol . i am going to order another pair just in case these ones get scratched , etc . i haven ' t seen these glasses anywhere else but here . i am definitely going to need more than one pair . they are very light and the lenses are very clear . i adore them . now they are my favorite . 
exactly what is in the picture an perfect for sunny days . i have to say that they are a little bit bigger than i thought which makes my eyes and cheeks sweat a little bit . 
ok so i pulled these out of the box and thought to myself " these are oversized ? ? " but then i put them on and i don ' t know they look like " so - so " but when you put them on they appear bigger and even my child said " famous " lol . these really do look like the big shades you see celebrities in . 
i love these retro inspired sunglasses ! they are large enough so they fit over my regular glasses . i got these for wearing at the beach ! very jackie o ! 
they are what they are . nothing expensive , no uv protection , no scratch resistance , but very stylish . so for the price , i won ' t complain . if you are going for " looks " these are cheap and cheerful ! ps . . . i ' ve had these for over a year now and they are still in decent shape . however , i want to note that they were priced at less than $ 10 at the time . that is what they are worth : ) 
i got these in the tortoiseshell color and like them a lot . they are just a wee bit tight on the sides of my head , but i have a large head and this is always an issue , which is an easy fix with the adjustment machine at my optometrist ' s office . they are probably fine for 99 % of the population in that regard . i like that they are large enough to block a lot of light . they are definitely a bargain and the seller was very fast shipping them . 
i love fashion and have a glam type of style . so these shades caught my eye because they appeared , stylish , unique and high quality on amazon website i collect all kinds of shades : high end designer or cheap doesnt make a difference to me as long as they look great . i liked the fact that these shades looked great but to be honestly they dont look any more unique than shades purchased from a local discount store which includes dollar general or dollar tree . in other words the only reason i kept them was because its not worth the effort to return them . 
the shipping on these was super fast but i was disappointed when i got them . the lenses are too close together . the nose bridge is very short so these make me look like a fly . they are great for sun because they are super dark . they are fashionable and seem to be sturdy glasses , but they are just too close . my face is too big for them . i will use them in a pinch , but i will order something a bit more spaced out . 
buyer , beware , these are not oversized sunglasses . they are quite regular size , any smaller sunglasses would be called tiny or undersized . i am very disappointed with this purchase . 
my favorite sunglasses , they look great and more expensive than they are . only bought 2x bc i lost other pair 
received the oversized white sunglasses quickly ! i love white for spring and summer . i coordinate my sunglasses to my outfits and have worn them several times . they are very comfortable and attractive . 
i love these glasses ! i always buy lower priced sunglasses because they seem to get broken easily but not on purpose . all the other ones i have had haven ' t fit as good as these do and didn ' t have uva / uvb protection . i have a smaller face so i don ' t like to go too oversized because it makes me look really funny . these were the perfect size for me and my older brother says they look & # 34 ; very expensive and like i ' m hiding from paparazzi . & # 34 ; definitely recommend and i really like the color ! 
these oversized frame sunglasses will help your woman show off her inner diva . they are large , agressive and super cool . 
these are just great . great look and the fit is fantastic ! these do not curve around the face which i like therefore they do not mess with eye make - up . they are dark which i need do to macular degeneration . they are big which i also like . you just can ' t beat the price . again the fit is perfect . 
this is a very inexpensive , stylish pair of sunglasses that goes well with most outfits . it is also uv protective . 
insanely fast shipping on this one . second pair of these for me . not super high quality , but plenty good for driving to and from work . cheap , look nice , and covers a lot of my face . 
these glasses are not oversized and would not buy them again . they are the color they say although the size is not what one wou ; d consider near oversize . 
received the sunglasses two days before the estimated scheduling date . looking at the picture , the lenses are a smoky black , but the sunglasses that i received are a rose color so i sent them back . 
i bought the brown pair and i love them ! ! adorable ! they are great quality and i wear them everyday ! : ) 

these are stylish shades . i love them . nice shape , oversized , good value . . . that ' s all i have to say about that . 
love , love , looooove these ! ! reminds me of the ones jackie o . wore in the 70 ' s . these are oversized , but not so big that they take away , they enhance , these are retro but with an updated look to them . well balanced , they do not look cheap at all , have uv lenses and the price is right . . . . . what more could you ask ? ? except , who is that hollywood starlet behind those sunglasses ? ? ! ! 
i like these glasses but they are not as oversized as i would like . if you have a small face they will be great . for the price they are fine but i can ' t see giving 5 stars . 
these are so much fun to wear ! the quality is nice and the fit is excellent . when they say over - sized they are not kidding , so expect big glasses ! the tint is perfect for keeping the sun at bay . 
feels more durable than sports duffle bags . it comes folded inside its own bag . bagception , if you will . absolutely love it . 
this duffel is a nice size , and is a much better price than anything comparable i saw locally . i examined the stitching and saw no problems . the fabric is not the tough canvas i used to have to a duffel when i was younger , so i ' d be careful about objects or hard corners that could poke or wear through it . it comes in a little carrying case that you won ' t need once you are using the duffel itself . therefore you can use the carrying case as a smaller container , possibly a toiletry kit . recommended . 
i bought this in 2008 directly from amazon . it cost $ 22 back then , and arrived within a week with free super saving shipping ( which is basically standard shipping ) . it arrived securely in a cardboard shipping box . nothing was damaged during shipping and all materials were new . it does what it ' s suppose to do , which is hold my clothes while i ' m traveling . the material is made out of cheap fabric , but it ' s durable . none of the seams are broken , nothing is tearing , there are no holes or anything , zipper works just fine , shoulder straps works . shoulder strap is adjustable . there is a zippered front pocket compartment , and pocket compartments on each side of the duffel . 
i was debating to get this medium or large since it was the same price and i ' m glad i ordered the medium because this one huge but still manageable . you could fit easily fit 1 wk worth of clothing . in the main compartment and 2 pairs of shoes in the end pockets . this duffle bag come folded and fit into a small bag which can be use as toiletry bag . the handles can be held together by the velcro wrap and there ' s a comfortable detachable shoulder strap to free up your hands when necessary . the water resistant canvas like material made this bag very light compare to some other duffle bags . 
i own the " large " size mountain duffle bag . it ' s super lightweight , and made from 900 denier poly nylon so seems like a good value for the price . it comes inside of a small travel pouch that doubles as a mess or toiletry tote that would easily hold large shampoo bottles , etc . the duffle has a large " u " shaped top opening for easy packing , two large zippered end panel pockets , front side pocket , rip - grip carry handle , adjustable shoulder strap and two end straps . this duffel comes in small , medium , large and extra large , so be sure to pick the one that will work best for you . my " large " duffle is 30 inches long , 15 inches high and 15 inches deep . comes with a lifetime warranty against defects . 
this is a well designed bag . i particularly like the " d " shaped zipper on the top that allows better access to the contents than a straight zipper would . the end compartments are nice and the pull handles on the ends also come in handy . it is generously sized . since others have reported the dimensions i will not comment further than saying the " med " is more than i need . the fabric seems fairly durable ; but the zippers are somewhat light weight . . this bag should hold up well for caring clothing . if you need a bag that is heavier weight ( as i do for caring equipment ) i suggest you check out the mountainsmith travel trunk line . the have heavier material and zippers . they also have compression straps to back up the main zipper . they do not have the " d " zipper or end pockets however , and they cost more . http : / / www . amazon . com / mountainsmith - travel - trunk - red - medium / dp / b0037wledk / ref = sr_1_2 ? ie = utf8 & s ; = sporting - goods & qid ; = 1279651810 & sr ; = 8 - 2 - spelli rate the outdoor products bag 5 stars for its combination of utility , construction and price point ( $ 26 for medium ) , even though for what i need the mountainsmith turns out to be a more appropriate choice . 
i ' ve been using this bag pretty consistently for several years now and it ' s served me very well . nothing special about it , just a big , reliable , study bag . 
i got the large for an upcoming 10 day boating vacation . it is plenty large , the xl would definitely have been too big . the side pockets are roomy and there is also a zipper pocket on the front . it came all folded up in a little pouch , so that ' s pretty cool it packs down that small . unfortunately , upon opening it had a very strong factory odor . it has been sitting outside to air out for about 24 hours and it still smells strong . also i can see a little hole in the bottom where the stitching is overlapped . i may need to wrap my pieces in other bags inside this bag . i hope it holds up ! 
i bought this bag to put most of my misc . camping items in for storage and to take with us to go camping . when it arrived i took the thing out and this thing is huge . i did not expect it to be that big . that is a good thing actually . i only filled half the thing up with plates , pumps , propane canisters and other items and still have a ton of room to spare . the quality is decent as well . 
flimsy garbage . thinner materials and build than the photo would let on . chinese - made . i got this because it looked like a nice overnight bag . it resides in my car trunk holding jumper cables and crap now . not happy with it . 
this is a good general use bag . the material is strong so it won ' t tear . the design is very basic . has one main large compartment , two smaller ones on either side and one very small on the front . this bag won ' t win any good look awards at the airport luggage line , but i like it for the what it is . it is simple and i don ' t feel bad when i thrash on it . i think the price may be a bit lower because the product really is very basic . 
i was use to a little stiffer bag that stay upright when you pack it . this is a duffle bag style . you have to constanly grap it to fill it . that is not a con but just what it is . the bag itself is strong and very big . it does hold a lot of clothing . i do use it every week to transport all my stuff to and from my summer place and home . i was suprise about the size of the bag . if you want a duffle style bag with plenty of volume than this is a good choice for you . my self it is too big and i can not live out of it like i need too . i seem to lose things inside of it and have to take it all out to find things . if you want to transport to and from 2 places and unload all when you get there this is the bag for you , 6 / 14 / 2013the bag stinks . i have had it 1 year now and it looks like it is 20 years old . the seams have a started to come apart . i just pack it for a trip and my stuff fell to the floor coming out of the whole in the seam . i went to check the seam and with very little effort it just rip apart . time to look elsewhere for a new bag . 
i bought the large first . i ' m keeping it for when i take a massive trip to nepal or somewhere , . . . but , the thing was just too big for a 7 day trip . so , i ordered the medium and it ' s going to work for a pair of shoes , two pants , underwear and 6 shirts . these things seem well made and the reusable bag they come in is very well made . the only draw back that i can see is the shoulder strap is not padded . that would be a nice feature to have especially since these babies can be overstuffed . medium and large are not carry - on size of that matters . 
this bag has great style and a ton of room ( i got the large ) . the extra bag that it came packed in was a nice touch and can be used to stash the big bag in your suitcase as an extra piece of luggage for the return trip . my disappointment is in the durability factor . the material is rather thin and on its own has no structure . i am sure that it will be fine for carrying a lot of stuff but i ' m not sure how long it will stand up to the rigors of travel . i bought this for a motorcycle trip out west and i believe it will be fine for that purpose but if you are buying it for many trips in fairly rough conditions you may be disappointed . it looked like it was double material ( lined ) in the picture but it is single ply . for the price . . . . . . . . pretty good . it got a 4 start only because i like the look and they added the extra storage bag as a bonus otherwise a 3 . 
i purchased the x - large bag and this bag is huge ! i purchased it to put my sports equipment inside and should have purchased the large bag instead . i have loaded the bag with all of my martial arts gear and still the bag is too big . i have all my sparring gear which includes a set of boxing gloves , 2 sets of 4 - oz gloves , head protection , leg gear , thai pads , various hand wraps , and a large gi . i also have some extra dry clothes in there and there is room for much more . the material of the bag is a little on thin side . the bag will not hold its shape unless you fully load the bag . i am really happy with this bag and will purchase the large sized bag . 
even though i liked the level of general quality , i returned it . this is a huge bag . it is too much for the kids overnight or even away trips for a few days . 
great value for given money . very hard and durable , very roomy . can easily carry 55 pounds . it is also very light so it is not a dead weight . . . 
my wife loved it ! this pendant was great for my wife and i was even thinking about getting one for my daughter for her birthday . but the clasp broke within 3 weeks and is not usable . i will be getting a little better chain with clasp that will hold a lot better than it did . but don ' t let this ' clasp ' issue prevent you from buying one . the locket itself is really nice . good product for the price . 
i gave this to my 16 year old daughter , and she loved it ! i loved it too . it ' s made well . the chain is not flemsy . the heart locket is precious in an elegant way . money well spent . 
i feel that the lockets were very well made for the money and were easy to put pictures in . both of my daughters have two children so i bought both a locket , no fighting . 
my husband bought this beautiful locket for me . the area for the pictures is large enough to see the details of the picture , but not too large . you can put a picture on both sides . the chain and clasp are strong and a good length 18 " . my husband cropped the pictures and had them printed at costco . the quality is amazing much better than using our home printer . the pictures could be easily changed , though i will keep the ones he put in it . i highly recommend this great quality , beautiful , silver locket . i love the satin finish ! 
. . . but you get what you pay for , no ? this item came quickly enough , faster than expected to be honest , but i was disappointed when i opened the package as the quality of the locket seemed cheap and a little on the flimsy side . i was looking for a locket with a little more substance to it , a little more weight . this locket definitely is not heirloom quality ; it would never last long enough to be passed down to anyone . i have been wanting a locket for some time and spent much time pouring over reviews , comparing items and prices and trying to reach a conclusion as to which to buy . i finally settled on this one because of the price . . . if it wasn ' t quite what i was looking for ( size - wise and quality ) , then for the price no harm , no foul . i got what i paid for . the locket is on the small side , thin and difficult to open and i ' m afraid that too many repeated openings will break it because the metal seems so thin . the etched design on the front is slightly rough to the touch as well , though not enough to be annoying while worn . i only received it this afternoon and have been wearing it ever since , trying to make up my mind whether to keep it or return it . while the locket is large enough to put pictures in , the pictures would end up being so small it really wouldn ' t be worth the fight to get them set . the only good point of this is the chain , it seems sturdy and i like the fact that it ' s a rolo chain . however , at 18 " , it sits way to high on me ( the heart sits just below the base of my throat ) . i should have purchased a longer chain . like i said , for the price , it ' s okay , but it definitely isn ' t what i was looking for . 
this looks like something you would buy in a . 99 store . cheap looking and weights less then 1 ounce . i returned it immediately . i would never give this to someone as a gift . 
honestly there is nothing special about this pendant . if you ' re buying a heart locket for a special person , then save up and buy something nicer because this one isn ' t that great . 
i have had some problems with my neck , this great necklace make fell so relax , unfortunately i traveled to visit to my brother who lives in mexico , and as i mention how great do i feel , he asked me for my necklace , i told him that i would sell it on 100 duels , and he said that it was fine if i promise him that he would feel as good as i do . honestly i did not want to give it to him , but as i love him i did , now i already bought anotherone . 
i bought this as a gift for a niece . she told me that she liked it a lot and so did her friends . 
nice necklace . a bit pricey but my son loves it . he ' s 10 , thin and tall , the 18 & # 34 ; fit well . got the black and he wears it for baseball and to school sometimes . seems pretty good quality and it has a break away feature for safety purposes . all good . 
it was very good quality . the clasp is kind of hard to open . get the smaller size for kids . size 22 was way too big . it hangs down more than i wanted . 
get me as an article phiten cost of white as was wishing . until it finally got enough and i like to recommend the community of amazon 
these things are great ! they are lighter than other similar boots i have had in the past . i have had them for about 2 months and i still wear them everyday . i would say that they are about . 5 size bigger than what they say they are . all of my other boots are 11 and they fit great , these are a little big . i solved this by adding in a thicker insert . update 8 - 7 - 12i have been wearing these boots for a long time now and they still feel comfortable and have held up well . the only thing that is showing sign of wear are the top of the toes . i tend to kick things allot so they are damaged from my actions . everything else looks almost new still and i have worn these things all over the place . if these ever wear out i ' m buying another pair . 
compared many site , many prices . fro my needs , this boot is tops and comes with a composite toe which is great for going thru metal - detectors without a hitch . also great for foot protection . the boot breaths well , is light and durable . takes a spit shine after the wax build up nicely and is a long - lasting value . great purchase . 
bates , bates , bates , being former military this is a very common shoe , this particular model not so much , but needed for my new civilian job i went right for them . hoping to get the quality that comes with the bates name i got these . they worked great when i got them and now about 8 months later they are falling apart . not even the common part like the sole , zipper , or laces but the " leather " or whatever on the back over the heel just ripped in two . the big issue i have is this new job is security , i don ' t have to run at all , barely walk , these boots probably have about 30 miles on them total so this happening is just a shame . just be careful with what you get . 
well made , but there ' s a large jump from 12d to 12 - 3e though . i ' m somewhere in the middle for width , so i chose the 12d ' s . they are a tiny bit too skinny . hopefully they will wear a bit , but still , a width size in the middle wouldn ' t kill you would it ? - - - - - - - - - - - - edit 3 / 27 / 13 : add to the total cost $ $ of these boots : 1 . a set of knockoff dr . scholls foot pads " spenco polysorb cross trainer " $ 142 . and most importantly at least one set of " foot petals - heavenly heals " $ 14the heavenly heels are for the back of the heel . if you don ' t add these and you ' re socks aren ' t made of thick rubber , these boots hurt . they have 0 % padding . no padding whatsoever . try walking in these or god forbid working in these things for longer than 30 minutes . the back of my heels are killing me right now . just tap on the heel part of these boots from the inside and you ' ll hear an echo . if these boots came with dr . scholls and at least some padding for the back of the heel , i would give this product 5 stars . as it is , i have 2 months of training starting in 4 days and i really needed these boots . now i ' ll have to * 2 day ship * some heel padding to me at even more extra cost . hopefully these heavenly heels work ! ! 
i ordered this boot in the size i normally purchase 11 , but it was way too big . i returned it immediately and i am waiting to go to a store to try on which size bates works for me . 
i lost my wallet so i was in desperate need to find a new one and this one caught my eye . pros - nicely made - budget friendly i paid $ 24 for mine - beautiful bright color , i got the red and it looks exactly as it does in the pictures - plenty of storage for debit or credit cards business cards and money . - the snap that keeps the wallet closed does not easily come open which i find nice when it is in my purse - the wallet is a larger one , i would gauge the length as comparable to a check book and it is bulky kind of like a small clutch . - this is a wallet that has decent weight to it , i like this but some people may notcons - i find the coin section clamps come open quite easily spilling my change everywhere . overall i am quite pleased with this product and would recommend it just don ' t keep a lot of change in the coin part . 
i ' ve been looking to get myself some nice quality items , and one thing i wanted was a nice leather wallet with space for my checkbook and lots of slots for cards . this wallet gave me everything i was looking for . i got it in red just to spice things up a bit , and i couldn ' t be happier with my choice . this wallet holds all my stuff , and yet is still only half as thick full as my old wallet is empty ! the leather is soft and feels so good ! great buy ! 
this wallet is exactly what i wanted . i didn ' t want one that zipped around , or had zip pockets for cash . this has a snap close where you put your paper / coin money , and seems very secure . it has lots of slots for credit cards , and pockets inside for other items . there ' s also a place for your removable checkbook . i chose the red one , which is a nice color , and the leather is really very nice . mundi is a good name , and i ' m glad they ' re still around ! 
i love this wallet ! holds everything i need and more : money , checkbook , coins , cards , id . doesn ' t get too bulky and holds together well . 
i feel like i am repetitive saying , & # 34 ; just what i was looking for & # 34 ; , but darn it , this was just what i was looking for ! 
fast shipping ! really nice leather ! this is a darker tan color . i like the color though . has lots of room for credit cards , receipts and so on . definitely recommend ! 
i checked all the stores i could possibly think of before looking on line . should have done this first ! this is exactly what i was looking for ! ! love the color . . . the picture is true to color . the description reads & # 34 ; pink & # 34 ; . i do not call this pink . well made and great price . highly recommend ! ! 
i ' ve been hunting for a new wallet for months and then i found this one . good size ; great price ; super color ! 
i love this wallet . soft leather . double gussetec coin pouch . have three hall and receive pocket . many slots for credit cards , removable check book cover . it was what i was looking for . if i have to order , i will . beautiful for christmas gifts . 
this is a very good organized wallet ant soft . it is a bit bulky for me , but it that is not an issue , it is beautiful . it has a very good check and cards section . and place for change . 
i don ' t have much complaint about the product itself ( i was sent the wrong item ) but the seller ' menswallet ' is horrible . after i pointed out that i was sent the wrong item , the seller asked for a picture of what was sent . i send them the picture and they immediately realized what they did . but instead of providing me with a replacement they started to fooling around me . their first offer was to issue me a $ 5 refund and keep the item they sent me ( like , really ? who does that ? ) . then i told them i ' ll only accept the item i ordered and their reply to this was , we don ' t have it in our stock anymore . i didn ' t believe them , of course , because their listing on amazon was still up . i pointed that out and they told me to return the item and they are ready to refund . at this point , i knew i have had enough crap from them . i told them i am not taking any hassle to return this item because the seller was just trying to be a smartass on a cheap wallet . then with a sarcastic voice , they asked if i am unable to print the return shipping label they ' re offering , and last line being , & # 34 ; hope this will resolve your ' serious ' issue & # 34 ; . i chose not to contact this people again ( they are poor at communicating as well , roughly 1 reply a day and i had this going for around a week i guess ) . i escalated this to my first amazon claim and as expected was issued a full refund . the item sent ended up in the garbage - took picture of that too because this seller tend to come back and asks for proof ( yes , this is the other way round ) and will lecture how their business works and they have a policy and all . just a joke . the hassle i had to go through for a cheap wallet is really pathetic . i chose not to let go because i saw they did this to other buyers too and wanted to see the end of this . buying from menswallet - you ' ve been warned . the wallet itself - it ' s not bad considering you ' re paying less than $ 20 ( i got a replacement ) . 
i asked for this as a christmas gift and will already be replacing it , because the clasp on the coin purse does not stay closed . i just have to look at it the wrong way and it pops open , spilling coins into my purse . the slots for credit cards open to the left , so if you are right handed you have to turn the wallet upside down to slide them out . . . another huge problem . it is cute , nice leather , but totally useless ! 
i really like this wallet ! just what i needed and i especially love this color ! fits well in my purse and is easy to access what i need when i get into it ! 
this is a nice wallet . the leather is nice - not cheap - and it is just as described . it is well made . the credit cards holes are a little tight but they work . very pleased . i bought one in black too and like it just as much . 
i bought this as a present . if i was a girl , i would buy this for myself . it feels like good quality leather . it can fit absolutely anything you can possibly want to put into a wallet . 
i am beyond disappointed by this wallet . i specifically looked for one that held a checkbook . this one has a checkbook holder , but it doesn ' t fit in the wallet once you actually put the checkbook in . also , there is no plastic film , how in gods name should i write my checks ? once the checkbook is added , you can ' t close the wallet . in addition , the credit card slots - aren ' t even and not all hold the credit cards . really ? ! what a waste of money , i ' m sorry i ever bought it 
i ordered the apple green , and got the product as pictured . it ' s ok . the leather was scuffed up a little , had some dirty spots . i buffed it up with some leather cleaner / conditioner and it ' s fine now . shouldn ' t have to do that with a brand new wallet though . it doesn ' t really have anywhere to put cash . you can tuck it where the checkbook holder goes ( i tossed that first thing , who carries a checkbook anymore ? ) or in the change part on one half since it is divided . but it ' s really tight , no way to actually look through your cash while it ' s in the wallet . hopefully it stretches out a little . 
the color is great and it have a lots of different options to place , your pictures , credit cards , your check book , change section and bills section . plus other sections to place other small paper items . i choose this rating and i like it because of the different options to place things . i would recommend it to my friends . 
i was a little concerned that some reviewers received their wallets which didn ' t appear to be well made or that had cheap non - leather inserts . that may have to do with which seller they went with as well as the price . mine was one of the higher priced wallets . my particular wallet , in the apple color which is pretty close to the picture , maybe a tad darker although not by much , seems to be well made , checkbook cover inside is also leather and removeable and i love the buttery feel of the leather . very soft . the coin portion has two compartments , one each for coins and bills , and roomy enough . there are two id windows and i count 16 card slots although the product description states there are 17 . they might be counting one of the id windows . then there are 3 bill and receipt pockets as stated . you can stuff the wallet and it closes pretty easily . all in all , i ' m very satisfied with it . 
in an effort to start saving up money , i decided to stop buying fancy " name " brand purses and wallets . so , when my beloved kate spade wallet wore out , i turned to amazon . my main requirement was that the wallet looked classy and was all leather . this wallet filled those requirements nicely ! i love it . it is a nice supple leather and the cc slots are also leather ( a lot of other wallets make those cloth / nylon ) . i am thrilled with my wallet and i can ' t believe i used to spend over $ 200 for wallets when this one is the same quality ( or better ) . i ' m a fan of this brand now ! 
i have been looking for a wallet with this type of change purse for a long time . my grandmother had one when i was a little girl . this wallet holds all my credit / debit / membership cards and still closes fine with the checkbook out of it . since i rarely write a check these days , that isn ' t a problem at all . i love that it has no zippers as the last few wallets that i have replaced only needed to be replaced because of a bad zipper . it seems to be well constructed and is real leather so it should last a long time . 
having had my last wallet for over ten years , it was difficult for me to move into a new wallet . i read the customer reviews of this wallet and was convinced to try this one . the wallet arrived quickly and is exactly what i was looking for . lots of room for everything that i stuff into my wallet . the leather is nice . you can ' t beat the price . the only drawback . . and it is a tiny one , is there is not a plastic check divider to keep your written information from showing on checks below the one you are writing . but that is easily fixed . i am very happy with this wallet . . 
this purse is great . it has a lot of places to put your cards and looks nice . it is very nice quality . 
very excited to get the mundi wallet . . . nice size holds all my cards . very good buy . . could tell my friends about the great bargain . 
this wallet came as expected . the color is beautiful it has all the space you need to put your cards , cash , pictures you name it . i am thinking on buying another color also . 
buy this wallet but when i received it was not what i expected totally different from what you see in the pictures of the publication , is of very poor quality i get broken in several pieces removed and a line as if it was cut into the top purse besides this came with a smelly material seems old walletthe good news was that i did receive a complaint about this purse in these conditions it was not what i expected and the amazon store i solved the problem thanks to amazon 
i got this wallet as a temporary fix after a wallet i got in italy finally gave up the ghost . i like this one so much that it won ' t be temporary - - it will be the one . it is nicer in person then in the photo , the leather is soft , and it is easy to organize . i also like that the checkbook cover is removable . 
this wallet is gorgeous ! i wanted the green one , but it wasn ' t prime eligible , so i went with the red instead to save about $ 10 . i was really disappointed at the time , but upon seeing this in person , i think it looks great . quality : excellent . the inside is just as well - made as the outside , and i can see this lasting a long time . functionality : tons of space , tons of pockets . that ' s what i was looking for . size : 7 . 5 " x 4 " and expands to around 1 . 5 inches if you put enough stuff in there . 
i ' m happy to have found this wallet . i would purchase it again in another color when this one wears out . so far it is holding up well after a month of use . shipping was slow from this seller but it is worth the wait . the only problem i find is the kisslock clasp that closes the coin purse is really a bugger to open . not recommended for arthritic fingers or i ' d consider getting one for my mom who is forever rummaging through her wallet ( s ) to find that certain card or coupon . oh & the snap will fasten even with the wallet stuffed to the max . that ' s a real plus too ! 
i have been looking for a wallet for a while and i have finally found the one that does it all . it has enough slots for my cards i have along with a well size snap closure for coins and bills . 
it ' s ok to put many cards inside . but the pocket for money is too small . i ' m a little disappointed for it . 
i was looking for a wallet to replace my trifold ( they are really hard to find in women ' s styles ) , and this popped up as an amazon suggestion . my requirements for a new wallet were that it have : 1 ) plenty of slots for cards2 ) a coin holder of some kind ( parking necessitates lots of quarters ) 3 ) two slots for money ( i use one for receipts and one for cash ) 4 ) a plastic id window5 ) be leather so that it will hold up longersince i loved the green color of this wallet , i thought i ' d give it a shot , along with thebuxton parkview zip double cardex . they are very different wallets , and i really didn ' t think i ' d like the relatively longer and bigger style of the suburban wallet . however , once i got them side by side , it was no contest to decide which one to keep . the cardex had tons of slots for cards , but it was really chintzy looking on the inside ( cheap polyester fabric ) . not so with this suburban wallet , which has leather slots for all of your cards ( not just a leather facing on the top of the slot , either , but leather throughout ) . once i got all of my stuff in it , i realized how much smaller and nicer this wallet is that my old trifold . it snaps closed with a satisfying click and the " kiss " coin holder is perfectly cute . the check book cover doesn ' t fit inside the little pocket like i thought it would once my big checkbook was inside ( i use the kind with carbons - maybe without that it would fit ) , but i just thew the checkbook cover separately in my purse and it looks so nice as a matching accessory . i ' ve already gotten complements from friends with much bigger budgets for these things than i . it ' s a very ladylike and nice alternative to my old wallet and i am quite happy i bought it . in all , it ' s shocking how high - quality this wallet is for the money , and i could see myself buying another easily . 
i love the color of this wallet , but the quality is not great . i always buy leather , which this is , but the edge of the window compartment has had a small tear in the leather since i bought it . there is lots of room for credit cards , but the snap coin purse is somewhat hard to open and there ' s not much room for photos . i am and will continue to use this for a while , so at least i got my money ' s worth . 
this mundi wallet has everything i need as a busy woman . easy but secure access to cash and change , card slots that are big enough but not too big , and a removable ( thank you ! ) checkbook . not bulky , but it holds everything . 
i have a lot in my wallet and no it isn ' t money . lots of papers , and some receipts and discount cards . my previous wallet was extremely fat and heavy . this one is still able to carry everything i had in my previous wallet , but this wallet makes everything a lot slimmer ! fits perfectly in my purse , and not heavy . fits my checkbook perfectly too . 
for a wallet that contains a checkbook , it is rather tight . no room for it to expand much . i put 6 cards in the slots in front of the pocket with the snap closure , which does not fill all the slots . it makes it quite thick and bulky , and does not leave much room for the checkbook . with it closed and a full pack of checks in it , my checks end up curved slightly . my current wallet is a checkbook wallet and this does not happen with it , and it also holds the 6 cards in an upright position , and has a snap change pocket . unfortunately my old wallet is wearing out after many years . i like the green color , but for me this wallet is not a keeper . 
i really like this wallet . not only does it look great , but it has the space to back up the look . i thought the likes ofalicia klein wallet " park avenue " was a spacious wallet , but i think this one even gives alicia klein a run for their money . in anycase , this is a great wallet to have . you will not be disappointed with it especially if you are looking for a wallet with style . 
i wear 42c and have bought the same size from lilyette , bali and vanity fair . both vanity fair bras that i bought fit nicely while the size for the other two brands seem to be off . 
finding a bra to fit has been a challenge . if this were a cotton bra i ' d rate it five star , but i long ago gave up looking for cotton in a lined bra . the fit is even better after a few washings . i have this bra in three colors . 
i ' m so glad i ordered this bra . i had also ordered another vanity fair bra that closes in the front , which i also really like , but this one is very pretty . it ' s very comfortable on and also along the sides . i ordered it in 38dd , and the cup size is just right with no pooching of my boobs at the top . the floral pattern is very pretty , but it still is smooth enough you can wear it under a t - shirt just fine . will be ordering another one ! 
i have problems finding bras that fit and this one does a pretty good job . it is soft and comfortable . 
i like the fit ( 40c ) . it has held up very well ( wash in mesh bag , never dry ) . con1 : manufactures went to heat sealing ( instead of sewing ) the sides of the hook tapes which resulted in sharp edges in the back that actually abrade my skin and annoy me no end . every bra i buy ( even the $ 60 ones ) , i take an emery board to lightly sand the edges . no amount of washing helps . con2 : straps elongate involuntarily - a big let down ! is it possible to fabricate bra strap elastic that is not shiny and will not slip down from its position in the clip ? i used to have bras that had clips with edges that would grip the elastic . i have to resort to putting lumpy safety pins on my straps or live with old lady boobs . 
i ' ve recently lost about 50 pounds and have about 20 more to go . i didn ' t want to invest much money is a bra that probably won ' t fit in a couple months . heck , i wasn ' t even sure what size i am currently . i made a guess and ordered this bra since i figured i ' d only be out $ 25 if i was too far off . but i must have guessed correctly . this bra is incredibly comfortable . the " girls " are fully supported ( no cleavage popping out of the cup ) and the straps don ' t dig into my shoulders . and on top of that , it ' s actually very cute too ! i ' m back ordering a second one . and i ' ll be back again once i hit my target weight . so much for blowing 50 bucks on bras ! : ) 
i love these bras . they fit great . i can no longer find them in town at any of the stores we have . so glad amazon carries them 
this is a fabulous bra . i ordered the 34dd and it is comfortable , supportive , provides lift , and the cups are nicely lined . it provides good , supportive coverage so that you are not " spilling out . " the bra was true to size and i could not be happier , especially for the price . i just wish some of the other pretty colors were available in my size ! 
great full coverage bra , fits as expected . comfortable . a great buy for the money . i have purchased these before and will do so again ! 
i bought this bra based on reviews and it did not disappoint . it is true to size , has nice wide bands , and is very pretty and soft . it was instantly comfortable and did not bother me as the day went on . both cups and band fit well and were comfortable . everything stayed put ! i am very happy and ordering many more as we speak ! 
in over 30 years of wearing bras , this is the most comfortable and best fitting bra i ' ve ever worn - and i ' ve tried them all . the cups on this bra are seamless and lightly padded against show - through , and the shoulder straps stay in place without digging in . it has the standard sliding adjustment on the straps , and two hooks on the back strap . it runs true to size and the underwire is comfortable too . it offers full coverage , and yet is low enough in front to compliment cleavage . i love the way it fits ! it is a little expensive - $ 25 at the time i purchased them . but for a great fitting bra with quality elastic i am happy to pay the price . with free supersaver shipping on amazon , it ' s a great value . i wish it came in more colors - i ' ve only been able to find electric blue , fuschia , white , beige , black and a dark purply / brown color called la perla pink . if vanity fair would make this one in some patterns or more colors i ' d be in heaven . as it is , i bought six of them , because as all women know , immediately after you find a style you like it is discontinued . as a side note , i found these bras at jcpenney ' s too . they had limited sizes and colors , at the same price as amazon . 
this is my favorite bra ever . so comfortable . natural shape . no heavy padding . easy to wear . looks invisible under everything . fast shipping ! 
i have noticed that this style of vanity fair is getting harder to find in stores , so i turned to amazon . i bought a few to stock up on - - i have been wearing them for about ten years now . very comfy and soft . the material in the underarm area does not ride too high like in other full - figure bras . the straps are stronger than the typical thin ones that can cut into your shoulders , but aren ' t too wide , like you ' re wearing a harness . i tend to have a reaction to nylon thread and lace with bras , and itch terribly . not the case with this bra . comfy comfy for this size 40d . 
i love this bra ! been wearing this style for a couple of years . i have looked everywhere for it and couldn ' t find it in stores . i thought it had been discontinued . wa , la ! there it is on amazon . it will be hard to find another to fit me this well . 
this is the most comfortable , attractive and well - fitting bra i ' ve ever owned . it has excellent support - i ' m definitely going to buy more ! 
these are comfortable bras . not the sexiest , but i wear them to work and they are comfortable all day . i have several and will be buying more . 
after becoming pregnant , i needed some new bras . i got a couple styles , but this one is by far my favorite . the support is great and the underwire doesn ' t dig into me like some of the others i bought . this bra is comfortable to wear all day and looks good , even in a larger size . i will definitely be ordering another of this style . 
i have small shoulders and these straps were only halfway adjustable so i could not make the straps small enough to stay on . i returned it . 
no part of this bra worked my wife said it was too small , scratch , poky and just a bad bra . . . it would be nice if all the manufacturers could get together and have standard sizes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
the product is ok . however , you get what you pay for - as it is not well made . would not purchase from this manufacturer again ; however , the seller provided quick service . 
perfectly priced , sexy , and an absolute must for bedroom action . this product came in a perfectly packaged box , and is highly appealing . you will absolutely be pleased with this purchase , especially if you like lace . 
it was more than i expect , fit me perfectly as i am size 8 us . i found it very cute and sexy too . 
anniversay gift to myself . . ost 40 lbs and wanted to looks sexy for the husband . . he said i was beautiful . 
i thought i would have a problem with this being a one size dress since most one size items run on the smaller side , and i ' m not super thin or petite , but this is a beautiful dress ! it arrived on time and looks exactly like its shown . it fits beautifully ! 
a total waste of money , does not look appealing and does not cover much . regret buying it , but it was not misrepresented . 
my wife is around 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; and curvy . this piece is gorgeous on her . it fits well and accentuates everything . very comfortable and well made . i had thought the slit in the dress was more to the side , but it ' s right down the center which worked out to be quite an advantage : ) 
a very provocative . gown love it . now would . recorder , thisitem very comfortable . no problem i need . the red one later thanks very beautiful plan order another ! , i have the black . one thanks very much 
i like the dress itself . i have got a plus size , and was highly disappointed . the open front tries to run back to my butt making a huge very ugly whole in the front . yes , i have a big butt , but it ' s not as big - size 16 . and advertised plus size will , perhaps , only look good on 8 - 10 butt size . but plus means up to 1 - 3x ! it will perhaps stretch on to a girl of 3x on the top , but the open front will look ugly . i am returning the item , cause for 17 dollars it ' s too bad - looking on big girls . do not purchase plus size if you are more than size 12 , it will not look good on you . especially if you are also tall . 
i already bought something for valentine ' s day but i just had to have this ! very sexy and classy with a set of pearls and nice hells . item arrived on time . 
this item is great my boyfriend and i really really love it we had a lot of fun it fits nice and it looks just like the picture more than what i expected . 
i liked this little number on the wife , she fills it out very well and let me just say that it didn ' t stay on too long , would highly recommend 
if you are looking for something and are large on top then this will fit you pretty darn good . i do wish the color was red but the black is good . i like that it is long and does fit good . i would order more if they had more colors or if this happens to get destroyed in the bedroom . i think the fit is nice and the price was very good . i am short at 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; and is not to long so that is a plus for me . 
its hard for me to find outfits like this to fit my body the way it should . . usually one are is off just a bit . this one , fit everything perfectly , and it drove my husband wild ! the material is very soft and you know sometimes when you buy an outfit and it just doesnt seem like good material , like its cheap . this is not like that at all . its very worth it ! 
i am 5 ' 9 and wear a size 8 or 10 , depending on the cut and 36 dd bra size . i love how this gown glides over my curves , and so does my husband ! however , with any movement , the front of the gown rides up up too high . i doubt this would be an issue for a woman of average height . the material has a lot stretch , so i imagine someone of average height up to a size 12 or 14 could probably wear this comfortably . however , i am not sure this would work for size 12 - 14 women , who are my height or taller . the front would likely rise up to the navel ! 
this is a great watch . it ' s got a 200 m water resistance , an easy to use interface , and it ' s very damage - resistant ; i ' ve been wearing it while working in a warehouse and while exercising for the past few months and it honestly doesn ' t look much different than when i first got it in the mail . if you ' re looking for a basic watch that will taking a beating , g - shock is always a good way to go , and this one is basic and not as ugly as some of the others ( don ' t get me wrong , i love them , but they ' re ugly ) . i ' d recommend this over timex for a workout watch unless having a bit more weight bothers you ; it really isn ' t heavy and it ' s comfortable to wear ( the strap is wide and textured ) and it ' ll hold up to way more abuse than a timex . 
i like dress watches and usually wear something more elegant than this casio watch , but i felt like having something casual and thought it would be fun to have a digital watch like i had when i was a kid . this watch is great for me because it ' s big and beefy but very lightweight . it probably weighs a lot less than any of my other watches , yet it seems fairly durable , and it ' s so inexpensive that you don ' t really worry about it if anything should happen to it . one of my favorite things about this watch is its simplicity . with a quick glance i can see what day it is , including the day of the week , in addition to the time . i know that might not seem like a big deal to most people , but i ' m kind of absent minded sometimes , so it ' s actually nice for me when i can look at my watch and see that ok , today is saturday . yes , i can do this on some of my other watches , but they have dials mostly , some of them that need to be set periodically , so i can ' t really trust that maybe i set it correctly , or else they are tiny and hard to see . also i like the timer feature , for when i am cooking something and i can ' t hear the timer in the kitchen because maybe i am too far away . some reviews i read say the buttons are very hard to push , which i found to be true in the very beginning of owning the watch , but after an initial breaking in period , they are a little bit easier . not to say they are a soft touch , they do require some effort . the upside is that you ' re not likely to push one of the buttons and change a setting by accident by bumping it . 
buttons are a bit stiff as spoken of in earlier review , however , that ' s the nature of this beast . mudman , now that does make sense , no fluids in , no mud in , . . . no failures ! the watch has all the features you ' ll need to be able train and survive : - time - countdown repeat function - two stopwatch functions - day - date - tide / moon for fishing and huntingthis watch can handle itself while you perform with the most challenging environments . it won ' t disappoint you . 
so your thinking about buying this watch . first off , it ' s a good solid watch . not too big for a 6 - 7 inch wrist . comfortable to wear . it has all your your basic functions . if your into extra bells and whistles go for the casio riseman ( which i own and highly recommend ) but that will add another $ 100 or more to your budget . basically i like the look of the watch , i ' m not too much into the other various colors or negative displays which they have in this model . try one on at your local watch shop , test the buttons as they can be hard to press for some people . if it looks good on your wrist , and you love it , buy it on amazon for the best price on the market . remember no review can replace an actual test run on your wrist . you will know if it is too big or if it is not for you . one more thing i would like to add is that a bigger watch does not mean a bigger display . if you are like me and your irish eyes ain ' t smiling as much as you get older , the display may be a little difficult to see . another reason to do a dry run at the watch shop . i have a casio sgw 100 which i think has the best display for reading glass folks like us . it has a digital compass , thermometer , mineral glass ( instead of cheap resin glass ) display and the numbers themselves light up when you press the light button . a good looking functional watch at a budget price available right here on amazon . i have had it over a year with no worries . hope this helps , good luck with your mudman 
g - shock doesnt disappoint . this watch wears well , and has all kinds of ' fancy ' features . im in emergency medicine and this watch is perfect 
the watch looks great . it could take a pounding and keep going . price is okay and it got here in good time . it has 5 alarms , hourly chime , and other sounds if only you could hear it . i ' m not kidding that casio has messed up on just about every new watch that is coming out . you have to have the thing next to your ear to even hear it . i have an old watch which sits on the table about 20 feet from me . i lost the instructions , so now every day at 3 : 20 pm the damn thing goes off . loud and clear for about 2 1 / 2 minutes unless i get my lazy butt up and push a button . anyway , if you don ' t need the alarm , then go for it . the buttons that are hard to push was not a big deal for me . 
i purchased this watch on september 27th and received on the 30th . the watch is very light and well balanced . it just feels like a tough watch . the material is very dense . setup is fairly straight forward and a breeze to do . it is water resistant ( seeing as to how the first thing i did was toss it into my pool ) . also a very bright back light which is crystal clear to read . now to clear up a few things . 1 . the resin textured ribs on the back . yes , they were a little irritating for the first few hour i wore it because i tried to get a feel for the watch and moved it around my wrist . after a few hours i stopped noticing them and by the end of the night i forgot i had the watch on completely . 2 . the buttons . yes , the buttons are more difficult to push i agree . but i like that . this is supposed to be a tough watch . not a little toy . the buttons have to be able to withstand a beating and water . i am sure once broken in they will be a bit easier to press . overall a great watch for an outstanding price . i got it for $ 60 . i look forward to owning more g shocks in the future : ) 
i got this for my son ' s 12the birthday since its the in watch of todays kids and adults . i tried to press the buttons and its a tad hard to do . my son loves it and its not mine so i just put it out there that the buttons are hard to press . 
i own several g - shocks and love them all . this is a great watch , the features are just what i want & need . my only two nits - and they ' re minor nits to be sure : 1 ) the buttons are * very * tough to hit . i was expecting " stiff " buttons , but on my example they require a very ( very ! ) deliberate push to operate . i guess the plus is you don ' t need to worry about accidentally changing modes with this watch . 2 ) the tail of the band likes to slip out of the retention strap . i have a big wrist and wear the watch on the 4th set of holes from the end . at that setting , the tail likes to slip out and flail about . not a big deal , but none of my other g - shocks does this . all - in - all a great watch . it ' s more casual and sporty , but nothing too obnoxious ( in my opinion ) . i also very much like the back light - it ' s very bright and crisp ! 
i purchased this watch after wanting a g - shock . well , it just so happened that time changed back an hour right after i purchased the watch . no problem , right ? i try to change the time . . . and the upper left button no longer works . so as long as i wear the watch during the summer , i ' ll have the right time . the rubber strap is not very comfortable either . it should be more flexible . very frustrated . i ' m still just sitting on the watch because i ' m too aggravated to take the time to actually send the stupid thing in . i won ' t be purchasing another g - shock for a while . i ' ll stick with suunto . 
i bought this watch to wear at work on board ships . i beat the hell out of all my watches and wanted one that could take a beating . this thing is tough . the mudman appealed to be because sometimes i get grease all over my hands and i gotta say no grease got inside my watch . i can take it off and scrub it in the sink and it ' s all clean . 
this watch is everything all the other post mention . yes , it ' s true that the circle buttons on the right side are hard to press but the square ones on the left are a bit easier . auto el is nice for me since i work at night and i can quickly look over at the mudman and the light turns on for me . love the 4 alarm features you can set them by daily , monthly or just one day . very light some times i forget i ' m wearing it but was kind of hoping it was bigger . other than the buttons which i think will cushion up in time . this is my first g - shock since i ' ve been shopping for one and was told that this was a good starter for the series . i ' m happy with this purchase . * * * update 12 / 17 / 2012 * * * as i said before the buttons are much easier to press now . the only one that doesn ' t get much use is the actual button to turn the light on in the front since i use auto - el . i use most of the functions now on a daily basis . 
i wanted to write a review for this watch based on my personal experience . in some cases , not all , some customers will give a watch " one star " for not being what they expected , nothing more . in my case the mudman watch was in perfect condition and i loved all of it ' s various functions , the way everything worked and set up and it ' s wrist appeal . the only problem i had , as some others did was the little " nubs " on the resin case back that provided clearance between the back of the watch and top of your wrist . i wear watches on my left wrist and have a very small 6 . 5 " size . one of the nubs actually rubbed the skin a bit raw and i could not wear it for any length of time . the buttons on the right side were tough to push but i expected this , that ' s why they call it a mudman . . . . right ? it is sealed well and can probably withstand any punishment you can dish out . i tried various settings on the band , tighter to keep it from moving around somewhat on my wrist , and one hole looser to see if the chafing problem would clear up but it didn ' t . other than the problem with the " nubs " , a great watch and i would recommend it . it might be better suited to people with a bigger / thicker wrist size . i simply returned it to amazon for a refund and have since ordered a different g - shock . 
this is a high quality watch for a very reasonable price on amazon . the back light is so strong you can even use it in the dark as a mini flashlight ! this g - shock watch is also not too heavy nor bulky , and looks great with its ' countdown graphic on the left side . even though the red buttons are a little hard to press down ( they are supposed to be - this watch is mud resistant ) , with a little effort they move just fine . i have no power in my fingers , and i can adjust the settings and alarm just fine ! this is a very durable , yet relatively lightweight digital watch ( it weighs about the same as my much smaller timex ironman watch ) . this watch ' s wristband is also fairly flexible , and the mudman is great for mountain biking , hiking , or any activity where you need g shock protection and dirt is involved . 
i have had g shocks for years . they take a hit like no other . this one was a great price . i use it for running mostly as i have quite a few dive watches that i like to wear for other activities . if you are looking for your basic g shock with a little upgrade get this for the money ! 
i received this watch from my girlfriend for my birthday and was very impressed with it straight out of the box ( before trying it on , more on that later ) . it was in my top three g - shocks that i was considering so i was thrilled that i got it . it is very sturdy and well constructed . the digits are easy to read and the back light is very bright and it allows you to read all functions in low light conditions . it has some very useful features and multiple alarms with a snooze features . when i put it on this is where things came apart , and i have the same complaints as many others on here . the textured " nubs " on the back of the watch are awful . i have thick skin and it is in no way sensitive , but those textured nubs will rub your skin raw . what an awful idea ! if they were smooth , they would still be bad but the fact that they are textured will grate your skin . also , the buttons have far too much resistance . if you need to navigate through some of the functions , it will leave indentations on your finger because you have to press the buttons so hard . not practical . to summarize , the watch was returned within 24 hours for those two cons . they were so bad that it completely ruined the watch for me . pros : - attractive - relatively lightweight - sturdy - legible displaycons : - horribly uncomfortable - buttons are too difficult to press 
this watch functions great but now that i have it i really dont care for the looks of it . i shoulda opted for a more expensive one or a cheep knock off walmart one . . . 
we own a number of g - shocks - my boys own the following : gd100 - ms1 , the glx - 5600 , g7900 - 1 rescue , g2900 - 1v . i own the g9300 - 1 mudman , and this - the g9000 - 1v mudman . of all the g ' s we own , this is right up there with my favorites , and i wear it often . it actually sees more wrist time than my g9300 since it is smaller and wears lighter , i like the way it wears . at first , i was not as satisfied with the function buttons - originally they were difficult to push as some have clearly stated in other reviews . however , i am not sure if they have loosened up over time , but they don ' t seem to me that they are as hard to push as when the watch was new . i operate the buttons now without thinking about it and without much difficulty now . like i said , i am not sure if it is because i got used to them , or they have worn in and loosened up - it might be a little of both . although they are not as easy to push as the other g ' s i own , it is not that big of a deal . as far as functions - i bought the g9000 mudman due to it ' s reputation of having one of the better g modules out there - and in my opinion it has lived up to that billing . two stopwatches , a countdown timer , international timezones , four alarms , snooze , a nice bright , easy to push light and more . . . . plus , i like the way this reads compared to other g ' s in normal lighting - it has a bright face , and reads well in all lighting conditions . the letters , date , etc are all easy to read too - even for my old eyes ! many other g - shocks have certain parts of the face that are not easy to read - like the date on some models , but on this mucman due to the display brightness , font used , etc i like the way it reads and have no trouble with it . the only " con " i can think of is the " 2 " used in military time - it is a little " squashed " due to the way it is displayed . . . . a minor thing , but it is a lame looking " 2 " . others have complained about the nubs on the back being uncomfortable when wearing the watch for extended periods - i have not noticed that , and i have used it for woodworking and other strenuous tasks . it might depend on how tight you cinch the watch while wearing it , or perhaps on wrist shape - i could see that others could be bothered by it , but it has not bothered me at all . also , others have complained about the buttons being difficult to push - i have to agree the buttons are not the easiest to push compared to many other g ' s , but like i mention above i don ' t mind it or notice it as much , and it seems to have improved as the buttons have become broken in . the buttons on this mudman will not be for everyone , i am not trying to say they are easy to push - only that i don ' t mind them , and i realize to make the watch mud proof there has to be some trade off . considering i got this watch for much less than the retail price here on amazon , i could not be happier with its performance after five months of ownership . would recommend to anyone looking for a tough , good looking g . 
not much else to say about this watch really . however , one plus that goes over looked is the fact that it has screw bars instead of spring bars . this is a real plus in my opinion and makes this watch a real keeper . it actually wears thinner and a tad smaller than the typical 6900s which is odd to me but i ' ve never had one malfunction with it . 
i just get this watch a few days ago . i buyed it because the really agressive look it sport . i have had previously a casio hd600 for 18 months so i already knew the gimmick of this watches . in this model was aditionally important to me : 200 meter wr , shock & mud ressistance , the automatic light feature and the mineral glass . the buttons are stiff but not unpleasant . the only two things i would add are a bilingual week days ( english - spanish ) and a 60 / 40 distribution of the dial for the hour - date display , since you look the time much more than the date . the price on amazon was the lowest . vicente . 
very cheaply made with a thin covering of leather over padding to add substance . a disappointing product . older versions of the same shoe were made much better . 
made in india . leather is thin , light weight , and cheap . foot bed offers no real support or orthopedic advantage . heel is like plastic . leather soles will offer no traction . now what is so good about this shoe ? why 5 stars ? there are much better shoes out there . you get what you pay for . if you can afford it , buy a pair ofallen edmonds men ' s dalton lace - up boot , alden men ' s 9 eyelet wing tip boot shell cordovan color 8 , wolverine mens 1000 mile boots , orred wing men ' s 6 " iron ranger boot . what you get here is an inexpensive , comfortable boot that does not require any breaking in . just oil them , polish them , and wear them . good year welt means that you can re - sole after reasonable wear . you can also have a reputable cobbler apply avibram rubber half soles replacement . yes , this is not the same well built shoe that stacy adams put on the market when they were founded in 1875 . what you have here is one of the best shoes that you can buy for under $ 100 usd . this fashionable shoe is really a timeless classic that can be worn with jeans or a suit . 
these boots are way more comfortable than they look . make sure you order them wide enough as they seem to run narrow : i wear a medium but ordered the e2 size and felt only slightly wider than a medium . very shiny high gloss leather . slippery soles so not good on ice or snow . i will try to switch out the laces from the flat cotton to a dressier waxed type . 
they look like something made by a 7 year old taiwanese kid . . . who just stared making boots . the material looks cheap and feels cheap ( the black is not as glossy as in the pictures of them online ) . i sent mine back and paid a few dollars more for a super sweet burberry boot . i cannot tell you how cheap they look and feel to the touch ! 
i just received this pair of boots ( delivered to the door as promised ) , only one word comes to mind . . . wow . i bought two pair of these ( before the price increased ) and at $ 98 . 00 , the boots were an incredible price . the black ones are extermely stylish and i was a bit skeptical of how the brown ones would look . . . in a word . . . wow . . . i am extremely pleased with the style , the workmanship and the sizing of the boot . having read on this site they tend to run bit narrow , i ordered a size 14 and i ' m glad i did , not so much for the narrowness but for a bit more room in the toe box . these boots are a must for any collection and for those having a shoe size above a size 12 , these shoes some how tend to make the foot look smaller , whether it is the cap toe with the antique styling or the narrowness , i ' m not sure , but the boot is definitely a keeper . . . just love em . . . i can already tell the brown ones will be my favorite of the two . 
my husband originally had a comparable silva product which turned out to be defective ( two different ones both got moisture under the face when he wore them out working in humid , not wet , conditions ! ) . so i decided to get the casio and he loves it . the readings are accurate and he does not have to carry the instruction book around - - very intuitive . we hike in the nys adirondacks so all the features are fun to play with . 
i bought this for my husband for father ' s day and he absolutely loves it ! it was very quick to setup , looks great and is very feature rich . granted the thermometer is not the best feature since you do have to take it off and wait for 20 minutes or so , but the compass is so cool ! he ' s big into hiking so the altimeter is fantastic . my guy won ' t wear anything but casio and this is now is day - to - day go - to watch . for the price , you can ' t beat it ! 
nice multi - function watch . it is larger than your average watch , but the green version is good looking and does not come across gaudy at all . actually looks sporty . the band feels very secure and the watch is solid . it ' s water resistant to 100 meters . the functions are easy to navigate and the interface is fairly intuitive , although you will need to at least skim the manual to know how to work all of the functions and to calibrate and reset altitude and compass reference points . it has 5 daily alarms , hourly chime , barometric pressure / altitude reading and trend chart , air temperature ( reads warm when wearing the watch , but perfect reading when attached to my backpack ) , altitude alarm , and compass ( which is functional but not a serious tool ) . great watch for the price . very happy with it . 
the pag 40 is an older model in the casio pathfinder series . it does not have some of the features of the newer models . however , it does have one of the best displays of the entire series . it also has a " rugged " look to the watch which i and many find appealing . it isn ' t an atomic model , but it keeps very good time . the " abc " features of the watch are not always precisely accurate , but close enough for the average person ' s needs . i tend to use the barometer and i like the 24 hr graph to show the barometic tendency . i have several different pathfinder models and this older model remains one of my favorites . the only " negative " would be that a battery change involves getting 4 new batteries . 
i have this watch i absolutely love it . it is quite large but very very comfortable to wear . i can wear it all day and not feel it on . the features are awesome for such an inexpensive timepiece . for $ 130 + you get more watch than you can ask for . i would consider this over other watches in this price range . 
this watch is a great equipment for mtb . i ' m a mountainbiker and i used it for locations view and altimeter . it is easy to use it and confortable . 
received and quickly returned this watch . it worked well and has a great list of functions , although the compass is very skittish . i was suspicious that the watch would be too much plastic and buttons but decided to give it a shot anyway . well , too much plastic and buttons . 
i wear this everyday . i use it everyday . this watch has taken some big hits and bounced right back . i love it 
i have a number of pathfinder / protrek watches from casio . the pag 80 is an " abc " ( altitude / barometer / compass ) watch with a solar battery . each " abc " casio has similar and different characteristics . the solar battery is usually a plus . the readout on this model is very good . it is one of casio ' s largest pathfinder models - this might be of concern - - depending upon the size of your wrist . once the barometer / thermometer / altimeter are calibrated they give a acceptable degree of accuracy . casio does not claim that these are " highly precise " instruments . the compass can also be calibrated for magnetic declination . i really like the size of the digits in the display . they are very easy to read " at a glance " . this is a great watch for the out - of - doors or for every day usage as well . 
this is the third pathfinder i have owned - all three have been great watches , with one minor exception and hopefully this watch will change that - this watch is a solar watch which is not supposed to require battery replacement - if that is true , then all should be good - because , on the replacement of batteries , you can ' t do it yourself - you can try , but very doubtful if you will get the watch to function normally again - one last thing on pathfinder watches - take them off when in the shower , the soap buildup from after a few years will jam up the mechanisms for the different functions of the watch - 
i like this watch . so far it ' s solid and reliable . i do have a tendency at times to hit buttons which flip it off the time setting but is easily reset . in addition this watch is big . if you are a large man with big arms it will probably look just fine . if your average size like me it might appear a bit overlarge . 
great features and rugged . use it 90 % of time . bought for hiking and outdoor activities . love it . no need for batteries . sun charges it . 
wow . . i found it by fluke just browsing at coscto and i just paid it 89 . 00 bucks . . im surprised to see it so expensivce here . . its a great watch . . i dont like the green coloured buttons on the side . . the temp . is if off because it takes a reading off your arm , . . so it is alwyas 7 degree warmer . . you have to take it off your wrist and place it down then in about 25 - 30 minutes the temp will readjust to the correct temperature . . nice watch . . but check elsewhere for prices . . update : i dropped the watch out of my car . . " don ' t ask . . " well it fell onto on coming cars on city road . . and i see a small truck just run over it . . strap went flying / / / / etc . . the watch itself was a total loss . . shattered dome , just gone . . not a g shock from what i hear / . / 
really nice . easy to use . not to heavy for my hand 
bought this watch as yet another watch - present for the boyfriend . it ' s perfect for everyday wear . i would recommend this to those who prefer not to wear metallic bands on a daily basis , but instead rather a durable and stylish watch . . the watch itself is of good quality ( after all , it is casio ) , but what really sets it apart is the band . love love the tire patterns . my brother actually wants a different watch with a similar band so i guess we ' ll be searching for that . 
this watch is my everyday watch for a while now . . . rugged stylish and eye catching . will recommend to anyone for there collection . 
i like the watch , but certainly haven ' t drunk the g - shock kool - aid like a lot of others . unfortunately , the time is difficult to read in most lighting conditions . there also are a few other issues with the design , but i got used to them very quickly . 1 . the watch face is a little " busy " , meaning there ' s a lot of things going on when you ' re trying to read the time . 2 . the digital read out is relatively difficult to read in variety of light , especially very bright light ( like when you ' re driving ) because the contrast is bad . the readout is best read in perfect , indoor , indirect light , which seldoms exists . also , the hardlex crystal is very reflective , so there ' s a lot of glare in direct light . note that the photo in the product listing was taken under perfect lighting . 3 . i would have preferred a g - shock button on the front for the back - light in low - light conditions , instead of using one of the existing function buttons . 4 . the sweeping digital second hand , which is the round thing on the left center of the watch , is almost useless . it ' s too small and dim to read , even with the back - light . there ' s another seconds indicator in the digital time , so the sweeping digital second hand isn ' t really necessary anyway . 5 . it ' s difficult , but not impossible , to get the analog hands to match the digital time . however , that won ' t last , and you ' ll need to set it each month . frankly , i don ' t care if the two times off by a minute or so , but i know a lot of people that do . 6 . there ' s a lot of function button sequences to remember in order to set the times and also for the alarms . although this is my first g - shock , i learned them very quickly . all in all , i like this watch , but would be hesitent to encourage someone else to buy one . i also would suggest going to the gshock . com website first to look at all of the different possibilities . note that a lot of people are fans about g - shock watches ( as in " fanatics " who own 20 g - shocks ) . keep that in mind when you are reading reviews . 
there is no question that when it has came down to watches over the past 30 years , casio has been one of the most influential brands in the watch market . they definitely broke the mold when they became the very first digital watch company back in the 80 ' s , and since then they haven ' t been duplicated . that shows well with so many of their g - shock watches , and this one is definitely a great one . the men ' s g300 - 3av g - shock watch actually works well not just in the digital readout , but also with the analog movement of a traditional watch . the movement of the hands works in perfect sync with the digital displayed time , has a very high 200 meter water resistance , and is great for any watch owner young teenager or for the business casual . it definitely suits very well , and at a price that is definitely affordable . i absolutely recommend this casio g - shock watch as a great buy for any watch lover young and old , and for anyone whom wants to be fully in sync by time . price : b + setup : b + overall : b + 
i don ' t really have any complaints about this watch except the loop thing that slides over the tip of the band just plain sucks . it doesn ' t stay in place and i have to constantly readjust it . otherwise it seems pretty rugged and stylish . * * * as an update i am reducing this watch to 3 stars because of the annoying band issue alone . the loop that slides over the end of the band simply does not stay in place and works its way to toward the clasp , making the band start sticking out too easily . 
i tend to put a lot of wear on my watches - and have gone through a lot of them over the years . this time i decided to go with something a bit more solid and this is perfect . the band is both more comfortable and feels a lot more solid than the bands on the past few watches i ' ve owned . it doesn ' t chafe at all - and that ' s a good thing because i never take it off . it looks great - a very nice balance of elegance and durability . i tend to like sporty watches - but i need something that ' s comfortable at work as well , and this works in both contexts . it ' s got a nice bumper around the glass - my last watch got scuffed , and this helps protect against that . it ' s easy to set , the time , the analog hands , the alarm clock ( you can set up to five ! ) . changing modes is a cinch , and it ' s got a timer , a stopwatch - everything you ' d expect . works great - i ' m very happy with it . 
i am a big fan of casio watches for a very long time . casio has a watch for any person price range . my casio g300 - 3av looks good and works just the way i like it . 
first let me say i own 4 g - shock watches . this one , the ga100sd - 8a , dw6900 ( white and black ) . this one definitely has the smallest of all the watches faces & casing . so if you ' re looking for something large and noticeable then this isn ' t the one . that being said , i absolutely love this watch . aside from the military ga100sd - 8a this has the best functionality in my mind - and definitely the most comfortable of all to wear . the band is wider than all other 3 watches and conforms to your wrist due to the design being much more modular and doesn ' t lay out straight in the least bit when you set it down . it actually is preforms into the shape of your round wrist so there ' s no & # 34 ; bulginess & # 34 ; you my get with typical new resin strapped watches . it has a great backlit led much like the other standard g - shocks for the digital displays as well as glowing hands for the analog . feature - wise the list is endless . i love being able to chose your time - zone ( based on a code in the manual ) and as i live in ohio , it allows me to turn on or off the daylight savings time function . it then syncs the analog hand to the second to coincide with the digital display which i keep in 24hr format working in a hospital and need for medical chart documenting . it with the simple press of a button you can then see the gmt time it is based on and then go to its timer , countdown - timer , 1 of your 4 alarms , and so on . the main display also lets you easily swap between displaying the date or actual day ( based on the mm , dd , yyyy entered during setup ) and the setup is a breeze - 5mins tops . i want to buy more at this price if this were to ever get lost , as i highly doubt it will ever get worn out or break based on it ' s construction . this stays on at work , in the pool , in the shower , while sleeping . . . most of the time because i forget it ' s even there . and a great alternative to the pop - culture & # 34 ; military & # 34 ; look of most other g - shocks i own . it looks deceivingly simple , and simple looks sophisticated . . . worth every penny and would have paid more . side note : there was some discrepancy on color from casio ' s site and this . the color is solid black , metallic frame you see , and a charcoal gray face , no green like some have said . 
this is one of the nicer looking g - shocks i have seen . i have 3 g - shocks of different style and wanted one that was a bit more stylish that i could wear in more formal situations but was still easily identifiable as a g - shock . i also wanted one that was a bit smaller that i can wear with my motorcycle jackets tight fitting sleeves and gauntlet gloves . this watch fits the bill perfectly . it looks great and fits just right with my motorcycle gear . i gave it 4 stars because the lcd display for the seconds is way too small and virtually useless and the band is one of the stiffer plastics that is not quite as comfortable as my other g - shocks . the functions are great , i use 3 of the alarms daily to assist me to take my meds , i am a diabetic . i use the count down timer allot too for cooking and timing the watering of my plants and lawn . as a g - shock watch , i expect it to last a very long time . one of mine is 12 years old and going strong . i wear them hard . using power tools , off - road and street motorcycle riding , snow and water skiing etc . if you are looking for a nice looking , smaller , analog digital and obviously g - shock watch , this is a great one 
got these for my teenage son for christmas . he really likes them . they are a big on the light side as far as the mirror goes , but he ' s not complaining . very happy with this purchase . 
these are pretty good quality , much better than the cheap sunglasses you can buy at local stores . i ' m very happy , and if i lose them or break them it ' s not big deal . 
for 9 dollars i am very impressed with the quality of these aviators . they are also very comfortable to wear . 
got these for my boyfriend . such a great price for a set of 2 , great uv protection and great quality , my boyfriend loves them 
bought these for someone else . she loved them and they are ok , not really cheaply made , and have held up well 
cheapppppppp and look great but a lil big for women . my husband still thinks they look good so i ' ll keep em . 
i love these glasses . i wear these on my motorcycle and i know they will not fly off . they come with a nice case that fits them prfectly . 
these are awesome for their price . i order a bunch ever summer , because they ' re so cheap you can afford to loose them , replace them , and give them away to friends . they look a lot more expensive than they are . 
for the price , they are ok . unfortunately , after about a week of use , the mirroring wears off - even if you ' re careful not to touch the lenses . just setting them in the car sunglass holder rubbed off some of the mirroring . if you just need them for a one time costume , have at it . 
these glasses are huge & nearly blackout glasses . if you have a large head and don ' t need to see where you are going this product is for you . 
i have to give these 5 starts because for the price they are great . if i paid more i wouldn ' t be pleased . these do not look or feel like expensive glasses . however , they work and they ' re cute and if they get broken then i won ' t be heartbroken . they are also very light which i like because i tend to get headaches from glasses . the lenses are pretty dark , great for driving , but not so great if you are walking around at an outside venue and needing to look at things . i found myself having to constantly take them off so i could see things . that being said , when these get broken or lost , i ' ll be back for more . 
the sunglasses are reflective which i was looking for , and very dark on the inside . will make a great gift for yourself or others ! 
better than expected quality for the price . i bit bigger on my face than others i have had but they are fine by me ! 
these are great sunglasses . i have a large head and they fit very well , they have excelent shading abilities , and are super cheep . 
good plain aviators . they are mirrorlike . problem is their quality is pretty lacking . screws fell out of half of them and they break sooo easily . 
ridiculously awesome for the money ! only downside is , as others have posted , that they are very dark . other than that ? great fit and super cool looking . 
these sunglasses are not quite as mirrored as i would have liked but still pretty decent sunglasses for the price . 
i received these and was excited until i put them on . the bridge connecting the lenses was not bent , and as a result the glasses were very lopsided when put on . i looked ridiculous ! i was really upset because this happened to another pair of mirrored aviators i got from amazon . they are cheap glasses , so i am not too surprised about this , but i am upset it happened with two different pairs from two different sellers : ( 
these are worth the money . they aren ' t glasses that you ' ll want to wear everyday , but if you need a pair for special occasions or as a backup , these were fine . came with a velvet pouch . 
the lenses are truly mirrored and the sunglasses are exactly what you ' d expect . i rated four stars just cause the ' re pretty large and look a bit goofy on my face . 
this cheap pair of shades look great . they actually look much better than the price suggests . the order came with a cotton drawbag . unfortunately , while jogging , i managed to drop them and the lenses took a good battering . the bag also fell apart within a couple of weeks , but for four dollars , there ' s not much to mourn . best dollar shades you ' ll find on here . 
first i rated this item one star because the glasses i received were damaged . no , not damaged en route . these looked like they were damaged before and probably during the packaging . there were scratches all over the lenses , nicks in the frame , and the frame itself was bent like a pretzel but , that was easily fixed . now for the lying . i received a message after rating this product one star that if i changed it to five stars , i would receive a new pair free of charge . so i did and almost half a year later , nothing . 
these tap shoes are classy , pretty , and perfect for little girls taking dance class . my daughter loves how they fit , and she even begs to wear them to school ! totally worthwhile buy . 
i purchase the dance class t101 patent flexible tap ( little kid / big kid ) , black , 3 m us . . . for my daughter for summer dance class . this was good purchase . they fit as expected and were not that expensive . they get the job done . 
these shoes are well worth the money . the sizing was right and the price great . shoes like these can cost much more than i paid ! 
last year we had the & # 34 ; stiff & # 34 ; version of these tap shoes made by the same company . they never did get them & # 34 ; broken in & # 34 ; . my daughter complained them constantly and never wanted to wear them . she always took them off during class . but , these shoes are nothing like that . they ' re very flexible and she never complains about these hurting her feet . they ' ve broken in nicely . but , she never complained even when they were still new . i will buy this shoe again . never going back to the & # 34 ; stiff & # 34 ; version ! 
great price , true to size amazing quality . no complaints whatsoever , my daughter absolutely loves her new tap shoes . no need to ever buy them anywhere else . 
i purchased these sneakers for my wife , ordering 1 / 2 size larger as recommended by other reviewers . they were promptly delivered . my wife loved the looks and feel of them . unfortunately they were too small . i returned them to seller as instructed . that is when i realized that they did not come from amazon . i requested a larger size or refund . the seller credited my charge card minus 7 . 50 restocking fee . i contacted seller and told them they were not at fault for the sneakers being too small , but i should not be charged a restocking fee because they could not send me the right size . i got a & # 34 ; sorry , but too bad & # 34 ; reply from them . so beware , when purchasing from this seller , they do not have free return shipping . 
great sneaker . fits comfortably , looks good and i would recommend to others . they wear well and i am able to stand in them for hours . 
i found these shoes to be a tad to small for their sizing an they are hard an uncomfortabl , should have sent them back but after what i paid in shipping an what i ' d have to pay to send them back i would be out alot of money with nothing to show for it : 0 ( 
excellent comfy shoe , cute with scrubs . i need more incline and i can ' t walk in flat shoes due to a bad back . this sneaker is very well made and i would defineately recommend them to anyone whoe doesn ' t mind a lower heel . i have ordered more pairs of the same brand ( love volatile sneakers ) in higher heels . 
reviewer by jen , william ' s wife : okay , i didn ' t have the highest expectations for these shoes . i would never workout in anything besides the best athletic shoes no matter how tall or cute these might make me look . i simply wanted a tennis shoe with some height that i could wear walking about the mall or the supermarket that wouldn ' t look ridiculous and would be comfortable . these disappointed me immensely . they are only about an inch higher than normal athletic shoes , and while they are cute and look very nice , are made of a very stiff material that does not bend with the natural toe action . the problem is not in the sole padding but in the upper toe area , and this cannot be alleviated by adding foot pads . i used these to simply walk about circuit city for a few hours and my feet were purple afterwards . i hate to leave the house in anything lower than four inch heels , and most of them are much more comfortable than these shoes . i plan to give mine to goodwill ; they are that painful . 
these boots are great ! i received them on a friday and wore them immediately . i wore them all weekend and received multiple complements on them each day . they are very comfortable and look great . after reading other reviews , i decided to get them in 7 . 5 ( i usually wear a 7 ) . they were a perfect fit . of course , leather is always better quality but these are a great humane alternative . i am definitely getting others in this brand . also , i walked in them all day on friday and they were quite comfy . sunday night i had a migraine and went to the hospital in them and i felt they were still super comfortable . 
they work great with my skinny jeans & leggings . the fit is snug perfectly , and i love the look of them . 
these boots fit really snug . i would suggest getting them a half size bigger than you normally wear . i love them though and wear them often . 
i have chunky calves and have issues with boots not wanting to zip up . these fit great and have adjustable laces so you can loosen or tighten the fit . these are a great price and great quality . 
they aren ' t comfortable to wear all day , but they are cute . i don ' t expect them to last long but for the price they ate worth it . they are made of plastic . 
i ' m a big boot fan , and i love these ! ! after a couple years of heavy use they ' re still holding together . they are showing some wear , but they still look and fit well enough to continue wearing . super comfortable . they are pretty true to size . i usually wear a 7 or 7 . 5 , and i ordered a 7 but a 7 . 5 probably would ' ve fit just a tad better . i kept them though a end they were just fine . i highly recommend these ! 
i usually wear 8 - 8 . 5 . i ordered the 8 . 5 . fits great . very comfortable for all day wear . also warm . the laces can be loosened for larger calves . the only issue is the squeaking noise . i ' ve been wearing for about 3 weeks hoping to break them in but still has the squeak . 
this my second pair . they only last a couple of years and then the zippers don ' t work - - but they are worth the price . love the way they look and feel ! 
good fit , comfortable , and durable for being cheap faux leather boots . these run slightly small . i wear a narrow size , these only come in medium width , and one boot is just a little too short . great fit on my small calves too . 
when you have small feet you better have skinny calves or tall boots are a problem . i have small feet ( 6 or 6 . 5 ) and slightly wide calves . if i buy a size 8 . 5 or 9 the calves will fit while my feet slide around the far too big bottoms . when i read the reviews on how these fit , and that the calves part of the boots can be adjusted i decided to give them a go . i was able to make them work , but i had to loosen them as much as possible . i also bought a size bigger than my size . they may not fit perfectly , but they fit none the less . they are very cool looking boots and i hate heels so my oddly sized feet and i are very happy with them . best of luck to the rest of you and your tootsies ! 
these boots are beautiful ! great quality leather , pictures are very loyal to the actual product . you definitely get what you see . they are beautiful : ) 
i love these boots . i have large calfs , ( 15 inch ) . after loosening the laces on the size 8 boots they fit fine . snug but feels good even with skinny jeans underneath . the buckle is on the loosest band . they are beautiful and good quality with nice laces . i liked them so much i bought a second pair for my friend and she loves them as we ' ll ( she also has large calfs ) . 
great boots . a wonderful , thick sole that is great for harsh weather . clean easily and are comfortable . shipped quickly , high quality and would recommend 
i give these 4 stars and not 5 because the calf strap needed to have an extra hole punched to fit properly . however , these boots are great otherwise . they fit exceptionally well . i wear a size 6 . 5 and find these to be incredibly true to size . i also find them to have a very large calf circumference . i wear a designer petite size 4 , but have snowboarder ' s calves . they measure 15 & # 34 ; ! finding boots that fit well in both the foot & calf are always a challenge because of this . i would highly recommend these to anyone with a similar problem . take the chance and actually buy them in your size . i think you will be pleasantly surprised . if you have a calf larger than 15 & # 34 ; , i would highly recommend the nana pole climber boots . they also fit larger calves and run incredibly true to size . hope this helps someone out there with muscular legs ! 
these boots have grip for the snow and ice . i ' m clumsy and i haven ' t tripped with these ! it ' s true to size and my calves are a bit big so you can adjust the laces and the strap for more room . i love the way they look and they ' re comfortable to walk around with 
pros : beautiful and funky for a cheap boot . live them ! complaints all the time . i have a 13 " calf and rarely can find a boot that doesn ' t look like i ' m swimming in them . cons : first pair i got had a warped heel support and had to be returned . however my next pair showed up fast . i have high arches so the instep was really tight , nothing a couple of wearing a didn ' t cure . i have arch supports in them now and they are fine . these fit like narrow sized shoe . if you lean towards the upper size of a medium fit , these are going to be supper tight . i would also recommend a half size increase . te toe box isn ' t small , but it is a but narrow . that extra half size gives you better wiggle room . 
i bought a pair of these a couple of years ago and loved them . they don ' t last like real leather does , but that ' s the price you pay for vegan shoes , and they were such a reasonable price that i feel i got more than my money ' s worth in compliments when i wore them ! i was delighted to find these in my size , on sale on amazon and snapped them up . i ' ll still wear the old ones for slogging around the park with the dogs , and wear these when i go out . they are very comfortable . i bought them in 10m - my size is 9 . 5m but that ' s a hard size to find in any shoe , and size 10 works perfectly with this boot . i could jog in them if i was so inclined ! and they ' re sexy - badass without being too " butch " ! i definitely recommend these boots . if they ' re still around in a couple years , i ' ll probably buy yet another pair ! 
i ' m 21 and i recently got these boots in midnight black . they fit exactly perfect on me . i use these shoes when i go to rock / metal concerts . i was looking for a slightly more girly combat boot than doc martens . these are amazing and very comfortable . i think instead of wearing uggs i ' ll wear these all winter instead . [ . . . ] & lt ; ~ ~ ~ picture of me in boots . 
the boots are comfortable , while there is a zipper on the side you can still tighten or loosen the shoe laces that run all the way from the foot to the top of the boot . not leather , but an excellent deal ! 
i am love ' n these paratrooper pants . i have been wearing then a lot now and they are way comfortable . great wash and wear . 
as described . not a big fan of the s / m / l / xl sizing , i am 6 ' 2 & # 34 ; and 205lbs so i like a 34 & # 34 ; x34 & # 34 ; and got the large . waist is perfect ( it has straps to tighten in the back ) and the inseam is 32 & # 34 ; . so they are a little shorter than i like , but they won ' t drag the ground so i guess it ' s okay in the end . very , very soft material and pockets have plenty of room . 
had to have them hemmed since i use them like regular pants but other than that , they are great pants for work especially in the summer 
comfortable . not heavy duty but seem tough enough for use if you don ' t need reinforced knees and hems . useless drawstrings at bottom . run a little long . perfect for dexter costume , many complements with immediate recognition . buy these . worn on saturday mornings too for comfort . extra free advice . buy american apparel olive thermal henley if you are going for the dexter bit as well as black diamondplate ? latex gloves ( available on amazon too - i use these all the time working on my car and house ) 
true to size , ( im a small ) , arrived quickly and exactly as shown and described . i love wearing these , so i need to order another pair because these were to be back ups in my hug out bag , but they are so comfortable , they haven ' t made it in the bag yet ! i highly recommend ! 
these pants are very soft , due to being stone washed before they sell them . they fit very well and the color is a nice brown color . the material seems to be real sturdy and would be great for hiking around or wearing around town . the stitching seems to be very good and doesn ' t look like it will fall apart . it has ties down at the bottom of the pants legs like old school bdus . . . i cut them off . 
great quality cargo pants period . the service is excellent . to help a little , i am 32w 30l . i flirt around with both sizes of small and medium but the small fits more snub . 
these pants are a good 8 inches too long . aside from that they ' re a great pair of cargo pants . 
i wear these paratrooper pants when riding my harley because the lagers have ties at bottom to keep them from blowing in the wind . there is two adjusters at the waist so anyone from 34 to 38 can adjust to fit great . 
this is awesome ! if you hike this is very comfortable ! this is one of my favorites now ! i like so much am going to buy one in kaki and other in coyote ! 
these cargo pants are so comfortable , they feel almost like sweatpants , yet look so much better . they ' re lightweight , but seem to be strong . i ' m hard on my clothing as i ' m active , and these pants have held up wonderfully . they look really good , and i plan on buying other pairs in different colors . i ' m 6 ' 175 lbs and at first went with the size large . however , they were much too big . so i gave them to a friend i owed a favor too and is a much bigger guy than i am . i then ordered size medium and the fit is near perfect . there are plenty plenty of pockets and they fit nicely around my boots . highly recommend if you ' re in the market for cargo pants . 
the color is beautiful . . . it is great size not too big and not too small . . has a sophisticated look and is easy to open and close : - ) i guess you can tell i like this umbrella 
i really like this umbrella ! so much so , that we bought 2 of them , and everybody else must love them too , cause they keep getting stolen . 
bought for son for christmas so he would stop taking mine . he really likes it . would buy for any guy . 
i love this umbrella . it looks great and works great . i ' ve always wanted a long umbrella like this and i finally have one ! the reason i give it 4 / 5 is the metal cap on the handle . it was loose . but very easy to glue ! 
beautiful , functional , nicely made , and not too heavy . i love this umbrella . originally purchased as part of a costume , but of course it would do nicely for any rainy day . 
my husbands has a lot of lucky brand jeans so last time they were for sale i decided to buy a pair of myself . i ' m 5f 7i and size 8 . i ordered a 29x34 because i like the extra length with heels and wasn ' t fully sure of the waist fit ( size 8 should be 28 ) . well , the pants say it is still a size 8 but i could have gone with the 28 ( although i don ' t mind the little extra room ) and the length is perfect for my ankle boots . the quality is very good and so far the color hasn ' t washed off . will buy more next time they go at 50 % sale 
bought these jeans right before i found out i was pregnant - they fit for a while after i started showing as they are stretchy . man was i glad i bought these ones ! 
i pretty much only wear lucky brand jeans , and i ' m always ecstatic when amazon has one of their daily deals on them . these jeans are a super dark wash and very stretchy . they ' re comfortable and fit as expected . 
these are the best flitting jeans . i tried not to have my expectations set to high since i have such a hard time finding the perfect fit in jeans . i am 5 ' 10 & # 34 ; tall and normally wear a size 12 jeans so i ordered a 32 . i am very pleased with my jeans and will definitely order this brand again . 
too bad that the size chart is a bit small . the chart told me that a size 29 should be ample and that i wouldn ' t be problem on my size 10 hips . when they arrived with a size 8 number tags all over them . i decided to try them , just in case . and they do fit , although they ' re tight . not & # 34 ; lie on the floor & # 34 ; tight , but tight enough . 
i like these pants but i don ' t love them . they ' re too big in the waist and there is too much of a flair . it feels more like yoga pants with a denim look . i save them for jean weekends at work . 
levi stopped making my go - to jeans a couple of years ago , and i ' ve been looking for some new basic jeans ever since . nothing really fit right until i tried these , and wow ! these look and feel great . i ' m not constantly adjusting the waist or shimmying around in them . they just feel effortlessly nice . i ' m 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; and ordered the short length , and i ' m not stepping on these at all . i ordered two more pairs and couldn ' t be happier with all of them . i only wish they had some in lighter colors too ! 
i am 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; ( barely ) and 125 pounds . my body type is average with more athletic ( bigger ) legs . i ' ve always had issues getting jeans to fit my thighs / calves . i usually have had to get a bigger size and they ' d be too big at the waistlucky jeans are the first brand of jeans that truly fit my body style and they are versatile so they fit a lot of different body types , too . i ' m a big fan of the lola boot cut and the sweet n low styles . these jeans are not an exception . they are stretchy enough to accommodate my legs and fit nicely around my midsection . they don ' t grab anything or make anything & # 34 ; spill & # 34 ; over the top - - they have a nice stretch which flatters . there is a slight flare at the bottom of the legs of the jeans which i would say is a bit more than a normal boot cut jean , but i like it especially since i have larger calves - - it draws the attention away from them . the lola boot cut are more like a traditional bootcut in my opinion . these are more like mid - rise jeans ( not low cut as the name implies ) so you don ' t have to worry about the derriere making any appearances even when you bend over . as for length - - i ' m short ( 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; ) and their & # 34 ; ankle & # 34 ; cut option is good for flats or even a slight heel . as for size - - i am normally a size 2 or 4 in jeans and knowing lucky brand , i always go to the higher end because they often run a bit small . so i got the 27 with a 30 & # 34 ; inseam and it fits perfectly . the color is true to the picture and the jeans are very soft and comfortable to wear . i ' d definitely recommend them ! 
this set is pretty flimsy . the garter especially has weak elastics and an & # 34 ; s & # 34 ; style clasp . the result is a belt that constantly slides down due to the tug of stockings . the clasp seems to because easily unhooked . moreover , after just a few washings the material started pilling . i purchased it mostly as this was the only option ordered in this color and it was inexpensive . 
really small . i love the lace look , but this isn ' t really plus size imo . i ' m a size 18 and it ' d probably fit a 14 / 16 more comfortably . it just bunches up on me . 
this is the third garter and panty set i have purchased , same type and again , great pink shade , good quality and an insane low price , and sexy without breaking the bank . . . . . . . . treat yourself to one in each color , as i plan to ! ! 
for what the size was it was much too small . did not fit at all and is extremely cheap material . 
i ' m a size 16 and this doesn ' t even come close to fitting me . i can ' t understand why they ' d call it & # 34 ; queen & # 34 ; size if it ' s mean for someone who ' s a size 4 . quality seems average . returned . 
shoulda ordered another size up i guess , on the pic , the skinny model makes it look like the belt is wide and gives some coverage . all my junk hangs out . but that ' s ok . . . it ' s not about my junk , now is it ? lol 
the fit and style of this lace garter is perfect ! hold up really well and fits nicely as an under garmet , doesn ' t show lines . 
i just wish it was more of a relaxed fit . bought a medium but feels more like a small because it ' s a very trim fit . prefer a little more room , but good quality & good price . 
i bought this shirt primarily for the gym , but could also wear it with jeans . fits good and looks great . 
these are nice but shrink a lot when put in the dryer , i would hang them up , or but 2 sizes larger . i bought several of these and had my company logo embroidered on the chest . the champion logo is also embroidered on these not printed ink . 
love this shirt i orderered in extra large because it all cotton like i dint want make the mistake of ordering large for my stocky thick self beautiful color and classy champion emlem on left sleeve 
ordered these for my husband and he loved them . they wash and dry and don ' t shrink or fade . champion is a great brand . champion 6 . 1 oz cotton tagless t - shirt with " c " logo in black - xx - large 
these are cut way too small and the only thing i can do is give it to a very skinny , little girl - someone 12 in my family who is taller than me and ' flat chested ' will be the only one capable of benefiting from this while they play outside or go biking . 
because i have a long torso , many brands of tees are just too short , but this brand is plenty long . material is also satisfactory . surprisingly , this shirt was literally came stuffed in a bag . . . all crumpled up . however after wearing it one hour , it was crumple free . 
bought these for my mom ( she loves hello kitty everything ) these pajamas are soooooo soft and great for summer and winter ! my mom loves these . great price 
my granddaughter love them , she was very pleased . she loves hello kitty stuff . she is 12 years old wasn ' t sure she would like them . 
i ordered the pajamas for my granddaughter . she loved them , they fit perfectly , thank you . they were exactly as shown in the picture . 
the t - shirt is a perfect weight and has held up under several wearings and washings thus far . the pants are a medium heavy micro - fleece and a bit too warm for me to sleep in , but still have a soft feel and nice to wear when bumming around the house . if you ' re looking for comfy and cozy , and you love hello kitty , you can ' t go wrong with these .
